Transcriptional response of murine microglia in Alzheimer’s disease and inflammation
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of late-onset dementia.
Microglia, the primary innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), have a complex role in AD neuropathology.
In the initial stages of AD, microglia play a role in limiting pathology by removing amyloid-β (Aβ) by phagocytosis.
In contrast, microglia also release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to promote neuroinflammation and exacerbate AD neuropathology.
Therefore, investigating microglial gene networks could identify new targets for therapeutic strategies for AD.
We identified 465 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in 5XFAD versus wild-type mice by microarray, 354 DEG in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated N9 microglia versus unstimulated control cells using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), with 32 DEG common between both datasets.
Analyses of the 32 common DEG uncovered numerous molecular functions and pathways involved in Aβ phagocytosis and neuroinflammation associated with AD.
Furthermore, multiplex ELISA confirmed the induction of several cytokines and chemokines in LPS-stimulated microglia.
In summary, AD triggered multiple signaling pathways that regulate numerous genes in microglia, contributing to Aβ phagocytosis and neuroinflammation.
Overall, these data identified several regulatory factors and biomarkers in microglia that could be useful in further understanding AD neuropathology.

Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of late-onset dementia.
In the United States, approximately 6.2 million people are living with Alzheimer's dementia, a number estimated to grow to 13.8 million by 2060 unless medical intervention strategies are developed for AD
AD neuropathology is defined by the aggregation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques followed by the development of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau
In addition to Aβ plaques and tau NFTs, neuroinflammation plays a key role in AD neuropathology, promoting numerous inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS)
Microglia, the primary innate immune cells of the CNS, have a complex role in AD neuropathology.
In the early stages of AD, microglia reduce Aβ accumulation by phagocytosis, and act as a defense barrier to protect plaque adjacent neurons from neurotoxic effects
Alternatively, microglia can contribute to neuroinflammation by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and other molecules associated with increased AD neuropathology
Although the role of microglia in AD is still not entirely understood, it is clear microglia play a key role in the development of AD neuropathology.
Since microglia appear to be an important factor in AD development, investigating microglial gene networks could lead to new therapies to treat AD.
Several studies have already highlighted the importance of specific genes involved in microglial metabolism
In this study, we investigated the transcriptional response of microglia in an AD versus non-AD state using microarray and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).
We identified 465 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in 5XFAD versus wild-type mice, and 354 DEG in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated N9 microglia versus unstimulated control cells, with 32 DEG common to both experiments.
Of the 32 DEG, functional enrichment analyses identified numerous processes and pathways in which microglia are potentially involved during AD development.
Furthermore, multiplex ELISA confirmed the induction of several cytokines and chemokines in LPS-stimulated microglia that were also differentially expressed in the microarray and RNA-seq datasets.
Overall, these data identify novel potential regulatory factors and biomarkers in the microglial response to AD.

Results

Transcriptome analyses of microglia in AD
Transcriptional analysis of LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus non-stimulated control cells was performed using RNA-seq.
A total of 354 significant DEG (log 2 FC > 1.5, FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.05) were identified with 323 upregulated genes and 31 down-regulated genes (Fig.
Interleukin-1 alpha (Il1α) was the most up-regulated gene (log 2 FC = 9.70) and albumin (Alb) was the most down-regulated gene (log 2 FC = -7.62)
(Table
We compared this data to publicly available data derived from sorted microglia from female 8-month-old wild-type and 5XFAD mice, a mouse model of AD which accumulates Aβ plaques
Transcriptional analysis of microglia from 5XFAD versus wild-type mice was performed by microarray
A total of 465 significant gene transcripts (FC > 2, FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.05) were identified with 337 up-regulated gene transcripts and 128 down-regulated gene transcripts (Fig.
Glycoprotein (transmembrane) nmb (Gpnmb) was   the most up-regulated gene transcript (FC = 46.43)
and X-linked lymphocyte-regulated 4B (Xlr4b) was the most down-regulated gene transcript (FC = -9.76)
(Table
In total, 32 genes overlapped between the N9 RNA-seq experiment and 5XFAD microarray dataset (Fig.
Of the 32 total genes, 31 were up-regulated and only one was downregulated (Table
The majority of the most up-regulated genes were cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Il1β, Tnf).
Transthyretin (Ttr) was the only down-regulated gene common to both datasets.

Pathway and functional prediction of microglia in AD
Geno ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analyses were performed on the 32 genes found in both the RNA-seq and microarray datasets.
Biological Process (BP) GO indicated the DEG participated in immune system process (Oasl2, Cd300lf, Prdm1, C3, Ifit2, Ifit3, Olr1, Tlr2), immune response (Oasl2, C d274, Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Il1β, Tlr2, Tnf), positive regulation of interleukin-8 (Il1β, Serpine1, Tlr2, Tnf), response to LPS (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Il1β, Irak3, Tlr2, Tnf), inflammatory response (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, C3, Il1β, Olr1, Tlr 2, Tnf), positive regulation of gene expression (Prdm1, Il1β, Plaur, Serpine1, Tlr2, Tnf), innate immune response (Oasl2, Prdm1, C3, Ifit2, Ifit3, Tlr2), regulation of cell proliferation (Prdm1, Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Serpine1, Tnf), positive ), and protein heterodimerization activity (Bcl2a1d, Irak3, Tlr2, Ttr) (Fig.
KEGG analysis was performed on the 32 common genes found in both the microarray and RNA-seq datasets to identify pathways associated with AD.
KEGG identified a total of seven pathways (P < 0.05) associated with the 32 genes (Fig.
The pathways included toll-like receptor signaling (Tlr2, Tnf, Il1β, Cxcl10), TNF signaling (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Il1β, Tnf), phagosome (C3, Itga5, Olr1, Tlr2), NOD-like receptor signaling (Cxcl2, Il1β, Tnf), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Il1β, Tnf), complement and coagulation cascades (C3, Plaur, Serpine1), and NF-kappa B signaling (Bcl2ald, Il1β, Tnf).
To further understand the interactions of the DEG, we performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis on the 32 genes found in both the RNA-seq and microarray datasets using STRING.
For the analysis, text mining, experiments, and databases were chosen for the interaction sources, and the high confidence value of 0.700 was selected as the minimum required interaction score threshold.
Of the proteins encoded by the 32 identified DEG, two distinct networks emerged with 15 proteins in one network (IL1β, Irak3, Il1rn, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Tnf, Tlr2, Olr1, Cd83, Cd69, Cd274, Serpine1, Plaur, Itga5, Mmp12), three proteins in the second network (Ifit2, Ifit2, Oasl2), and 13 of the proteins not clustering (Fig.
The database did not recognize predicted gene 1966 (Gm1966).
The results suggest that the given proteins were highly enriched (P < 1 × 10 -16 ).

Secretion of cytokines and chemokines by microglia
Since so many DEG were cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation, we performed multiplex ELISAs (22-plex) on supernatants from LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), primary microglia, and N9 microglia.
In BMDM, IL-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, RANTES, KC, MDC, TARC, and TCA-3 showed significant induction when stimulated with LPS versus non-stimulated control cells (Additional File 3).
In primary microglia, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, RANTES, KC, and MCP-1 all showed significant induction in LPS-stimulated primary microglia versus non-stimulated control cells (Fig.
In N9 microglia, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α, MIP-1α, and RANTES all showed significant induction in LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus non-stimulated control cells (Fig.
Cytokines and chemokines from BMDM, primary microglia, and N9 microglia that showed no significant difference between LPS-stimulated and control cells are shown in Additional File 4.

Discussion
A thorough understanding of the molecular characteristics and regulatory pathways of microglia is essential to develop therapeutic strategies for AD.
Accordingly, numerous studies have performed transcriptome analyses to elucidate the role of specific genes in microglia important in AD neuropathology, including Trem2 and ApoE
Other studies have investigated the transcriptome of microglia under distinct biological activities, such as Aβ plaque phagocytosis
In this study, we used a two-pronged approach to determine DEG in AD and inflammation.
First, we determined the DEG in microglia from 5XFAD mice versus wild-type mice by microarray.
We then determined the DEG in LPS-stimulated microglia using RNA-seq.
Altogether, 32 DEG overlapped between the two datasets.
Neuroinflammation by microglia is hypothesized to exacerbate AD neuropathology
In our study, several immunological pathways associated with inflammation were identified in AD-associated microglia that correlated with DEG of well-known pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1β, TNF, CXCL10, and CXCL2.
Caspase-1 dependent IL-1β secretion occurs during NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and activation of the inflammasome has emerged as an important mechanism in chronic neuroinflammation in AD
Furthermore, immunotherapies blocking inflammasome activation are being investigated for use in AD and other inflammatory diseases
BP GO analysis also identified Olr1 as an inflammatory and immune system response gene.
Several studies suggest a role for Olr1 in lipid metabolism, and genetic variation in Olr1 as a risk factor for AD
Furthermore, Olr1 was recognized as a gene involved in the phagosome pathway by KEGG, suggesting an important role in multiple AD pathogenic processes.
Genes not previously characterized in AD were identified by KEGG to be involved in molecular signaling pathways important in AD development.
The B cell leukemia/ lymphoma 2 related protein A1d (Bcl2a1d) was identified as being involved in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
Activation of NF-κB is an important mechanism in chronic neuroinflammation that significantly increases AD pathology
Furthermore, the plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (Plaur) was recognized as being associated with complement and coagulation cascades.
Complement and coagulation cascades are associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction and AD progression in mice
Characterization of these genes in the context of AD could further our Biomarkers can be a useful tool to predict and diagnosis a variety of neurological disorders, including AD
In our study, the only down-regulated gene amongst the 32 DEG was transthyretin (Ttr).
Indeed, Ttr has been implicated in numerous processes associated with AD, including Aβ binding
Ttr has been previously identified as being decreased in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
Several other DEG in our study could also potentially be used as biomarkers due to their highlevel of differential expression between groups (greater than threefold in both assays), including Ifit3, Cxcl10, Cxcl2, Il1β, Oasl2, Ifit2, and Slfn5.
Further investigation will be needed, as clinically useful biomarkers for AD should be inexpensive, non-invasive, reliably detectable and able to distinguish AD from other forms of dementia
There are several limitations of our study which are common to most studies directed at identifying dynamic alterations in gene expression networks in AD.
Microgliosis is a hallmark of AD neuropathology, resulting in large numbers of microglia concentrated around Aβ plaques
Since the role of microglia in AD is not fully understood, it is difficult to ascertain whether the altered genes identified in our study are involved in disease progression or in the neuroprotective microglia response.
Another caveat to our study is that murine microglia were used in both experiments.
Although the value of murine microglial research in AD cannot be overstated, the transcriptional signature of microglia in human AD is drastically different than that of murine microglia
When comparing human and mouse AD models, transgenic mice overexpress Aβ in a non-physiological manner, resulting in rapid Aβ accumulation and a higher plaque burden when compared to human AD
Fig.
STRING analysis was performed on the 32 genes found in both the RNA-seq and microarray data.
For the analysis, text mining, experiments, and databases were chosen for active interaction sources, and a high value of 0.700 was selected as the minimum required interaction score.
Line colors represent known interactions from curated databases (blue), experimentation (purple) and text mining (yellow)
Although the 5XFAD mouse model does not perfectly recapitulate human disease studies, comparing the microglial response in humans and mice have been mixed, with some indicating that the response may be different
This is likely due to differences in the complexity of human disease where both plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are present compared to the 5XFAD mice in which only plaques form.
Therefore, in vitro and in vivo models of AD remain powerful tools to begin to dissect underlying microglial gene regulatory mechanisms in early AD pathology.

Conclusions
In summary, we identified 465 DEG in 5XFAD versus wild-type mice by microarray, 354 DEG in LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus unstimulated control cells using RNA-seq, with 32 DEG common between both data sets.
Analyses of the 32 DEG uncovered numerous molecular functions and pathways involved in Aβ phagocytosis and neuroinflammation associated with AD that may be further investigated.
Furthermore, multiplex ELISA confirmed the induction of several cytokines and chemokines in LPS-stimulated microglia.
Overall, these data identified several regulatory factors and biomarkers in microglia that could be useful in further understanding AD neuropathology.
