The Potential of Ferroptosis-Targeting Therapies for Alzheimer’s Disease: From Mechanism to Transcriptomic Analysis
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, currently affects 40-50 million people worldwide.
Despite the extensive research into amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation (p-tau), an effective treatment to stop or slow down the progression of neurodegeneration is missing.
Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent and lipid peroxidation-driven type of programmed cell death, contributes to neurodegeneration in AD.
Therefore, how to intervene against ferroptosis in the context of AD has become one of the questions addressed by studies aiming to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ferroptosis in AD, when ferroptosis occurs in the disease course, and which ferroptosis-related genes are differentially expressed in AD remains to be established.
In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on cell mechanisms involved in ferroptosis, we discuss how these processes relate to AD, and we analyze which ferroptosis-related genes are differentially expressed in AD brain dependant on cell type, disease progression and gender.
In addition, we point out the existing targets for therapeutic options to prevent ferroptosis in AD.
Future studies should focus on developing new tools able to demonstrate where and when cells undergo ferroptosis in AD brain and build more translatable AD models for identifying anti-ferroptotic agents able to slow down neurodegeneration.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 44 million people worldwide
In AD, formation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are associated with progressive cortical and hippocampal neuronal dysfunction and death
Many cell death mechanisms have been studied in AD pathology.
The aggregation of Aβ was linked with caspase-9 and caspase-3-dependant apoptosis in neurons
Despite extensive research into main hallmarks and molecular pathways of cell death in AD, many degenerative processes cannot be explained by these mechanisms alone, resulting in failure of over 200 AD drugs trials aiming at these targets over the past decade
In addition to apoptosis and necrosis, ferroptosis, an iron dependent and lipid-peroxidation driven cell death
Ferroptosis, the process increasing with aging
Its hallmarks, such as increased iron levels and oxidative stress, have been long noted in the AD brain
It has been shown that formation of Aβ plaques and NFTs is related to iron overload in AD models and post mortem tissue
Moreover, iron levels positively correlate with cognitive decline in human subjects
Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) support these results by showing a relation between the risk of developing AD and GPX4 polymorphism
Moreover, PSEN1/2 mutations identified in Alzheimer patients affected the hypoxic response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts by regulating hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a driver of vulnerability to ferroptosis in cancer
These results suggest that higher risk of developing AD is associated with deregulation of ferroptosisrelated proteins, and thus ferroptosis inhibitors may have a therapeutic potential in AD
However, the underlying mechanism of ferroptosis in AD, and whether ferroptosis happens at the onset, during or as a consequence of AD remains to be established.
Our aim is to examine the potential of ferroptosis inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for AD.
We will first recapitulate ferroptosis pathway and its relation to AD, identify which ferroptosis-related genes are differentially expressed in AD and lastly, discuss the therapeutic options to prevent ferroptosis in AD.

PROCESSES INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING PATHWAY OF FERROPTOSIS
Ferroptosis mechanism can be divided into three parts: (1) iron homeostasis, (2) glutathione (GSH) metabolism and (3) oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (Figure
Disruption of one or more of these mechanisms can induce lipid peroxidation-driven ferroptotic cell death.

Iron Homeostasis
Iron homeostasis plays a key role in ferroptosis
Iron can enter the cell via transferrin 1 receptor (TfR1, also known as TFR1) and be reduced from ferric (Fe 3+ ) to ferrous (Fe 2+ ) form via metalloreductase STEAP3 in the endosome
In this form, iron can be stored in ferritin, or exported from the cell via ferroportin (FPN1)
Ferritin degradation via the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) contributes to ferroptosis by increasing the free intracellular iron levels
Excessive intracellular iron accumulation can lead to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction
Iron accumulation-induced ROS, such as superoxide anion (O 2 -•) and hydroxyl radical (•OH), possess an unpaired electron at their outer orbit which allows them to react with all cellular components including proteins, lipids and nucleic acid.
This results in lipid peroxidation, oxidative damage to membranes and other lipid-containing molecules, and ultimately to cellular damage and ferroptotic cell death

Glutathione Metabolism
On the other hand, inhibition of glutamate/cystine antiporter (system x c -, xc-, with xCT as the functional subunit of system x c -) and depletion of GSH cause inactivation of GPx4, the critical antioxidant enzyme and regulator of ferroptosis
This can lead to ferroptotic cell death through increased lipid peroxidation and accumulation of ROS
GPx4 reduces hydroperoxides of polyunsaturatedfatty-acid-containing-phospholipids (PL-PUFA(PE)-OOH) to polyunsaturated-fatty-acids (phosphatidylethanol amine)reduced (PL-PUFA(PE)-OH)
GPx4 uses GSH as a reducing substrate and converts it into oxidized form, also referred to as glutathione disulphide (GS-SG)
Apart from nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, coded by NFE2L2 gene)

Oxidative Stress and Lipid Peroxidation
Oxidative stress occurs due to the imbalance between generation of free radicals and the ability to neutralize or eliminate them through antioxidants
One of the main drivers of ferroptosis is ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation, which can result in oxidative stress
Inhibition of GPx4 and decrease in GSH levels lead to activation of 12/15lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX, which is the protein product of the ALOX15 gene).
The association of Fe 2+ with lipoxygenases (LOX, a dioxygenase containing non-heme iron) can lead to oxygenation of polyunsaturated-fatty-acids (PUFA), such as arachidonic acid present in phospholipids, and trigger lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis
The LOX nomenclature is defined by the specific site of their oxygenation product: in humans there are six LOX isoforms 15-LOX-1, 15-LOX-2, 12-LOX-1, 12-LOX-2, E3-LOX, and 5-LOX, of which -, Glutamate/cystine antiporter system; TfR1, Transferrin 1 receptor; Vit E, Vitamin E; γ-GCS, Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase.
This figure was created using Biorender.
12/15-LOX (15-LOX) are the most abundant.
12/15-LOX are considered as one of the key regulators of ferroptotic cell death
Although, this has been supported by the findings that pharmacological inhibition of 15-LOX-1 exerts a cytoprotective effect
In addition to iron accumulation-induced generation of ROS, mitochondria also contribute to ROS production.
Electrons leak from complex I and III of the electron transport chain (ETC) located on the inner membrane of mitochondria
This can result in the formation of ROS such as O 2 -• and hydrogen peroxides (H 2 O 2 ), and potentially can lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( m)
Reduced m was associated with ferroptosis and involves different regulatory mechanisms than apoptosis
GSH depletion-induced activation of 12/15-LOX can increase cytosolic Ca 2+ via both (1) the import from the extracellular compartment and (2) release from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum
Decrease in GSH levels can also lead to dysregulation of Ca 2+ transport in and out of mitochondria by voltage dependant anion channels (VDAC) and mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU)
This results in mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload and collapse of the mitochondrial function which activates Ca 2+ -dependant proteases
Consequently, ROS-induced transactivation of BH3 interactingdomain death agonist (BID) to mitochondria and Ca 2+ overloadinduced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus causes the cell to die
This caspase-independent process is accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation and enlarged cristae
The rescue of mitochondria

CONTRIBUTIONS OF FERROPTOSIS TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Iron Homeostasis
Advanced age is associated with iron dysregulation affecting most of our organs
Many studies show that iron dysregulation can also contribute to AD pathology
With aging, iron deposits in the brain
Imaging and histological experiments support this by showing increased iron deposition in AD-specific brain regions
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed increased iron levels in the putamen, pulvinar thalamus, red nucleus, hippocampus, and temporal cortex of AD patients
Later, quantitative susceptibility mapping showed higher iron levels in caudate and putamen nucleus of AD patients than in controls.
Interestingly, the increased iron level in the left caudate nucleus correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment
Finally, higher iron levels in the frontal cortex were associated with AD severity
This evidence suggested that iron contributes to AD pathology and presented an important avenue for therapy development

Glutathione Metabolism
Ferroptosis can be induced by compounds interfering with system x c -, such as erastin, which induces cysteine deprivation, GSH depletion, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and cell death
System x c -can also be inhibited by adding small concentrations of sorafenib
Inhibition of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) results in GSH depletion and can lead to ferroptosis
Irreversible and direct inhibition of GPx4 by the (1S,3R)-RSL3 (RSL3), causes the production of polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-containing-phospholipid hydroperoxides, which leads to lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death
In addition to pharmacological compounds, genetic modifications targeting regulators of the system x c
-can induce ferroptosis.
The Gpx4BI-KO mouse was generated by a conditional deletion of Gpx4 in forebrain neurons by administration of tamoxifen.
In this mouse model, 75-85% decrease of Gpx4 was shown to induce hippocampal neuronal loss, lipid peroxidation, neuroinflammation and spatial learning deficits
Similarly, the knockout of Gpx1, facilitated memory impairment induced by β-Amyloid in mice
The Western blot analysis of AD post mortem brain tissue revealed enhanced expression of the light-chain subunit of the xCT
These results suggest that impaired GSH metabolism might play a role in ferroptosis during AD pathology

Oxidative Stress and Lipid Peroxidation
The brain is the most vulnerable organ to oxidative stress.
It represents only 2% of the body but uses 20% of the total oxygen supply
Oxidative stress plays a key role in AD pathology by initiating the generation and enhancing of both Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylation of Tau (p-Tau)
Oxidative stress can be enhanced in AD via metal accumulation.
In addition to iron, the Aβ precursor protein (APP) has a high affinity to binding zinc and copper at the N terminal metal-binding sites
Additionally, high concentrations of these metals were also found in Aβ plaques in mouse and human brain
As copper is the potent mediator of •OH, and the binding of zinc leads to production of toxic Aβ and further uncontrolled zinc release, these metals can contribute to the increase of oxidative stress in AD
Post mortem tissue from AD patients shows higher levels of oxidized bases in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes compared to control subjects
Other studies have shown higher level of lipid peroxidation, in diseased regions of AD brain compared to controls
These results support that oxidative stress might be an important factor contributing to the development and progression of AD

DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF FERROPTOSIS-RELATED GENES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Many AD differentially expressed genes (DEGs) have been identified in animal and human studies.
Using available RNAseq datasets of AD mouse models, AD patients and age-matched controls, we analyzed which of the 44 ferroptosis-related genes are differentially expressed in AD (Supplementary Table
To this end, we analyzed the expression of ferroptosis-related genes in one mouse [Alzmap
All four datasets were available to the public and compared the gene expression between cell types, stages of disease progression and gender.
We first used the Alzmap gene retrieving function to make a qualitative assessment of the expression of three representative ferroptosis-related genes.
We included (i) Gpx4, as it can suppress phospholipid peroxidation, an important process during ferroptosis, (ii) Gss, as it can facilitate the production of GSH, and (iii) Acsl4 for its role in supporting the incorporation of long PUFAs into lipid membranes, a process associated with ferroptosis (Figure
We choose t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) statistical method to visualize the representative genes in a high-dimensional dataset (Figure
However, Alzmap website offers other modes of analysis and visualization tools such as the principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projections for dimension reduction (UMAP).
The distribution and visualization of the chosen genes might render different output since these methods of visualization and reduction tools are based on specific clustering algorithms, i.e., unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction and data visualization technique for very high dimensional data for PCA, while t-SNE is based on a non-linear statistical method, calculating the similarity probability score in a low dimensional space.
Therefore, visualization of genes could appear to render various outcomes.
The alterations observed in the ferroptosis-related genes generated by Alzmap are purely based on a qualitative assessment.
These data can be freely accessible on the
In the Alzmap study, one left and one right hemisphere was collected for each experimental group and analyzed according to the spatial transcriptomic manual (Stockholm, Sweden)
Our analysis revealed Gpx4 upregulation and Gss and Acsl4 downregulation in App NL-G-F knock-in AD mice compared to WT mice.
Although this analysis shows that these ferroptosis-related genes are differentially expressed in App NL-G-F knock-in AD mice, it is known that downregulation of Gpx4 and upregulation of Acsl4 can induce ferroptosis
Our observation from the TSNE analysis can be explained by cells trying to increase resistance against ferroptosis by increasing the generation of antioxidants (from the observation of increased Gpx4) and depleting the substrates for lipid peroxidation (as Acsl4 gene expression was found decreased)
In the second study containing the scREAD dataset
Data was acquired by single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq)based differential expression analysis and assessed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test and false discovery rate (FDR) multiple-testing correction
Our analysis revealed that ferroptosis-related genes in excitatory neurons from human brains are mostly downregulated at an early clinical stage of AD, while they are upregulated at a later clinical stage of the disease relative to early stage (Table
The same was observed with inhibitory neurons, astrocytes and glia cells.
For instance, genes which are important for ferroptosis resistance [e.g., ACSL3, ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), GPX4, GSS and voltage-dependent anion channel 2 and 3 (VDAC2/3)] are downregulated in an early stage of AD pathology but upregulated at later AD stage.
This could imply that ferroptosis already happens at early stages of the diseases.
The shift from downregulation to upregulation at later stages can be explained by cells trying to compensate and rescue the ferroptotic cell death by increasing the expression of antioxidant proteins and enzymes.
Furthermore, the observation that neurons show a higher number of ferroptosis DEGs in AD than astrocytes and oligodendrocytes suggests that ferroptosis affects neurons and glia cells differently
Although it seems from this dataset that ferroptosis gene expression changes primarily in neurons, it might be because glia cells were not primarily sorted out in this study.
Therefore, next we analyzed a dataset that specifically looked at glia cells.
To further investigate how ferroptosis could affect glia cells in AD, we looked at the difference in expression of ferroptosisrelated genes in microglia between control and AD brains containing only amyloid-β plaques in the occipital cortex (OC) and both amyloid-β and tau pathology in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC)
In this study, the differential expression analysis was performed using a logistic regression and adjusted p-value below 0.05 was used to determine the significance
Microglia belonging to different subclusters (homeostatic, Aβ-related = AD1 and tau-related = AD2) showed changes in the expression of ferroptosis-related genes between AD and control subjects (Table
Microglia affected by Aβ pathology alone, or the combination of Aβ and tau pathology showed more DEGs than cells in the homeostatic subcluster.
Microglia in the Aβ-related subcluster showed increase in the expression of ferroptosis-related genes, while microglia in tau pathology-related subcluster showed decrease in the expression of these genes.
As the presence of tau pathology in OC is typical for later stages of the diseases, these results could suggest that there seem to be a difference between the expression of ferroptosis-related genes between early and late stages of AD.
However, whether glia cells die via ferroptotic cell death at later stages of AD should be investigated further.
Previous analysis of the whole brain human DEGs in AD revealed more AD-DEGs in women than men
To see whether this is also specifically true for ferroptosis-related genes, we analyzed the 44 ferroptosisrelated genes in the AMPA-AD dataset where AD-DEGs were compared between genders (Table
The sample size included 478 AD (female: 318, male: 160) and 300   The differentially expressed genes were determined as those with FDR P < 0.05 using weighted fixed/mixed effect linear models using the 'voom-limma' R package.
Data was analyzed based on

Log-fold change
control (female: 148, male: 152) cases on which sex-stratified meta-analysis
Our analysis revealed three downregulated genes in both men and women while only GSS was downregulated in both.
Only one gene, Cytochrome B-245 Beta Chain (CYBB), was upregulated in men while eleven genes were upregulated in women (Table
The analysis of the dataset available in this study indicates that like AD-DEGs, ferroptosis-related genes seem to be more differentially expressed in women than men.
Finally, nine of the 44 ferroptosis-related genes were not differentially expressed in any of the analyzed datasets (Supplementary Table

INHIBITION OF FERROPTOSIS TO TREAT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
An increasing amount of literature suggests that anti-ferroptotic therapies may be efficient in AD

Iron Homeostasis
Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that FTH1, component responsible for iron storage, is differentially expressed in early and late stages of AD.
Furthermore, excessive iron deposition in specific brain areas contributes to AD pathology
Therefore, an increased interest in the development of therapeutic strategies targeting iron has emerged in the past years.
In animal models, DFO treatment decreased AD hallmarks, iron overload, iron-induced kinase activity [cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)], mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic loss, and neuronal damage
DFO increased expression of transferrin receptor (TfR1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leading to reduced iron-induced memory deficits in rodents
In a clinical trial, DFO slowed down the progression of AD in patients
However, the dosing regimens need to be standardized before DFO could be implemented in the clinical setting
In addition, to reduce DFO-related cytotoxicity and prolong its presence into circulation, new DFO component-containing nanogels were proposed as promising alternatives for ironchelation in AD
Besides AD, DFO alone or co/treatment with ferrostatin (Fer-1, inhibitor of lipid peroxidation) also improved α-synuclein-induced pathology in a PD animal model
PBT1, a drug inhibiting zinc and copper ions from binding to Aβ, reduced Aβ deposition, attenuated astrogliosis and prevented memory impairment in AD animal models AD
In pilot-phase 2 clinical trial, PBT1 reduced Aβ plasma levels and, when looked specifically on severely affected AD patients, PBT1 was able to slow down the clinical decline
PBT2, a second-generation 8-hydroxyquinoline analog produced as a successor to clioquinol, induced GSK3β phosphorylation and prevented formation of Aβ in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells
In
animal models of AD, PBT2 induced Aβ plaque degradation, decreased p-tau, rescued decreased spine density, increased brain-levels of BDNF and improved cognitive performance
PBT2 was also assessed in a phase 2 clinical trial, where it lead to reduced levels of Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid and improved executive function compared to placebo
However, PBT2 did not show any significant effect on cognition.
Currently, deferiprone (DFP), a compound that alleviates symptoms related to PD pathology
As previously reported, iron chelators can attenuate symptoms and slow down the progression of AD, which shows the potential for novel therapeutic approaches

Glutathione Metabolism
The revealed differential gene expression of GPX4 and GSS suggests that modifying the expression or/and the activity of these gene-encoded proteins might be beneficial to treat AD.
The expression of GPx4 can be directly upregulated by α-Lipoic acid (LA)
LA treatment on P301S Tau transgenic mice enhanced the activity of system x c -, GPx4, superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), CDK5, GSK3β, TfR1 and FPN1
LA reduced the hippocampal levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), as well as the calcium (Ca 2+ ) content, p-tau, calpain1 levels, and synaptic loss.
As a result, these processes led to enhanced memory function
Apart from LA, GPx4 can be activated in an indirect manner through Nrf2.
Nrf2 plays an important role in neurodegeneration and ferroptosis by regulating a wide range of genes
In addition to the activation of GPx4 and GSH synthesis
Nrf2 can be upregulated using a human lentiviral vector or compounds such as sodium arsenite, triterpenoid, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid-methylamide (CDDO-MA), dl-3-n-butylphthalide (DI-NBP), kavalactone methysticin, carnosic acid (CA) and sulforaphane (SFN).
Nrf2 upregulation increased heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) levels and decreased AD hallmarks, hippocampal inflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ-induced memory deficits in AD mouse models
Finally, genetic downregulation of Kelch-like ECHassociated protein 1 (Keap1), the negative regulator of Nrf2, in ArcAβ42 flies, activated Nrf2, induced Aβ42 degradation, prevented neuronal toxicity in response to Aβ42 peptide, rescued neuronal-specific motor defects and increased life span
Altogether, these results suggest that inhibition of ferroptosis by targeting GSH metabolism is an important avenue for the development of new therapies for AD

Oxidative Stress and Lipid Peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation represents an important hallmark of AD
In many studies, oxidative stress was targeted to reduce neuronal damage and alleviate symptoms related to AD pathology.
Anti-ferroptotic compounds that reduce oxidative stress include liproxstatin 1 (Lip-1) (inhibitor of ROS and lipid peroxidation), chalcones 14a-c (inhibitor of Aβ and lipid peroxidation), Selenomethionine (Se-Met) (inhibitor of lipid peroxidation), CMC121 (fatty acid synthase inhibitor), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (free radical scavenger), Vitamin E (Vit E) and PD146176 (15-LOX-1 inhibitor).
Studies using in vitro and in vivo models of AD have shown that targeting oxidative stress has a positive effect on neural degeneration, inflammation, Aβ1-42 aggregation, p-tau formation, GSH levels, iron overload, mitochondrial function, motor dysfunction and learning and memory
In concordance with these results, clinical trials have shown that NAC and co-treatment of NAC, Vit E and Se-Met improved behavioral symptoms, general well-being, and neuropsychiatric and cognitive scores of AD patients
Although Vitamin E treatment had no beneficial effect on patients with mild cognitive impairment
Considering the lack of adverse events of these antioxidants, ferroptosis inhibition by targeting oxidative stress is a new promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

DISCUSSION
Improved understanding of underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis in AD may lead to the development and application of anti-ferroptotic strategies to slow down or prevent AD progression
Iron accumulation
Our analysis of DEGs in AD revealed that differential expression of ferroptosis-related genes in AD affects mostly neurons and that the changes observed in glia cells could be related to both tau phosphorylation and Aβ accumulation.
This may explain the difference in the expression of ferroptotic markers between early (Aβ) and late (Aβ + p-tau) stages of AD.
Even though this review has shed more light on the role of different brain cell types in ferroptosis during AD, whether ferroptosis in glia cells is related to later stages of the pathology should be investigated further.
While it is known that AD brain shows ferroptosis characteristics, it is unknown what is the causal relationship between AD and ferroptosis.
Plasma ferritin increases with increasing age and Aβ deposition.
Recent work on the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation in C. elegans revealed extended life-and health-span independently of other mechanisms
This evidence suggests that ferroptosis may be an age-related as well as disease-related process
Therefore, ferroptosis inhibition may not only lead to slowing down the neurodegeneration but also contribute to longer health-span
Iron dysregulation aggravates formation and aggregation of both Aβ and p-tau protein forming plaques and NFT respectively
Even though the link between ferroptosis and Aβ has been extensively studied, much less is known about its role in NFT formation.
Therefore, future studies should try to investigate the role of ferroptosis in hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and formation of fibrillary tangles independently of Aβ pathology.
This could be achieved by comparing the characteristics of ferroptotic cell death in AD with patients with primary age-related tauopathy (PART)
Further research should also address the effect of ferroptosis on the interactions between different cell types in AD context.
Although cell-cell interactions are dysregulated in AD brain
The brain-on-a-chip platform using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) -derived neurons and glia from AD patients could allow a high throughput screening of the effect of anti-ferroptotic drugs in AD, while mimicking the cellcell interactions in AD context
Moreover, this model is easily reproducible and thanks to the use of iPSCs from AD patients, also more translatable to humans compared to well-established animal models.

CONCLUSION
This review summarizes the evidence supporting the important role of ferroptosis in AD pathology and presents what is known about the targets for its inhibition for a potential treatment.
Ferroptosis-related genes are differentially expressed in AD, supporting our hypothesis that ferroptosis inhibition could slow down the AD progression and memory decline, however, many questions remain unanswered.
Developing new AD models allowing us to study how ferroptosis effects cell-cell interaction is needed to understand the causal relationship and timing of ferroptosis in AD.
Future efforts should be directed toward developing detection techniques of ferroptosis in vivo and organizing large, randomized clinical trials of anti-ferroptotic drugs in early and late stages of AD progression.
