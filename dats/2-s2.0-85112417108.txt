Dietary and supplemental long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as moderators of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease
Purpose There is an ever-growing body of literature examining the relationship between dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 PUFAs) and cerebral structure and function throughout life.
In light of this, the use of ω3 PUFAs, namely, long-chain (LC) ω3 PUFAs (i.e., eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate cognitive impairment, and progression to Alzheimer's disease is an attractive prospect.
This review aims to summarise evidence reported by observational studies and clinical trials that investigated the role of LC ω3 PUFAs against cognition impairment and future risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Methods Studies were identified in PubMed and Scopus using the search terms "omega-3 fatty acids", "Alzheimer's disease" and "cognition", along with common variants.
Inclusion criteria included observational or randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with all participants aged ≥ 50 years that reported on the association between LC ω3 PUFAs and cognitive function or biological markers indicative of cognitive function linked to Alzheimer's disease.
Results Evidence from 33 studies suggests that dietary and supplemental LC ω3 PUFAs have a protective effect against cognitive impairment.
Synaptic plasticity, neuronal membrane fluidity, neuroinflammation, and changes in expression of genes linked to cognitive decline have been identified as potential targets of LC ω3 PUFAs.
The protective effects LC ω3 PUFAs on cognitive function and reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease were supported by both observational studies and RCTs, with RCTs suggesting a more pronounced effect in individuals with early and mild cognitive impairment.
The findings of this review suggest that individuals consuming higher amounts of LC ω3 PUFAs are less likely to develop cognitive impairment and that, as a preventative strategy against Alzheimer's disease, it is most effective when dietary LC ω3 PUFAs are consumed prior to or in the early stages of cognitive decline.

Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive impairment
Encompassing a collection of syndromes, dementia is characterised by progressive impairment of memory, language, behaviour and visuospatial function, leading to compromised independence
It is estimated to affect 50 million people globally
The most common of these diseases is Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing 60% to 80% of dementia cases
No treatment has yet been found to prevent or cure cognitive impairment or its progression to dementia and AD
Cognitive impairment, especially difficulty retaining new information, is an early marker of AD.
Numerous clinical tests have been validated to evaluate different aspects of cognition that can identify individuals at increased risk of AD within a few years (e.g., rate of learning over time, immediate recall, and delayed recall)
In addition to memory and recall, episodic assessments can be used to assess specific neurocognitive functions: problem-solving, planning, language, attention, and visuospatial skills.
The diagnosis of cognitive impairment and elevated risk of AD is defined by guidelines set by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association
The guidelines offer flexible assessment criteria to match the assessor's expertise (general practitioner vs specialist), accessibility to diagnostic resources (e.g., image scanning and blood biomarkers), and the cognitive challenges presented by the patient.
In light of this flexibility, there is acknowledgment that the AD population is not homogenous, but a heterogeneous population of subgroups defined by their cognitive abilities and diagnostic criteria
The effect of age on cognitive impairment is undeniable; however, it is important to evaluate the effect of modifiable environmental factors, such as diet, both on the prevention of cognitive decline and onset of AD.
Indeed, identifying cardinal risk factors that commonly contribute to early cognitive impairment and risk of AD, could help (i) identify individuals at high risk of cognitive impairment, (ii) project an individual's progression toward AD, and (iii) inform strategies to delay the onset of AD.

PUFAs as mediators of cognitive impairment
There is general agreement across studies and study design, of an association between healthy diets, cognitive function, and risk of AD
That is, prudent and 'Mediterranean' diets, characterised by greater intake of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, associate with reduced risk of cognitive impairment, compared to 'Western' diets characterised by processed foods, saturated fats, refined grains, and added sugars
PUFAs, lipidic molecules defined by the presence of more than one double bond in the aliphatic chain, are typically more abundant in healthy 'whole food' diets, such as those consumed in prudent and 'Mediterranean' diets.
The two main series of PUFAs are omega-3 (ω3): α-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5); and omega-6 (ω6): linoleic acid (LA, C18:2) and arachidonic acid (ARA, C20:4)
Precursor ω6 and ω3 PUFAs, LA and ALA, are essential fatty acids determined by diet as they cannot be endogenously synthesised by humans
ALA, found in high concentrations in chia seeds, walnuts, and oils of flaxseed, canola and soybean
Delta-6 desaturase, the enzyme required in the first rate-limiting stage of ALA conversion
The rate of ALA conversion is, therefore, generally low at less than 5%
Food sources of EPA and DHA notably consist of fish and seafood products, including fish oils
Mean intakes of EPA and DHA through food in the UK have been estimated at 244 mg/day
However, PUFA intake is perhaps best predicted by the ω6:ω3 ratio present in the diet, rather than the intake of a single PUFA.
While ratios between 1:1 and 5:1 have demonstrated positive effects in ameliorating general disease burden
The chronic low-grade inflammation induced by this 1 3 aspect of diet may have consequences for neuronal health, generating an environment that impairs cognitive function and fosters AD pathology
Structurally, ω3 and ω6 LC PUFAs comprise around 30-35% of fatty acids in the brain

Membrane fluidity
The fatty acid composition of cell membranes affects the membrane fluidity index by influencing membrane packing
The abundance of LC PUFAs within the phospholipid fractions of the brain, predominantly DHA and ARA
Following a decrease in absorption across the blood-brain barrier and changes to fatty acid metabolism, the aging brain sees a decrease in membrane LC PUFA concentration
Interestingly, aged-related membrane rigidity has been reversed in the hippocampus of pre-clinical AD models through a DHA-enriched diet

Gene expression
LC PUFAs are implicated in the expression of several genes
Targets for modulation are primarily from the nuclear receptor superfamily, namely, the retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)
They function as ligand-activated transcription factors in retinoid signalling
Interestingly, LC ω3 PUFAs show a greater potency in modifying nuclear receptor gene expression compared to LC ω6 PUFAs
PPAR can bind to multiple fatty acids and their derivatives; however, PUFAs, in particular EPA, show superior binding affinity compared to ω6 PUFAs and saturated fatty acids
Furthermore, increased ω3 intake may increase transthyretin
The aggregation and deposition of Aβ 42 fragments as neuropathological plaques is considered a primary hallmark of AD
A human model of AD has shown that over-expression of transthyretin supresses Aβ plaque formation, putatively through sequestration
Collectively, this positions modification of dietary LC PUFAs as a viable approach to improve cognitive function in AD; however, heterogeneity of effect sizes in human trials

Inflammation
Eicosanoids are a group of inflammatory mediators that include prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes
PUFAs act as precursors to the synthesis of eicosanoids through metabolism by cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzymes
ARA, a 20-carbon LC ω6 PUFA, is in plentiful supply in neural cell membranes, making it the primary substrate for the majority of eicosanoid production
ARA-derived eicosanoids, which include the 2-series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, as well as the 4-series of leukotrienes
Conversely, EPA, a 20-carbon LC ω3 PUFA, competes with ARA for COX and 5-LOX enzymes
In addition, EPA is a precursor for lesser pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, namely, the 3-series of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and the 5-series of leukotrienes
Of particular interest is neuroprotectin D1, which can inhibit COX2 expression, reduce ARA metabolism
In summary, evidence from molecular, epidemiological, and preclinical and human studies elucidates dietary LC ω3 PUFAs as mediators of cognitive decline and risk of AD; however, a summary of current literature is required to critique and evaluate the strength of existing evidence linking dietary LC ω3 PUFAs with cognitive decline and explain the heterogeneity observed in study results.
By understanding the primary mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of cognitive decline and AD, we are well positioned to offer an evaluation of this evidence.
In doing so, we aim to determine the role of dietary and supplemented LC ω3 PUFAs as moderators of cognitive decline and risk of AD.

Method
PubMed and Scopus databases were searched, using "omega-3 fatty acids", "Alzheimer's disease" and "cognition" as key search terms, as well as variants of these ("n-3 fatty acids, "PUFAs", "AD").
Inclusion criteria were: (i) original randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies; of (ii) human participants ≥ 50 years; (iii) investigating the association between dietary or supplemented ω3 PUFAs; on (iv) qualitative or biological assessment of cognitive function; (v) as a marker of AD risk.
Exclusion criteria were: (i) in vitro or (ii) preclinical studies, and (iii) non-original or (iv) non-peer-reviewed publications.
No exclusion regarding initial publication date was set and all studies published up to March 2020 were eligible.
Identified studies were then compiled into tables to assess and compare the participant sample profile, methods, and outcomes in a clear and concise manner (see Tables

Results
Eight observational studies and 25 RCTs were selected for review (see Supplementary Fig.

Observational studies
The data from observational studies generally support an inverse association between dietary LC ω3 PUFA intake and cognitive decline and risk of AD (Table
The Rotterdam Study (1997) is the earliest account in this review of the link being demonstrated in a population-based cohort of elderly subjects (≥ 55 years).
Data from this study showed a relative risk (RR) of AD at 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1-0.9)
with daily fish consumption above 18.5 g
Interestingly, a follow-up study in 2009 reported contrasting results
Fish, total ω3, EPA and DHA intake of 5395 subjects did not associate with AD
The 10-year follow-up period may have meant that baseline dietary information was not representative of the participants' diets throughout the duration of the study; however, this does not rule out the potential relevance of earlier dietary habits in AD development.
Further studies have reported similar results
adjusted for age, sex, race, education, energy intake and presence of the ApoE ɛ4 polymorphism
Although this result was near borderline significance (p = 0.07), the inverse, linear association between total ω3 PUFA intake and AD showed clear significance (p = 0.01)
This relationship was also seen for DHA intake specifically, with those in the top three quintiles of intake showing multivariate-adjusted RR as low as 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.8)
As less than 1% of the cohort reported taking ω3 PUFA supplements, it can be deduced that this intake was primarily achieved through diet.
A later prospective study by Schaefer et al.
compared to those in the lower three quartiles.
Although of similar magnitude, the association between plasma DHA and AD was not significant (RR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.31-1.18;
p= 0.14) when upper and lower quartiles were compared
The dietary intake of DHA was also high for these subjects in the cohort, at 1800 mg/day.
Fish intake was significantly associated with plasma DHA; however, once adjusted for plasma DHA, the association between dietary fish and DHA intake and AD was not significant
This suggests that DHA is the primary component of fish effecting AD risk and underlines the importance of DHA bioavailability and absorption into the blood, which can be improved by co-ingestion of a high fat meal alongside supplement use
In addition, variability of fish DHA content (% fatty acids) between species and global region
A more recent community-based cohort study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, identified a decreased risk of AD in participants with the highest adherence scores to MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) and Mediterranean diets, with hazard ratios (HR) at 0.47 (95% CI: 0.26-0.76),
0.61 (95% CI: 0.38-0.97)
and 0.46 (95% CI: 0.26-0.79),
respectively
In particular, the MIND diet showed a HR of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.44-0.98)
even with moderate adherence
In addition to adequate intake of fish, the diet consists of 15 'brain-healthy' food aspects, including increased fruit and vegetables and reduced red meat and butter, which make it difficult to deduce the role of LC ω3 PUFAs in ameliorating AD risk from these results.
These findings agree with previous work investigating the combined effects of multi-nutritional LC ω3 PUFAs-rich drinks
The same cohort was tested for cognitive ability using a 21-test battery to assess global cognition and five specified cognitive domains, including episodic memory and visuospatial ability
Although ω3 PUFAs from food sources were not associated with cognition, ω3 supplementation was significantly associated with slower rates of decline in global cognition and episodic memory scores compared to non-consumers
This suggests that an increased habitual intake of ω3 PUFAs reliably delivers an adequate dosage to influence cognitive outcomes.
Several of these studies also identified a significant relationship between increased ALA consumption and reduced AD risk, but interestingly only in ApoE ɛ4 carriers
In summary, observational studies support the notion that LC ω3 PUFAs offer a protective effect against cognitive decline and risk of AD.
The period of study in observational studies is far longer than can be realistically achieved in a clinical setting, meaning that prolonged exposure to dietary LC ω3 PUFAs can be represented in analysis, in comparison to a transient response to increased LC ω3 PUFA intake.
However, the observational studies identified in this review were conducted on European and American populations, meaning that these data may not be generalisable to other populations with varying ratios of ApoE polymorphism, and differing quantities and sources of fish and LC ω3 PUFA consumption.
Future epidemiological studies are required to evaluate the distinct and interactive associations between LC ω3 PUFAs and foods they are commonly consumed alongside (i.e., as in a Mediterranean diet) and the effect of cooking methods on the efficacy of LC ω3 PUFAs.
Concurrent dietary parameters such as increased fruit and vegetable intake and decreased saturated fat intake may also play a role in cerebral health and support the metabolic effects of LC ω3 PUFAs.

Clinical trials

Cognitive testing
The OmegAD trial
Subjects were randomised to receive either ω3 PUFA capsules (1700 mg/day DHA and 600 mg/day) for the full 12 months of the study, or 6 months of placebo capsules followed by 6 months of ω3 PUFA capsules.
Scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the cognitive portion of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) were taken at baseline, 6 and 12 months; however, no statistically significant differences in scores between the two groups were established
A subgroup of 32 patients with very mild AD (MMSE > 27 points) showed a significant attenuation of cognitive decline compared to placebo, as indicated by MMSE score after 6 months of intervention
A further study as part of the OmegAD trial found that the diminution of cognitive decline as measured by ADAScog scores was significantly associated with increasing plasma DHA, and that plasma EPA was associated with a number of parameters within the ADAS-cog
Similar conclusions can be drawn from a shorter trial by Chiu et al.
Although the mixed model indicated a positive change in global clinical function in the intervention group, as measured by Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC), the improvement of ADAS-cog score over the intervention was selective to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI); no effect was seen in AD patients.
Intriguingly, this study reported lower levels of plasma ARA in the ω3-treated group compared to the control
Increased EPA on erythrocyte membranes was associated with improved ADAS-cog scores
Zhang et al.
Following 12 months of supplementation with 2000 mg DHA/ day, the intervention group achieved significantly higher test scores for Full Scale Intelligence Quotient and subdomains of Information and Digit Span
In a follow-up paper after 24 months of supplementation, the authors reported the same significant improvements as seen after 12 months, with an additional improvement in Verbal Intelligence Quotient
This dosage has also been trialled in patients with mild to moderate AD (MMSE 14-26), but there was no significant effect on rate of cognitive decline as indicated by ADAS-cog and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
It may be important to note that one of the placebos used in these studies was soybean oil, known to contain, amongst other fatty acids, a significant amount of ALA
Indeed, as a precursor for LC ω3 PUFA, it is likely that a small percentage of ALA was synthesised into EPA or DHA and contaminated the control group; however, without another control group, the magnitude of contamination cannot be determined.
The efficacy of LC ω3 PUFA supplementation on MCI has been further investigated by a number of trials
Yurko-Mauro et al.
After 24 weeks of treatment (900 mg/day), the intervention group had significantly fewer Paired Associate Learning pattern errors than placebo subjects, as well as improved immediate and delayed Verbal Recognition Memory
These changes were significantly associated with increased plasma DHA levels, of which the intervention group exhibited a twofold rise in plasma DHA
Improved immediate verbal memory has also been reported in MCI patients treated with DHA-EPA combination supplements
Interestingly, this study
Increased concentration of ARA in neuronal membranes may have increased the fluidity index of brain cells in the treated group, consequently leading to improved synaptic function.
By contrast, AD subjects did not exhibit any improvement in immediate memory
Similar findings were documented in another trial
These studies raise questions regarding the effects of study parameters, such as study duration and dosage, that may have contributed to the results of trials successfully associating LC ω3 PUFAs with improved cognition in MCI.
Specifically, they suggest that durations of ≥ 5 months and DHA supplements exceeding 900 mg/day, are required to elicit a significant effect on cognitive ability in elderly populations.
Several large-scale trials (n ~ 1600-3400), including the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) and Alpha Omega Trial, have found no association between LC ω3 PUFAs and cognition, both in those with memory complaints
Although these studies use large sample sizes and substantial intervention periods, the dosage of LC ω3 PUFAs are comparatively lower than in other trials conducted in this area (Table
While these levels better mimic the level of ω3 PUFAs achievable through the diet, the results of studies using higher supplementary doses have more consistently reported significant effects of LC ω3 PUFAs on cognitive function in MCI
Interestingly, a secondary analysis of MAPT study subjects with memory complaints in the lowest quartile of ω3 index revealed an increase in Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) scores for the intervention group over the 36-month intervention, where the control group experienced a decrease in mean score
Although this was the only finding to achieve statistical significance, the intervention group performed better than the placebo group in all other tests conducted
Interestingly, a smaller 6-month trial (n 199) supports these findings in cases of MCI, reporting no significant change in MMSE or Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) following ω3 PUFA supplementation
Scheltens et al.
A significant improvement was reported in revised Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R) delayed recall score, although ADAS-cog and CIBIC scores did not change.
A subgroup analysis of patients with very mild AD also achieved significantly improved immediate verbal recall after 12 weeks
A 24-month trial on a similar population with prodromal AD (mean age 71, mean MMSE 26.7) has since been conducted to establish the longer term influence of Souvenaid
The authors reported a moderately positive effect based on lower rates of cognitive decline in the intervention group than were expected based on projected 24-month decline observed in AD patients
However, no significant effect on the composite score of the neuropsychological test battery used was reported
Souvenaid contains a combination of other nutrients including vitamin C (80 mg) and a number of B-vitamins (3 μg B12, 1 mg B6, 400 μg folic acid).
Interactions between B-vitamins and ω3 PUFAs in affecting reduced rates of brain atrophy have been reported in MCI
Although the efficacy of B-vitamin treatment in AD is still yet to be thoroughly established
The Souvenaid trials raised questions about the combination of ω3 PUFAs with other agents in supplementation.
Shinto et al.
Although no significant difference was found in ADAS-cog scores, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scores of probable AD subjects showed significantly less decline over the 12-month trial period for both ω3 and ω3-α-lipoic acid groups compared to placebo; however, a significant difference between MMSE scores for treatment and placebo groups was only observed in the case of combined ω3-αlipoic acid supplementation
As levels of endogenous α-lipoic acid decrease with age
In the placebo arm, the authors used a capsule containing soybean oil and 5% fish oil
While the ω3 concentrations may not have been as high as in the intervention arm, the potential influence on results is worth noting.

Biomarkers
As well as cognitive testing, numerous studies also measured biological changes as indicators of cognitive function
As part of the OmegAD study, 35 AD subjects were randomised to 6-month supplementation of ω3 PUFAs (1700 mg/day DHA 600 mg/day EPA) or placebo
Plasma samples were tested at baseline and 6 months for the inflammatory markers IL-6, tumour necrosis factoralpha (TNF-α) and soluble interleukin-1 receptor type-II (sIL-1RII).
Cerebrospinal fluid was extracted by lumbar puncture at baseline and 6 months and tested for IL-6, TNFα, sIL-1RII, as well as tau protein, hyperphosphorylated tau protein and Aβ peptides, all hallmarks of AD pathology
A significant association between sIL-1RII and Aβ 42 was made at baseline; however, no associations related to ω3 PUFAs were found with any of the biomarkers measured
The same sample was examined for changes in urinary F2-isoprostanes and prostaglandin F2 α , both formed through COX pathways associated with oxidative stress
15-keto-dihydro-PGF2 α , a metabolite of prostaglandin F2 α , was used as a biomarker of inflammation.
No changes were observed in any of these biomarkers.
Further research on ω3 PUFA supplementation and F2-isoprostane levels in cases of probable AD reached a similar conclusion
However, neither study reported a qualitative assessment of cognitive function at baseline and follow-up, so it is not possible to confirm the null hypothesis or validate the association between biomarkers and cognitive function.
A number of biomarker studies have reported associations between ω3 PUFAs and quantitative indicators of cognitive function
A cerebral perfusion study revealed increased cerebral blood flow and volume in posterior corticoid regions of MCI subjects following high dose ω3 PUFA supplementation (880 mg/day DHA and 1320 mg/day EPA) for 6 months
Cerebral hypoperfusion has been associated with AD as a consequence of neuronal tissue damage and brain atrophy
Although no statistically significant effect of 18-month high dose DHA supplementation was reported in slowing the rate of brain atrophy in cases of mild to moderate AD
In another study, administration of a drink containing 1000 mg DHA and 1000 mg EPA amongst other nutrients, including vitamin D and resveratrol (Smartfish), was significantly associated with increased Aβ phagocytosis by monocytes as indicated by flow cytometry in MCI and pre-MCI subjects, but not in AD
These studies further support the efficacy of LC ω3 PUFAs as early interventions and suggest that physical brain measures, while time-consuming and costly, provide a more reliable measure of cognitive degeneration compared to blood and cerebrospinal fluid analytes.
The largest biomarker study identified in this review, with more than 100 subjects, was undertaken by Faxén-Irving and colleagues, as a further part of the OmegAD trial
Transthyretin, a Aβ binding protein thought to reduce plaque formation
174 patients with mild to moderate AD completed two consecutive 6-month supplementation periods as two groups-ω3/ω3 and placebo/ω3.
Plasma transthyretin levels after 6 months significantly decreased in the placebo group, at which point a correlation was identified between DHA and transthyretin (rho = 0.17, p = 0.03)
At the 12-month follow-up, after both groups had been supplemented with ω3 PUFAs, plasma transthyretin increased significantly in both groups, at which point a correlation was identified between MMSE scores and transthyretin (rho = 0.16, p = 0.03), alongside an inverse correlation with ADAS-cog scores (rho = -0.2,
p = 0.02)
Cerebrospinal fluid was analysed over 6 months in a subset of 35 subjects; however, the increase in cerebrospinal fluid transthyretin observed in the ω3/ω3 treatment group was not significant
This trial is one of few that offers evidence that ω3 PUFAs may improve cognition in those with established AD.
In controlled trials, participants have usually already received a diagnosis of AD, meaning that ω3 PUFAs are tested for their treatment effect on a disease that has already been established with notably manifested symptoms of memory impairment.
Indeed, based on the data reviewed here, wherein the majority of clinical trials that made positive associations between supplementation and cognition were conducted in cases of MCI as opposed to AD, a protective effect of ω3 PUFAs is inferred.

Conclusion
Cognitive impairment and AD present major challenges for clinical medicine, with multi-faceted pathologies that are still not entirely understood.
The role of environmental factors to prevent cognitive impairment and subsequent AD continues to be an area of extensive research, particularly pertinent to late-onset cases.
Due to their widely recognised influence on cognitive function, ω3 PUFAs present a compelling opportunity for nutritional therapy in cognitive decline and AD.
Evidence from observational studies appears promising for prevention of cognitive decline.
Regular consumption of LC ω3-PUFA rich foods in healthy populations without preexisting AD or dementia suggests a protective effect against future AD.
Conversely, clinical trials that primarily focus on participants already diagnosed with AD consistently report no effect.
The incongruence between these findings highlights the precedence of LC ω3 PUFA intake earlier in life, before cognitive decline is apparent and AD risk has been recognised.
Although many observational studies adjusted for known confounders, including the ApoE ɛ4 allele, this was not consistent across the literature.
Those that specifically analysed ApoE ɛ4 suggest that the metabolic effects of different LC ω3 PUFAs differ between ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers; therefore, more targeted studies within this high-risk population are warranted to better understand ɛ4-specific effects of different types of LC ω3 PUFAs.
Overall, LC ω3 PUFA supplementation appears to be well-tolerated, even in high doses (Table
Although LC ω3 PUFAs may not be a validated treatment strategy for cognitive impairment or AD based on the current evidence, their successful implementation as an early intervention strategy for neuroprotection in MCI and healthy older populations is encouraging.
Large-scale trials of long duration (≥ 5 months) using higher dosage supplements (900 mg DHA/day) across diverse populations are required to validate these findings, to improve generalisability and determine safe and optimum dosage.
Furthermore, the combination of LC ω3 PUFAs with other nutrients of interest, such as α-lipoic acid and B-vitamins, is an intriguing area of research that may identify additional supplementation strategies and nutrient interactions to prevent and ameliorate cognitive decline in the elderly.
