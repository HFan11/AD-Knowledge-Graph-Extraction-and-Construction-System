Epigenetics in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with unknown pathogenesis and complex pathological manifestations.
At present, a large number of studies on targeted drugs for the typical pathological phenomenon of AD (Aβ) have ended in failure.
Although there are some drugs on the market that indirectly act on AD, their efficacy is very low and the side effects are substantial, so there is an urgent need to develop a new strategy for the treatment of AD.
An increasing number of studies have confirmed epigenetic changes in AD.
Although it is not clear whether these epigenetic changes are the cause or result of AD, they provide a new avenue of treatment for medical researchers worldwide.
This article summarizes various epigenetic changes in AD, including DNA methylation, histone modification and miRNA, and concludes that epigenetics has great potential as a new target for the treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with an incidence of 10% in people over 65 years old and 40% in people over 85 years old, and the number of confirmed cases is expected to increase to over 91 million worldwide by 2050
A loss of short-term memory, reduced sense of direction, decreased expression ability and progressive changes in personality are typical clinical manifestations of AD
AD can be classified into two main types: earlyonset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD).
EOAD develops cognitive impairment before the age of 65 and accounts for approximately 5% of all cases; LOAD develops cognitive impairment after the age of 65 and accounts for more than 90% of diagnosed AD patients
As confirmed by a large number of studies, the main pathological manifestations of AD are extraneuronal amyloid plaque (Aβ) deposition and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
Hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which has over 40 phosphorylation sites, is the main component of the tangles
A recent autopsy study indicated that p-tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) was the most important phosphorylation site in the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease and control brain tissue
Aβ and tau protein deposition can affect signal and substance transmission between neurons, leading to neuronal degeneration and death
During the preclinical stage, subjects are cognitively unimpaired but show evidence of cortical Aβ deposition, which is considered the most upstream process in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease
There are reports that in AD familial mutation carriers, Aβ starts accumulating over two decades before any symptoms appear, followed by brain metabolism decline 6 years prior to and brain atrophy approximately 5 years prior to any symptoms
In view of the hypothesis that Aβ accumulation is the underlying etiology, researchers have conducted a large number of in-depth and extensive studies aimed at revealing the pathogenesis of AD to find ways to treat AD.
Unfortunately, these studies all ended in failure.
In the face of the global surge in the diagnosed population of AD, it is urgent to find a new direction of treatment for AD, shown in Figure
In the middle of the twentieth century, Waddington first linked developmental biology with genetics and put forward the concept of "epigenetics"
With the continuous progress of research, the concept of epigenetics is constantly improving.
At present, epigenetics is generally defined as "to make structural and biochemical changes in chromatin without changing the DNA sequence, and then regulate the expression of related genes, thus affecting various physiological and pathological processes"
These changes include DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, histone modifications (histone methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation), and non-coding RNA changes.
Epigenetics has been shown to control the transcription of genes related to cell differentiation
Some studies have proposed that AD is not simply an advanced or exacerbated state of normal aging, but is instead a dysregulation of normal aging and normal aging might provide protection against AD-epigenetics may be involved
The occurrence and development of AD follow a non-Mendelian etiology, with both genetic and environmental modification factors
Individuals carrying autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations with near 100% penetrance develop dementia when aged approximately 30-60 years
However, not all ε4 carriers who survive to an advanced age develop AD, and an epigenomic factor associated with a reduced proportion of activated microglia (microglial epigenomic factor 1) appears to attenuate the risk of ε4 for AD
In the AD brain, at the sub/cellular level, the dysregulation of several molecular pathways and intracellular signaling occurs, including Aβ and tau proteostasis, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, inflammatory-immune responses, lipid and bioenergetic metabolism, and oxidative stress
In addition, increasing evidence has shown that an imbalance in epigenetic mechanisms may be the basis of abnormal expression of synaptic plasticity-and memory-related genes in AD
Here, we provide a brief review of the epigenetic changes in AD and further corroborate that epigenetic factors may be useful biomarkers to diagnose AD and therapeutic targets to treat AD.

DNA METHYLATION AND HYDROXYMETHYLATION IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
DNA methylation refers to the process of forming 5methylcytosine (5mC) by a covalent bond with the cytosine 5 carbon site of the CpG dinucleotide in the genome under the action of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (Figure
5mC can interfere with the binding of transcription factors to recognition sites on promoters or recruit transcription suppressor methyl-CpG-binding proteins to alter the chromatin structure and inhibit transcription
5mC can be oxidized into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5carboxylcytosine (5caC) by ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes
5hmC is the intermediate product of DNA methylation and demethylation, which adds a layer of complexity to the epigenetic regulation of both.
5hmC has been found in various mammals
In contrast to 5mC, 5hmC is related to gene expression activation in the brain
For example, the content of 5hmC in the brain of AD is positively correlated with the level of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene
In addition, 5hmC is also involved in physiological processes, such as cell differentiation, neural development and aging
Some studies have found that 5hmC is selectively lost in hippocampal neurons and neocortical neurons in patients with AD and model mice, and this loss is significantly related to age and is aggravated after Aβ treatment.
However, this change is not obvious in cerebellar neurons
In addition, the loss of TET enzymes is consistent with that of 5hmC in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and TET can inhibit the neuropathophenotype (Aβ aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation) and prevent synaptic dysfunction in mice
Moreover, the decrease in 5hmC and TET levels in the hippocampus of AD mice coincides with abundant Aβ plaque accumulation.
In the early disease stage, the decline in TET levels in the hippocampus leads to a decrease in 5hmC content, which causes the appearance of pathological features, and these changes are alleviated after the restoration of TET expression
Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of 5hmC, which is the result of the downregulation of TET, is closely related to the degree of AD neurodegeneration.
However, the current research on 5hmC is not mature, and conflicting results have been reported in several studies
The specific role of dynamic changes in 5hmC contributing to AD remains to be further explored.
5mC is the most well-studied epigenetic modification and it plays a critical role in brain development
Studies have shown that the levels of 5mC in the middle temporal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus of AD patients increase significantly and are positively correlated with Aβ, NFTs and ubiquitin load
The entorhinal cortex is a critical brain region affected by Alzheimer's disease
Researchers have found hypermethylation of the ANK1 gene in the entorhinal cortex and similar methylation in the superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex
In addition, methylation changes have also been found in ABCA7, BIN1 and other genes associated with the development of AD
The hypermethylation of these genes is often accompanied by the deposition of large amounts of amyloid protein, suggesting that these changes are related to the pathology of AD, but these changes have also been found in the brains of some patients without cognitive impairment.
In these patients, only low amounts of amyloid protein deposition were found, indicating that DNA methylation may be involved in the very early pathological changes of AD
At present, only a small number of genetic variations described as risk factors for AD, such as genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), which include ANK1, ABCA7, BIN1, and others, are associated with LOAD
In the 1990s, the pathogenic relationship between amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin1 (PSEN1) and AD was proven by genetic methodology, in which PSEN1, as the active site of the secretase, can influence the function of neuron γ secretase in AD patients, increase the level of plasma Aβ42 and accelerate the development of AD
The MAPT gene is a risk factor for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.
Studies have shown that overexpression of PSEN1 can reduce the activity of the MAPT promoter, leading to an increase in methylation of the endogenous MAPT promoter, thus causing AD
Vitamin B12 (vitB12) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the principal methyl donors, decrease with age in patients with AD
Homocysteine (HCY) is remethylated to methionine, which is, in turn, transformed to SAM.
SAM can give the methyl group to DNA (among other substrates) through the action of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes family with formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).
SAH, an inhibitor of DNMTs, is then transformed to HCY.
Essential cofactors of HCY metabolism are folate, vitB12 and vitB6.
And high HCY and low vitB (folate, vitB12 and vitB6) levels are positively associated with
Studies have shown that in human neuroblastoma cells and the specific brain regions of AD mouse model, such as the frontal cortex and hippocampus, showing about 3.5-and 1.3fold increase, respectively, in PSEN1 expression in vitB deficient conditions, whereas SAM is able to restore PSEN1 normal expression
PSEN1 5 -flanking region has a sitespecific (only few CpG moieties) methylation pattern that could change in response to metabolic stimuli, vitB deficiency (resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia in mice) causes PSEN1 overexpression through DNA demethylation which can be prevented by SAM
Further study found that in the abovementioned cells and mouse brain, the level of overall cytosine methylation is very low in control and almost unaltered in vitB deficiency conditions.
However, it is worthwhile to underline that overall CpG methylation is high and significantly decrease when vitB deficiency
It means that vitB deficiency mainly affects CpG methylation, through site-specific regulation of cytosine methylation regulating PSEN1 expression
Interestingly, after SAM treatment, not only CpG methylation but also non-CpG methylation increased significantly
It is not clearly, at present, whether an increase in non-CpG methylation would affect the expression and function of PSEN1
Significance and functions of non-CpG methylation in mammals is still a new and not wellknown research field
In addition, during the early stage of AD, the formation of Aβ and tau tangles can demethylate beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (bace-1) DNA in the brain, while administration of SAM can eliminate this hypomethylation and restore cognitive function
Other studies have shown that DNA methylation often interacts with multicomb-inhibitory complex 2 (PRC2), resulting in reduced silencing of neurodegenerative genes involved in PRC2 and thus affecting neural development
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous disease, and the prevalence varies greatly according to the environment, follow-up years, medical clinic and other factors
Patients do not show clinically significant memory impairment and may be classified as amnestic or non-amnestic
However, with the passage of time, some patients with MCI may gradually develop progressive cognitive decline and changes in personality and behavior, eventually evolving into dementia, particularly AD
At the present time, no "cure" for AD is known, but early treatments can slow the cognitive and functional decline and reduce the associated behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of AD
In addition, accurate early identification of AD (MCI) may increase opportunities for the use of newly developed interventions designed to delay or prevent progression to more debilitating stages of the disease.
Studies have shown that in patients with MCI, DNA methylation levels of CpG_ 19 of NUDT15 and CpG_11 of TXNRD1, which are redox-related genes, had significantly negative correlations with folate and positive correlations with Hcy, and the interactions of folate and Hcy with DNA methylation could influence cognitive performance
Peptidase M20-domain-containing protein 1 (PM20D1), a biosynthetic enzyme for a class of N-lipidated amino acids in vivo, is associated with the development of AD.
Researchers have shown that the initial promoter hypomethylation of PM20D1 during MCI and early-stage AD is reversed to eventual promoter hypermethylation in late-stage AD, which helps to complete a fuller picture of methylation dynamics
In recent years, many biomarkers of aging based on DNA methylation have been developed, such as the multitissue DNA methylation-based (DNAM) age estimator, also known as Horvath's clock, phenotypes of age estimator, and single-tissue age estimator (Hannum's clock)
It has been reported that the DNAM epigenetic clock in the AD cortex is associated with AD neuropathological phenomena such as diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques and amyloid accumulation and is related to the decline in the overall cognitive and memory function of AD individuals
Although it is not clear what functional aspects of aging can be detected by these markers, examining the relationship between these DNA methylation-based biomarkers of aging and agerelated performance indicators may be an approach to assessing healthy aging, of which behavioral and cognitive functions are important components
At present, research on DNA methylation in AD has been relatively mature, involving blood, cerebrospinal fluid and different regions of the brain
For example, an increase in DNA methylation at 208 CpG sites in the homeobox gene (Hox) cluster is significantly associated with AD neuropathology in the prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus
In the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, 130 differentially expressed genes were screened, and their expression was related to DNA methylation
Methylation of genes, including ABCA7, BIN1, SORL1, and SLC24A4, was found to be significantly associated with Aβ load and tau entanglement in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
Although no treatment based on DNA methylation has been developed, there is no doubt that DNA methylation is a potential therapeutic target for AD.

HISTONE MODIFICATION
The nuclear duplexed DNA of eukaryotic cells wrapped around histones and organized into chromatin
Both histones and DNA can affect chromosome structure through covalent modification and then regulate gene expression.
There is sufficient evidence about the cytotoxicity of histones
In addition, it has been reported that nuclear-like proteins similar to eukaryotic histones can prevent promoters from binding to transcription factors and inhibit gene expression at the genomic level
These results may suggest the side effects of histones on gene expression to some extent.
Histone posttranslational modification (PTM), also known as epigenetic markers, mainly includes methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, and ADP ribosylation, which can affect gene expression by changing chromatin structure
Studies have shown that histone markers are significantly correlated with the pathological features of AD, such as abnormal tau phosphorylation and Aβ protein plaques

Histone Methylation in Alzheimer's Disease
Histone methylation (the addition of methyl groups to the N-terminal of lysine or arginine under the action of histone methyltransferase) can change the structure of chromatin (Figure
Lysine can be monomethylated, dimethylated and trimethylated, and arginine can be monomethylated and dimethylated
Lysine methylation at the fourth position of histone H3 (H3K4) is one of the most studied histone methylations and is related to gene expression activation.
In addition, H3K4 methylation is associated with synaptic transmission, shaft bursts, and nerve development, all of which affect the development of AD
Histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) may promote the expression of memory-related genes and proteins such as ZIF268 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
Among them, ZIF268 plays an important role in the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, and knocking out ZIF268 in the hippocampus during object recognition memory (ORM) reintegration deletes active recognition memory traces
The deletion of the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2B can significantly reduce the levels of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, leading to the differential expression of some genes, such as Egr1, c-Fos, and GluR1, in the hippocampus.
Among them, downregulation of the learning-dependent synaptic plasticity genes Egr1, CREB and GluR1 resulted in impaired memory function in mice
Experiments have shown that APP-mediated reduction of histone H4 acetylation can also downregulate the transcription of Egr1, c-Fos, and BDNF
RAN, a key nuclear and cytoplasmic transport molecule that is significantly decreased in neurons of patients with AD, was only weakly expressed in the nucleus.
Some studies have confirmed that a defect of RAN may cause H3K4me3 to accumulate abnormally in the cytoplasm due to its inability to enter the nucleus and then it co-distributes with early tau markers PG5 and MC1.
However, it appears earlier than these markers, suggesting that H3K4me3 cytoplasmic accumulation is one of the earliest manifestations of AD cell pathology
Injection of rn-1 into AD model mice to inhibit the demethylation of histone K4 and K9 mediated by the LSD1 enzyme
In addition, the level of SAM is significantly decreased in the AD brain
A number of experimental results have confirmed that histone methylation interferes with AD mainly by affecting the expression of genes and proteins related to learning and memory, synaptic transmission and neuronal growth.

Histone Acetylation in Alzheimer's Disease
Histone acetylation is the addition of an acetyl group to the N-terminal lysine residues of histones by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which leads to a more open chromatin structure (Figure
Compared with methylation, histone acetylation has a tendency to promote gene expression
In particular, histone acetylation in the central nervous system plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes related to learning and memory
Histone acetylation is catalyzed by five histone lysine acetyltransferase families [KAT2A/GCN5, KAT2B/P300/CBPassociated factor (PCAF), KAT6-8, and CREBBP/cAMP reaction element binding protein (CBP), EP300]
Among them, CBP and P300 play a neuroprotective role in the development of AD, and their abnormal expression leads to neuronal apoptosis and neurodegenerative disease through activation of caspase-6
P300 inhibitors can inhibit the expression of PSEN1 and bace1 by reducing H3 acetylation in the promoter region
Some studies have shown that the acetylation of H2B and H4 in the hippocampus of rats can enhance the expression of memory-related genes, thereby enhancing their spatial memory ability
Moreover, the acetyltransferase Tip60 induces gene transcription by forming a polymer in the cytoplasm with a ligand of APP and an intracellular subdomain of APP, which increases the acetylation of Tip60-dependent histone H3K14 and H4K5
This acetylation leads to a decrease in the expression of cytoskeleton-associated proteins and damages the stability of microtubules, thus affecting the NFTs of AD
Experiments have shown that increasing the Tip60 level in Drosophila melanogaster can effectively prevent cognitive deterioration and amyloid accumulation
In contrast, it was found that the levels of histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC1, HDAC3, HDAC4, and HDAC6, in patients with MCI and AD were significantly higher than those in the control group
The removal of histone acetyl from nucleosomes by neuron-specific overexpression of HDAC2 can promote chromatin densification and reduce the transcription of corresponding genes, thus reducing synaptic sensitivity, synaptic number, synaptic plasticity and memory function
For example, in wild-type mice and rats, synaptic plasticity and memory formation are promoted after treatment with HDAC inhibitors
It was found that the acetylation level of histone H4 is significantly decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of AD transgenic mice and primary neurons cultured from AD transgenic mice, while the HDAC inhibitor 4-PBA can increase the gene transcription of many genes and reverse the spatial learning and memory impairment of AD mouse models
The above studies have shown that HAT and HDAC inhibitors can increase the level of histone acetylation, enhance the expression of memory-related genes, prevent cognitive degeneration and Aβ protein deposition, affect abnormal tau phosphorylation, and reduce NFT formation, thus delaying the progression of AD, while deacetylase has the opposite effect.

Histone Phosphorylation in Alzheimer's Disease
Phosphorylation refers to the process of adding phosphate groups to intermediate metabolites or proteins under the action of phosphotransferase (Figure
Protein phosphorylation usually occurs on serine or threonine residues
H2AX is a member of the H2A histone family and a component of the nucleosome structure.
It has been found that when DNA damage occurs in astrocytes, the serine at position 139 (S139) of H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated to produce γH2AX, while the level of γH2AX in astrocytes in AD susceptible regions (hippocampus and cerebral cortex) increases significantly, suggesting that there is a close relationship between H2AX phosphorylation in astrocytes and AD
In addition, in neuroblastoma with overexpression of APP, it was found that the S47 phosphorylation level of H4 was 1.89 times higher than that of the control group, and significant phosphorylation of H4 was also found in the brains of patients with mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that this histone phosphorylation may play a role in promoting the pathological development of AD
H3 is mainly distributed in the hippocampal CA-1 region and hypothalamus.
Studies have shown that phosphorylated H3 is increased in hippocampal neurons in patients with AD, and the activated phosphorylated H3 is mainly confined to the cytoplasm of neurons, which can lead to neuronal mitotic disorders, neurodegeneration and apraxia

Histone Ubiquitination in Alzheimer's Disease
Ubiquitin is a small protein that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and ubiquitination means adding one or more ubiquitin molecules to the substrate protein for reversible PTM.
These modifications cause proteins to undergo proteasomedependent degradation or change their location or activity in various cellular processes
Ubiquitination plays a decisive role in clearing toxic metabolites accumulated in the brain through the ubiquitin proteasome system
It has been confirmed that E3 ubiquitin ligase is related to the production of Aβ
Some studies have shown that the ubiquitination of H2B K120 in the brains of patients with AD is 91% higher than that of the control group
Bmi1 is one of the components of PRC1, and the Bmi1/Ring1 protein complex can activate E3-momo-ubiquitin ligase on H2A K119 and ubiquitin H2A K119 to maintain transcriptional inhibition of developmental genes
In the AD brain, Bmi1 is silenced, and H2A ubiquitination is significantly decreased, resulting in Aβ protein deposition, p-tau accumulation and neurodegeneration
In addition, learninginduced monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2Bubi) is required for increases in the transcriptionally active H3K4me3 mark at learning-related genes in the hippocampus, and the loss of H2Bubi prevents learning-induced increases in H3K4me3, gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation
The study of histone ubiquitination in the brain and learning is still in the exploratory stage, but the limited results suggest that there are relationships between histone ubiquitination and AD.

NON-CODING RNA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a vast and diverse family of non-protein-coding transcripts that modulate cell function by controlling gene expression programs through many different mechanisms, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs)
Among these, lncRNAs are defined as RNAs that have a transcript length exceeding 200 nucleotides and will not be translated into proteins
The mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate gene expression are rather complicated, studies have found that they can bind to DNA directly or transcription factors, target mRNAs, miRNAs, or proteins and modulate their activities and stability, and can also interfere with chromatin complexes to repress or activate gene expression in an epigenetic fashion
More recently, a growing body of evidence has begun to emphasize lncRNAs modulation in other diverse physiological and pathological processes.
Among these, neurological is an area of particular interest, especially in AD.
Several lncRNAs, such as BACE1-AS, 51A, BC200, and NDM29, have been found to be aberrantly expressed in AD compared with healthy controls and were involved in AD pathogenesis by the low-throughput experiments
In addition, it has been reported that there is a region-specific and age-dependent expression of lncRNAs in AD and control groups, such as a significant increase in brain precentral gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, and becomes more significant with age
These findings demonstrated that the regulation of lncRNAs networks exerts unneglectable influence on the pathology of AD and that lncRNAs may shed new light on the unclear etiology of AD and the current unsatisfactory drug therapy.
microRNAs, as the most studied lncRNAS in AD, are also the focus of our attention.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional gene silencing factors that are a class of 22 nt long non-coding regulatory RNA molecules.
By binding to the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of specific gene mRNAs, miRNAs can induce mRNA degradation or inhibit translation, leading to gene silencing.
miRNAs have been predicted to regulate up to 90% of human genes
Among all known miRNAs, approximately 70% are expressed in the brain
Studies have shown that differentially expressed miRNAs and differentially expressed target genes are found in the parietal and frontal lobes of the brain, where AD is most likely to occur.
Then, through further functional analysis and data mining, it was found that the downregulation of miR-26b-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-107, and miR-103a-3p in the parietal lobe and the upregulation of HA-miR-7, HA-miR-128, HA-miR-29c, HA-miR-136 in the frontal lobe are closely related to AD
It has been reported that miRNA-7, miRNA-9-1, miRNA-23a/miRNA-34a, miRNA-125b-1, miRNA-146a, and miRNA-155 are significantly increased in the AD-affected superior temporal lobe neocortex
Moreover, downregulation of miRNA-188-5p leads to synaptic and cognitive dysfunction, which is eliminated by its overexpression
HSA-miR-219 has been found to promote neurodegeneration through posttranscriptional regulation of the tau protein.
Increased expression of miR-15a can inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and tau protein phosphorylation, thereby improving cognitive dysfunction in mice, alleviating pathological damage in the hippocampus of AD mice, and inhibiting hippocampal neuronal apoptosis
In addition, some types of miRNAs have been shown to be associated with AD susceptibility and are potential blood biomarkers of AD
For example, the expression levels of miRNA-146b-5p and miRNA-15b-5p, which are related to innate immunity and apoptosis, are downregulated in the blood of AD patients and are significantly positively correlated with brain amyloid, while they are not brain-or AD-specific miRNAs
The content of miRNA-483-5p is positively correlated with age and the Dementia Rating (DR) scale, and plasma miRNA-483-5p, as a non-invasive biomarker for the early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, is significantly increased in patients with AD
In addition, microglia, the resident immune effector cells of the central nervous system, are indispensable regulators that initiate the inflammatory response, Aβ aggregation, neuronal loss and memory impairment in AD
Moreover, the formation of inflammatory bodies and the activation of the protease caspase-1 can cause the release of IL-1β and IL-18
The increase in these inflammatory mediators is significantly related to the severity of AD
Many studies have shown that innate immune signals and activation of inflammatory bodies are a defense mechanism in patients with AD, but overactivation can lead to neuroinflammation and brain damage.
Balancing the host's innate immune response has always been considered a potential means for the treatment of AD

CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
The pathogenesis of AD is complex and still unknown, and the prevention and treatment of AD is a global problem.
As mentioned above, a growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic factors are involved in the course of AD and that various epigenetic changes closely influence the development of AD.
However, additional studies are necessary to determine whether these epigenetic changes are the cause of AD or the result of AD development and the exact role they play in the pathogenesis of AD.
In this review, we summarized the results of many experimental studies and found that in AD.
As Figure
HATs and HDACs inhibitors can reverse these changes and prevent AD; (4) the increased phosphorylation of histones can be related to the pathological phenomenon of AD, resulting in memory impairment; (5) ubiquitination changes can cause Aβ deposition and lead to neurodegeneration; and (
Moreover, due to the differential expression of miRNAs in AD, a number of miRNAs have been proposed as blood markers for the early diagnosis of AD.
Epigenetic mechanisms may regulate the expression of related genes in the early stage of the disease, and thus, changing the factors related to the development of the disease in patients with AD could be used for the prevention and treatment of AD.
These changes suggest potential therapeutic research directions for AD.
Shown by Figure
HDAC inhibitors have been shown to reduce the amount of phosphorylated tau related to learning and memory in the brain and downregulate the aggregation of tau associated with neuronal apoptosis to improve cognitive dysfunction in mice
Recent studies have found that a synthetic bs-5-YHEDA peptide
Furthermore, by phosphorylating the transcription factor p-ETS1, the bs-5-YHEDA peptide reversed the transcription of SLC40A1 and upregulated ferriportin in the brains of senile mice, thus enhancing the excretion of iron accumulated in the aging brain and consequently protecting neurons and alleviating symptoms such as AD (Figure
That is, intervening in epigenetics may block the progression of AD or improve the condition of the patients.
Epigenetic interference is a potential therapeutic for AD, and developing relevant drugs is promising for the treatment of AD.
In addition, the results have shown that most of the epigenetic phenomena in AD are related to the pathology of AD, and some epigenetic changes may appear before the pathological changes, suggesting that these epigenetic changes may provide a diagnostic tool for AD and that targeting these changes could be a way to prevent and treat AD.
