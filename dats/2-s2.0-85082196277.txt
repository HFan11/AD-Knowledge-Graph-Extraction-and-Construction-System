Pathological manifestation of the induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived cortical neurons from an early‐onset Alzheimer's disease patient carrying a presenilin‐1 mutation (S170F)
Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
These abnormal proteins induce disturbance in mitochondrial dynamics and defect in autophagy system.
Since presenilin-1 (PS1) is a core component in γ-secretase complex, the mutations of PS1 gene cause the interference of γ-secretase activity and lead to the increased Aβ 42 secretion.
We aimed to characterize the patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line carrying PS1-S170F mutation.
Furthermore, we tested whether disease-modifying drug can reduce AD pathology in the AD iPSC-derived neurons.
Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated freshly from the peripheral blood of an autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) patient carrying presenilin-1 (PS1) mutation (Ser170Phe; PS1-S170F) and a cognitively normal control.
We generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, which were differentiated into functional cortical neurons.
Then, we measured the markers indicative of AD pathogenesis using immunocytochemistry and Western blot.
We also investigated the mitochondrial dynamics in the AD iPSC-derived neurons using Mito-tracker.
We observed that both extracellular and intracellular Aβ levels were dramatically increased in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with the control iPSC-derived neurons.
Furthermore, PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons showed high expression levels of p-Tau, which were detected both in the soma and neurites.
The mitochondrial velocity in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons was much reduced, compared with that of the control.
We also found a significant decrease of fusion-related protein Mfn1 (membrane proteins mitofusin 1) and an increase of fission-related protein DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1) in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.

| INTRODUC TI ON
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, which is pathologically defined by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates associated with neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex.
tosomal dominant AD (ADAD) is associated with mutations in presenilin-1 (PS1), presenilin-2 (PS2) or amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes.
Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides consist of 38-43 amino acid residues and are generated from APP by beta (β)-and gamma (γ)-secretase-dependent sequential cleavages.
PS1 gene acts as a core component in γ-secretase complex, and the mutations in the PS1 gene interfere with γ-secretase activity, resulting in the increase of Aβ42 secretion.
The S170F in the PS1 gene is a wellknown mutation causing AD at very young age (ie third decade of life) with a rapid progression.
4]
Thus, we speculated that the iPSC-derived neurons from this patient would exhibit AD pathology, including significant defects in mitochondrial and autophagy systems.
Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology provides an excellent method for elucidating the molecular basis of human diseases.
increasing number of studies have employed disease-specific iPSCs in neurological diseases including AD,
1]
Moreover, iPSC-based disease modelling has the great potential towards personalized treatment as each iPSC line is patient-specific and the response of drug treatments can be accurately monitored prior to human treatment.
this study, we generated patient-specific iPSCs from an AD patient carrying PS1-S170F mutation for the first time using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
Then, we aimed to characterize the typical pathological features in the iP-SC-derived neurons from AD patients, compared with the normal control iPSC line which has been fully characterized in our previous study.
We further investigated whether disease-modifying candidate drug can reduce the pathological features of AD iPSC-derived neuron.

| RE SULTS

| Case description
A 29-year-old man visited the memory clinic at Samsung Medical Center for 1 year of progressive memory impairment and visuospatial dysfunction.
He was fired from his work due to serious memory problem and lost his way home from the workplace.
He had 12 years of formal education and did not have any past history of medical problems.
On neurological examination, he showed bradykinesia and tremor on the left side.
On neuropsychological examination, he scored 25 on Mini-mental state examination and showed a severe impairment on visuospatial function, verbal memory and visual memory tests (Table
He had a strong family history of early-onset dementia on his mother's side (Figure
His mother was diagnosed to have dementia in her twenties and died at the age of 29 (Figure
His aunt was also demented in her thirties but did not visit the hospital (Figure
His grandfather was demented as he used to get lost in the neighbourhood in his forties (Figure
In genetic analysis, a known mutation in PSEN1 (p.S170F, c.509C>T) was identified as heterozygous.
The APOE genotype was ε3/ε3.
The patient's brain MRI showed an atrophy in the bilateral parietal areas (Figure

He also developed gait disturbance and action induced myoclonus on the bilateral legs.
Two years later, he entered nursing home as he became fully dependent on basic daily activities and died at the age of 34.
We collected the patient's blood sample when he was 33 years old.
The cognitively normal control showed no atrophy on brain MRI (Figure
His APOE genotype was e3/e4.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center [1044308-201612-BR-031-05].
We obtained a written consent from each participant and his next of kin.

| Generation of an iPSC line from the AD patient carrying PS1-S170F mutation and differentiation into cortical neurons
Isolated MNCs were reprogrammed using Sendai virus vector (SeVdp) which expresses four reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, cMYC and KLF4).
In our iPSC generation procedure, we routinely pick more than three individual clones and select the best growing clone among them for further analyses, including neuronal differentiation experiments.
We generated and characterized a patient-specific iPSC line from the AD patient carrying PS1 mutation (Ser170Phe; PS1-S170F) for the first time (Figure
In this study, we compared the PS1-S170F iPSC line with the normal control iPSC line which has been fully characterized in our previous study.
PS1-S170F patient-derived iPSC line exhibited the typical expression of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cell markers, such as OCT4, SOX2, SSEA4 and TRA-1-81 (Figure
Genotyping of the established iPSC line was confirmed using a conventional sequencing method (Figure
Differentiation potential of iPSC lines was assessed in vitro by three-germ layer marker expression (Figure
To characterize the cortical neurons derived from the iPSC lines, we established the cortical neural differentiation protocols by modifying previous procedures (Figure
(ie TBR1 and CTIP2) (Figure
To examine the functional differences between the control and PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, we used the whole-cell patch clamp to record the differentiated neurons.
All of the differentiated neurons exhibited spontaneous repetitive action potentials (AP) of currents clamp mode at 10-12 weeks after differentiation (Figure
However, there was no significant difference in the amplitude of AP (mV), sodium and potassium current (pA) between two iPSC lines (Figure

| Increased extracellular and intracellular Aβ levels in PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons
To Taken together, we demonstrated that the PS1-S170F patient iP-SC-derived neurons exhibited significant increases in extracellular
Aβ levels from 4 weeks of neuronal differentiation, as well as TBSinsoluble/SDS-soluble intracellular Aβ levels at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.

| Elevated phospho-tau levels in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons
In mature neurons, tau protein normally exists as a soluble form in axons.
However, in AD the tau protein is hyperphosphorylated and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) protein is abnormally accumulated in dendrites and cell bodies.
To detect the p-Tau levels in the iPSCderived neurons, we performed immunocytochemical analysis using antibodies against AT8 (phosphorylated at Ser202/Thr205) and found that PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons exhibited significant increase of AT8 expression in neurites and soma, compared with the control (Figure
Subsequently, we performed Western blot analysis to measure the AT8 and Tau5 (total tau) expression.
We detected the typical bands of AT8 in the fractions from the PS1S170F iPSC-derived neurons, and the AT8 levels (>50 kDa) were strongly increased in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons compare with the control (Figure
These results demonstrated that there are high levels of hyperphosphorylated tau which localizes to the cell bodies in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons compared with the control at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.

| Impaired axonal transport of mitochondria and the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission in the PS1-S170F iPSCderived neurons
Recent studies reported that high levels of Aβ and p-Tau were found to impair axonal transport of mitochondria.
To investigate the mitochondrial dynamics, we performed the live cell imaging using Mitotracker (Ds-Red) at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.
We found that the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons showed a reduced mitochondrial movement, compared with that of the control (Movies S1 and S2).
Kymograph analysis on mitochondria was performed using KymographClear, and the quantification analysis of mitochondria velocity was conducted using KymographDirect (Figure
Both the anterograde and retrograde velocities exhibited a significant decrease in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with the control (Figure
The mitochondrial dynamics is determined by the constant process of fusion and fission, and this process is tightly regulated by the balance of fusion and fission-related proteins.
erefore, we investigated the expression patterns of mitochondrial fusion and fission-related proteins, including mitochondria fusionrelated protein Mfn1 (membrane proteins mitofusin 1), Mfn2 (membrane proteins mitofusin 2), mitochondria fission-related proteins DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1) and Fis1 (mitochondrial fission 1 protein).
Western blot analysis revealed that Mfn1 expression was dramatically reduced in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.
On the other hand, DRP1 expression levels were significantly increased in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with that of the control (Figure
These results strongly suggest that high levels of Aβ and p-Tau may disrupt the mitochondrial transport, through impaired balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.

| Defective autophagy-related clearance in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons
Autophagy is essential for neuronal survival, as it has an important role in degradative pathway for proteins and organelles.
In AD, defective autophagy is evident as the autophagy vacuoles (AVs) are accumulated in the brain tissues of AD patients, which are correlated with the presence of neuritic plaques and filamentous tau.
so, it has been reported that increased autophagy induction and defective clearance of Aβ generating AVs results in Aβ accumulation.
9 Therefore, to investigate whether the autophagosome is also abnormally accumulated in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, we performed immunocytochemical analysis at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation which showed very high levels of Aβ 42 production and p-Tau.
We found that the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons exhibited a dramatic increase of LC3b in the periphery of soma area, compared with the control (Figure
In addition, we measured expression levels of autophagy-related proteins, including Ub (Ubiquitin), p62 (SQSTM1, sequestosome 1; cargo protein marker), Beclin1 (autophagosome membrane formation-related protein), LC3b (light chain 3; autophagosome formation marker), LAMP1
(lysosome-associated membrane protein1) and LAMP2 at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.
Western blot and its quantification analysis revealed that p62, Beclin1 and the canonical autophagosome marker LC3b were significantly increased in the PS1-S170F iPSCderived neurons (Figure
However, there was no change in the lysosomal markers, including LAMP1 and LAMP2 (Figure
Taken together, even if the LC3b-based autophagy system was activated, PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons showed very high levels of Aβ 42 and p-Tau expression, implying that the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons are impaired in autophagy-related clearance system at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.

| D ISCUSS I ON
In an attempt to understand AD pathogenesis, we have established and characterized the patient iPSC line from an AD patient carrying PS1-S170F mutation.
PS1-S170F mutation has been identified in several independent families with very early-onset dementia in the late 20s.
4]
Another autopsy study from a 28-year-old AD patient with PS1 S170F mutation also showed severe Aβ deposition with neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex.
Although we could not obtain brain tissue from our patient, we could assume AD pathology in the patient's brain as he showed PS1-S170F mutation, rapid cognitive decline, family history of early-onset dementia and abnormal neuroimaging findings (cortical atrophy especially in the bilateral parietal areas and hypometabolism in the bilateral temporo-parietal areas).
Although PS1-S170F is a well-known mutation causing familial AD, iPSC generation and characterization results have not been reported previously.
We found that the differentiated neurons exhibited the spontaneous repetitive AP of currents clamp mode at 10-12 weeks after differentiation in all of the iPSC-derived neurons (Figure
These results strongly suggest that the differentiated neurons generated the neuronal signal responses and were matured into functional neurons in vitro at the 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.
We also found that the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons showed a significant increase of extracellular and TBS-insoluble/SDS-soluble intracellular Aβ 42 levels from 4 weeks of neuronal differentiation and exhibited very high levels of Aβ 42 and the ratio of Aβ 42 /Aβ40 at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation (Figure
Previous studies demonstrated that brain tissues from severe Braak stages of AD patients
We also detected the abnormally accumulated p-Tau (AT8) in the cell bodies and multi-bands of AT8 in the fractions (>50 kDa) that may indicate the hyperphosphorylated-tau
In addition, the AT8 levels (>50 kDa), which are maybe related to the localization in the cell bodies were strongly increased in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with the control (Figure
These results support the hypothesis that accumulation of Aβ peptides may result in the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated-tau proteins in the cell bodies.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of AD.
Mitochondria are a highly dynamic organelle, and the intracellular population at any time point is derived from a balance between fission and fusion.
We observed dramatic decrease in movement of Many reports suggest the possibility of defective autophagy in AD.
It has been demonstrated that autophagy vacuoles (AVs) accumulate in human AD brains and are related to the presence of neuritic plaques and filamentous tau.
In this study, we observed significantly increased active forms of LC3b-II in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation (Figure

investigate the Aβ levels in the control and PS1-S170F iPSCderived cortical neurons, we measured Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels secreted from iPSC-derived neurons into the medium (extracellular) at 48 hours after the last medium change from 4 to 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.
No difference was noted in Aβ 40 levels.
However, PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons exhibited a dramatic increase in Aβ 42 levels (over 2-fold) from 4 weeks after differentiation.Importantly, the ratio of Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 was significantly increased (over 2-fold) in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with the control (Figure2A).To detect the Aβ deposits, the iPSC-derived neurons were stained with anti-Aβ 42 antibody at 10 weeks of neuronal differentiation.
Notably, confocal microscopy images showed a robust increase in extracellular Aβ 42 deposits in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with the control (Figure2B).To measure the insoluble Aβ, we extracted TBS-insoluble/SDSsoluble fractions described previously.
TBS-insoluble/SDSsoluble intracellular Aβ 42 and Aβ 40 levels were measured in a total of 1µg proteins using ELISA from 10 weeks of neuronal differentiated cortical neurons.
Levels of the intracellular Aβ 42 and the ratio of Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 showed a significant increase in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.
Surprisingly, we also observed a marked increase of TBS-insoluble Aβ 40 levels in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons, compared with the control (Figure2C).

Reduction of Aβ and p-Tau levels by diseasemodifying drug candidate (BACE1 inhibitor)Aβ is produced by the sequential cleavage of APP by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase.
Therefore, these two enzymes are regarded as the most important targets for candidate drugs of AD, and previous studies have shown the rescue effects on Aβ production when the familial AD patient iPSC-derived neurons were treated with BSI (BACE1 inhibitor).
For candidate drug treatment, we treated the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons with 5 µmol/L LY-2886721, a BACE1 inhibitor, for 5 days after 6 weeks of neuronal differentiation and investigated the effects on Aβ and p-Tau levels (Figure4A).
Importantly, the levels of Aβ 42 and the ratio of Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 were shown to be decreased significantly after LY2884721 treatment (Figure4B-D).
Furthermore, the expression of p-Tau (AT8) was also shown to be decreased dramatically in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons after LY2884721 treatment (Figure4E-G).
These results demonstrate that our PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons are suitable for AD drug screening, and as such, they can serve as a useful resource in the future.

As AD is heterogenous and drug response may vary in each individual, we need a reliable screening system using patient-specific human cells for investigating the therapeutic effects of the candidate drugs on each individual.
Therefore, after we confirmed that PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neuron exhibited the typical AD pathological features, we performed a proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate the suitability of our AD patient-derived iPSC lines for candidate drug screening.
In this study, we selected LY-2886721, a BACE1 inhibitor, to study its effects on Aβ 42 and p-Tau levels.
First of all, levels of Aβ 42 and the ratio of Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 showed a significant decrease after 5 µmol/L of LY2884721 treatment, compared with vehicle (VC) neurons (Figure4B-D).
Interestingly, p-Tau (AT8) also showed a dramatic decrease in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons after LY2884721 treatment (Figure4E-G).
However, there was no significant rescue effect on mitochondria and autophagy dysfunction after LY2884721 treatment (data not shown).
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that, although clinical trials using BACE1 inhibitor have not succeeded yet, the ADAD patients with PS1-S170F might benefit from this drug treatment.In summary, we generated an induced iPSC line from AD patient carrying PS1-S170F mutation and then differentiated them into functional cortical neurons.
We found high levels of extracellular/ intracellular Aβ and p-Tau in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons compare with the control.
We next investigated impaired mitochondrial dynamics and balance of fusion and fission in PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.
Furthermore, we also demonstrated defects of autophagy-related clearance PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.In addition, levels of Aβ and p-Tau exhibited dramatic reduction by LY-2886721 (BACE1 inhibitor) treatment in the PS1-S170F iPSC-derived neurons.
Taken together, we have characterized the pathological features of AD patient carrying mutation for PS1-S170F using iPSC technology and observed a good response to a candidate drug.
