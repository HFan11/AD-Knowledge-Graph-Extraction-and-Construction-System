Porphyromonas Gingivalis as a Risk Factor to Alzheimer’s Disease: A Systematic Review
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for more than 50% of all dementia cases worldwide.
There is wide consensus on the risk factors of AD; however, a clear etiology remains unknown.
Evidence suggests that the inflammatory-mediated disease model, such as that found with periodontal disease due to Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.
gingivalis), plays a role in AD progression.
Objective: This study aims to systematically review the literature on the association between P. gingivalis to AD, and to identify the homogeneity of the methods used across studies to measure P. gingivalis involvement in AD.
Methods: We systematically searched studies on Cochrane library, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, WHOLIS, Google Scholar databases, and reference lists of identified studies.
Results: 6 studies out of 636 identified records fulfilled all eligibility criteria.
Results showed no clear pathophysiology of AD due to P. gingivalis and its various virulence factors.
No consensus was found in the literature pertaining to the method of measurement of AD or P. gingivalis and its virulence factors.
The included studies suggest that P. gingivalis bacteria play a role in the process of systemic inflammation which leads to cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and indirectly cause hastening of AD onset and progression.
Our included studies revealed heterogeneity in the methodologies of measurement of AD and/or P. gingivalis and its virulence factors, which opens discussion about the benefits and weakness of possible standardization.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive chronic neurodegenerative dementing disease
AD is the most common cause of dementia, a broad term that describes memory loss and other cognitive ability impairments serious enough to interfere with a person's daily life.
Women seem to be more susceptible to AD than men
AD is associated with neuronal degeneration and atrophy in the brain leading to death.
In a normal non-AD diagnosed brain, amyloid-␤ (A␤) proteins are found in-and-around the neurons.
However, in AD, these proteins aggregate together and form clusters in the brain, called "amyloid plaques".
Another feature of AD is the abnormal deposits of the tau protein inside degenerating neurons.
It is still unknown whether the plaques are the cause of AD or if they represent the brain's response to neurodegeneration

The complex-multifactorial causes of AD are still unknown
However, there is consensus in the literature that AD is an interaction between genetic and environmental elements, with age considered the main risk factor for AD
AD patients show signs of generalized inflammation and neuronal degeneration that are consistent with bacterial infections.
These signs include complement, inflammasome, and microglial activation as well as altered cytokine profiles
Recently, several studies have discovered periodontal pathogens in the brain and suggested their involvement in ADassociated inflammation
Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.
gingivalis) is a periodontopathic Gram-negative non-motile bacterium that is implicated in periodontal inflammation and periodontitis
P. gingivalis is found in about 86% of subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis
It is also associated with several diseases and conditions, e.g., atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and squamous cell carcinoma due to the complex nature of its virulence factors
The inflammatory nature of P. gingivalis and its virulence factors lead to stimulation of the inflammatory response which causes blood vessel damage
One virulence factor highly associated with periodontal and inflammatory disease progression is gingipains.
Gingipains are enzymes secreted by P. gingivalis that play a significant role in P. gingivalis survival, virulence, host invasion, and colonization
Gingipains play a crucial role in degrading host immune response and tissue damage by the degradation of collagen, which in turn impede wound healing
Olsen and Singhrao explain that this happens through gingipains destroying complement through proteolytic degradation, and by inhibiting complement activation by binding to a complement inhibitor
Moreover, P. gingivalis expression of gingipains also allows its persistence in the periodontal tissue and further complicates its elimination by the immune response
Using tissue microarrays containing matched brain samples, Dominy et al. identified gingipains in the brains of AD patients.
In the study, the levels of gingipains identified were found to be correlated to the extent of AD pathology
Aside from the inflammation caused by P. gingivalis
Recently, P. gingivalis was shown to be present in the periodontium of AD patients
Another cross-sectional study reported finding P. gingivalis intracerebrally in four out of the ten ADdiagnosed brain samples, while none for all non-AD diagnosed brain samples
An inflammatory-mediated model explaining the progression of AD has been described in the literature previously
Innate immune inflammatory activity in the AD brain can result from the deposition of A␤ protein as well as from specific bacterial infections that tend to possess weak immunostimulatory responses
Recently, numerous studies have discussed that periodontal inflammation may result in hastening of AD and/or dementia onset even though the mechanism is unclear
In a large cohort with follow-up of more than 10 years, subjects with periodontal disease were found to have a higher risk of developing AD and dementia
Periodontal disease involvement in AD is further supported in a recent review by Kamer et al. that stated that an increased incidence of AD is evident in patients with periodontal disease
The present study aims to systematically review and analyze the literature on the association between the periodontal pathogen, P. gingivalis, and the dementing condition of AD.
The objectives of the study are to identify the risk of AD associated with P. gingivalis and its virulence factors and to explore the different tools and methods used across studies to measure P. gingivalis involvement in AD.

METHODS
This systematic literature review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines
We applied the following inclusion-exclusion criteria: 1) Original research and studies using human populations and/or human specimens and published in peer-reviewed journals.
Editorials, viewpoints, policy reviews, summaries, or discussion papers were excluded.
2) Studies with control groups.
3) Studies focusing on AD that has been diagnosed using clear definitions and/or criteria.
4) Studies including non-human sources or that focused only on specific populations such as HIV patients or psychiatric patients were excluded.
Two researchers independently conducted the literature search for studies published in English in Cochrane, OVID, PubMed, Web of Science, and WHOlis until 31 August 2020.
The authors also used Google Scholar to search for relevant articles.
We used the following search terms to identify relevant studies: "Porphyromonas gingivalis" and "Alzheimer".
The authors AE and CI screened titleabstract and full texts of the references independently against the inclusion-exclusion criteria.
In cases of disagreement, the issues were discussed among all authors.
We assessed the quality of the included studies by using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Study Quality Assessment Tools
Use of randomization, the calculation of sample sizes, and the size of the unit of allocation impacted the quality assessment score given to the individual studies.
A comparative analysis was done using analytical categories developed based on the methodology used to measure both AD and its progression, and the presence of P. gingivalis and its virulence factors.
These categories were: 1) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) average score of samples, 2) P. gingivalis antibody immunoglobulin (P.
gingivalis Ab IgG) measures, 3) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) measures, 4) P. gingivalis, virulence factor lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or gingipains measures or presence and 5) further analysis.
As for 5), 'further analysis' is for the purpose of this review defined as variables the included-studies' authors have reported to have a possible influence on the relation between AD and P. gingivalis.
Some authors suggest that these variables may have also affected the obtained results or acted as confounders.
We extracted the data using a data extraction sheet pre-designed and pre-tested for the objectives of our study.
Information extracted included study aim, sample size, sampling strategy, statistical measures, and results.

RESULTS

DISCUSSION

Discussion of key findings
Several studies have identified an association between PD and AD; however, the nature of this relation remains unclear
Recent published articles suggest that P. gingivalis, which was recently found in AD-diagnosed brain autopsy specimens, is the link between those two inflammatory conditions
Our study synthesized the evidence on the relationship between P. gingivalis and AD and contrary to hypothesis of direct causation between P. gingivalis and AD, we found that the presence of P. gingivalis virulence factors or antibodies has no proven direct association with AD.
We also found that antibody levels detected in the included studies did not differ significantly between cases and controls.
Moreover, this systematic review found no homogeneity in the methodology used across studies (besides the use of MMSE scale for AD progression).
The results also highlight that there are divergent approaches with regards to P. gingivalis assessment in humans.
Some of the included studies analyzed P. gingivalis AB IgG, yet they employed different threshold values.
Our review also found several inflammatory measures used across the studies that may indicate association between P. gingivalis and AD and in line with the hypothesis of AD being a direct cause of systemic inflammation
This is consistent with recent published literature that suggests that periodontal bacteria and their virulence factors, such as P. gingivalis and gingipains, caused neuronal impairment and inflammatory responses common to the pathological processes found in AD

Risk of AD development due to P. gingivalis exposure
When establishing the risk of AD development due to P. gingivalis and its virulence factors, Ide et al.
This may be deemed contrary to the results found in the study by Sparks Stein et al.
Papapanou et al.
Thus, P. gingivalis AB IgG presence or prevalence may also be indicative of many other factors.
One way to avoid such a drawback is to match participants according to oral condition or baseline P. gingivalis and P. gingivalis AB IgG levels.
Several studies included in our analysis controlled for potential confounders, e.g., Ide et al.
Ide et al.
Kamer et al.
In their study, Poole et al.
As memory typically deteriorates during AD, it may be harder for AD patients to maintain oral hygiene measures, which would also explain poor oral health conditions as AD advances
Our findings suggest that no sufficient evidence in the literature is available that supports the hypothesis of direct connection between AD and P. gingivalis bacteria.
These findings support previous statements by
Regardless of these statements, we still found several inflammatory measures across the studies that may indicate association and in line with the hypothesis of AD being a direct cause of systematic inflammation

Inflammatory process hypothesis
Consistent with our results, other molecular and biological studies also emphasized the importance of inflammatory processes and infectious agents in developing localized inflammation in the brain
This hypothesis is specifically viable after the classification of these plaques as an antimicrobial peptide and an immune response
Other studies have also identified P. gingivalis virulence factor, gingipains, in AD-diagnosed brain samples, where its intracranial levels have been found to be correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology
However, this was not supported by the findings of one of our included studies, by Poole et al.

Oral health status
Recent studies have also investigated the association between periodontal disease such as periodontitis, and P. gingivalis, to AD and several inflammatory diseases
One of those studies conducted on the Nun Study, a continuing longitudinal study that examines the onset of AD
By exclusively examining the risk of AD associated with the periodontal pathogen, P. gingivalis, and its virulence factors in humans, this study provides a recent and comprehensive analysis of available evidence.
Oral health measures were not fully explained in all studies included in this review.
Several studies reported higher incidences of AD in participants with deteriorating oral health
Some authors suggest that inflammatory processes due to oral health infections cause immune system activation and release of cytokines in the bloodstream.
The theory adds that some of these changes affect the permeability of the blood-brain barrier.
This, the studies propose, leads to the passage of P. gingivalis virulence factors into the central nervous system.
These factors then lead to plaque formation as a defensive mechanism in the brain
Some longitudinal studies have shown a significant association between AD and poor oral health
Whether the relationship is causal remains a question.
Including the oral health status and parameters when investigating oral pathogens rather than merely focusing on specific bacteria, such as P. gingivalis, may provide the sought-after results regarding AD pathophysiology and diagnosis.

Sample characteristics
Our analysis found that age and gender are of high relevance when researching AD.
This is due to AD being a disease that commonly appears in the elderly population
Studies also show that AD is more prevalent in females than males
We found that race is also seen as a risk factor for AD.
According to a survey by Mayeda et al. in 2016, AD was found most prevalent in the Black race, followed by Hispanics, and then Caucasians

Apolipoprotein ε4
Evidence in literature shows that one risk factor linked to increased incidence and earlier onset of AD is presence of apolipoprotein APOE ε4
Three of our included studies have mentioned performing APOE genotyping to their samples and only one, by Sparks Stein et al.
Although not reported in their study and mentioned in a subsequent by Siddiqui et al.

Limitations
Several limitations might have influenced the results obtained in our study.
We included studies published only in the English language and therefore may have missed relevant articles published in other languages.
All included studies were conducted either in the USA, the UK, or Germany demonstrating lacking evidence from other regions.
Most of the included studies applied hospital-based and community-based sample selection methods; this may also lead to bias.
Due to the high degree of subjectivity and different tools used to measure and diagnose AD in the included studies, we were not able to perform a formal meta-analysis.
Furthermore, AD diagnosis requires demonstrated amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, either post-mortem or by a positron emission tomography examination, along with the presence of the clinical signs, which were not mentioned in the diagnosis criteria used for the AD cases in the studies included in this review
Standardized diagnostic measures for AD would allow for better comparability across studies.
Lastly, human error and subjected bias cannot be omitted.

CONCLUSION
This study analyzed available literature on the association between P. gingivalis bacteria and AD and its progression.
Our findings show insufficient data to evaluate the association between P. gingivalis and AD and its development.
However, all included studies suggest the probability of P. gingivalis bacteria, especially through its virulence factors, in playing a role in the process of systematic inflammation.
Moreover, our results show a lack of homogeneity in AD and P. gingivalis diagnosis and measuring across the included studies.
