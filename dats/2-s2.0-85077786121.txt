Human and mouse single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal TREM2-dependent and TREM2-independent cellular responses in Alzheimer’s disease
U. processed the mouse brains to generate single nuclei.
Y.Z. and A.S. processed human post-mortem tissues to generate single nuclei
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia.
Pathologically, amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides produced by neurons form extracellular aggregates that initiate disease; intraneuronal tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation ensue, causing neuronal and synaptic dysfunction and cell death
Reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis are secondary cellular responses to pathology that occur in diseased brain regions
A slew of -omics studies in recent years has yielded complementary snapshots of glial responses to pathology in the AD brain
These studies have largely concluded that microglia undergo the most prominent changes in diseased brains, due to a combination of increased microglia numbers along with a robust transcriptional activation signature on a per-microglia basis.
Such activated microglia, which have been referred to as diseaseassociated microglia (DAM), has a transcriptional signature quite distinct from that of homeostatic microglia that markedly declines in mouse models of AD
Studies of genetic risk for sporadic AD have suggested that microglia not only respond to disease but modulate disease course
Most notably, a hypomorphic variant in the microglial receptor TREM2, R47H, increases the risk of AD several fold, as do other TREM2 variants, such as R62H, although with reduced penetrance
Mechanistically, loss of TREM2 function in AD mouse models restricts the ability of microglia to surround Aβ plaques
These findings suggest that changes in the AD brain are a combination of direct Aβ-mediated pathology and secondary responses by TREM2dependent activated microglia.
Methods to study single nuclei have recently been developed, enabling transcriptomic analysis of essentially all brain cell types 20,
Single nuclei analysis of human AD brain specimens has revealed a microglial transcriptional response that partially recapitulates the mouse DAM signature along with perturbation of oligodendrocytes and myelination that is gender-dependent
Nonetheless, little is known about how TREM2-dependent microglial functions impact the AD brain as a whole.
In this study, we comprehensively surveyed transcriptional changes associated with AD pathology and TREM2 deficit in brains from 5XFAD mice undergoing Aβ accumulation
We found that transcriptional signatures of the human AD response identified in microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were remarkably different from those observed in mice.
However, AD patients carrying the R47H and, to a minor extent, the R62H variant of TREM2 showed a defective microglial transcriptional activation, demonstrating that TREM2 impacts microglia function in both a mouse model of Aβ accumulation and human AD.

Results

snRNA-seq reveals a Trem2-dependent microgliosis at early stages of Aβ accumulation
To investigate the impact of Aβ and microglial activation across cell types in mouse, we performed snRNA-seq on 7-month-old 5XFAD, Trem2-deficient 5XFAD (Trem2 -/-5XFAD), wild-type (WT), and Trem2 -/-mice (3 mice/genotype) (Fig.
A total of 73,419 individual nuclei were arranged by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) in two dimensions for visualization.
Unsupervised clustering revealed a total of 11 distinct clusters across all samples (Fig.
These clusters were manually identified based on expression of known cell-type specific markers (Fig.
Containing few nuclei, Cluster 10 could not be assigned and was omitted from further analyses.
For all four genotypes, all clusters were similarly represented in each of the 3 mice analyzed and most nuclei had similar numbers of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (Fig.
Notably, the microglia cluster was much larger in the 5XFAD cortex than in the Trem2 -/-5XFAD and non-5XFAD cortices (Fig.
We also surveyed 15-month-old mice with an advanced stage of pathology by snRNA-seq of nuclei pooled from the cortices or the hippocampi of 3 mice per genotype (Extended Data Fig.
Most clusters were similarly represented in all samples, with the exception of certain neuron clusters overrepresented in the cortex or in the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig.
Interestingly, the difference between microglial clusters in 5XFAD and Trem2 -/-5XFAD cortices was minimal at this stage (Extended Data Fig.
Moreover, we noticed that the Trem2 -/-5XFAD cortex contained a neuronal cluster with significantly fewer UMIs but relatively high expression of peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (Pam) (Extended Data Fig.

DAM signature is Trem2-dependent at early and late stages of Aβ accumulation
We next focused on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on a per-cluster basis, specifically comparing 5XFAD vs. WT (Aβ effects) and 5XFAD vs. Trem2 -/-5XFAD (Trem2 dependence) in both 7-month-old (Fig.
We first performed a detailed analysis of microglia-specific changes.
DAM genes, including Cst7, Csf1, Apoe, Trem2, Lpl, Lilrb4a, MHC-I (H2-d1), MHC-II (Cd74), and various cathepsin genes were notably upregulated in 5XFAD compared to WT mice.
Homeostatic genes, such as P2ry12, Selplg, Tmem119, and Cx3cr1 were downregulated.
These results were highly concordant between the 7-month-and 15-month-old datasets (Fig.
Furthermore, we found significantly higher expression of Cst7, Csf1, MHC-I (H2-K and b2m), among other genes, in 5XFAD than in Trem2 -/-5XFAD microglia, recapitulating the Trem2-dependent upregulation of these genes reported in the literature.
Taking advantage of the single-cell resolution of our data, we re-clustered microglia of 7-month-old mice to distinguish 4 sub-clusters (Fig.
Of these, sub-cluster 1 was highly represented in 5XFAD mice, less so in Trem2 -/-5XFAD mice and barely detectable in WT and Trem2 -/- mice (Fig.
This sub-cluster specifically expressed DAM genes (Fig.
Similarly, re-clustering of microglia from 15month-old mice revealed that one distinct sub-cluster was exclusively represented in 5XFAD mice and enriched in DAM genes (Extended Data Fig.
These findings demonstrate that our analysis pipeline is robust enough to discern the major transcriptional features of Aβ-and TREM2-induced microglia activation.

snRNA-seq reveals an Aβ-dependent oligodendrocyte reactive signature
We next examined oligodendrocytes, OPCs, astrocytes, and neuronal subsets in 7-and 15month-old mice.
Oligodendrocytes harbored the most strikingly upregulated genes.
Volcano plot of 5XFAD vs WT oligodendrocytes in 7-month-old mice revealed a significant upregulation of three genes in particular -the complement component C4b, the serine protease inhibitor Serpina3n, and MHC-I (H2-D1) -in 5XFAD brains (Fig.
Increased expression of C4b and Serpina3n was partially dependent on Trem2 in 7-month-old (Extended Data Fig.
Corroborating this conclusion, an oligodendrocyte cell line upregulated C4 when exposed to Aβ, as well as alpha-2-macroglobulin and cytokines known to be released by microglia (Extended Data Fig.
Next, we validated the oligodendrocyte Aβ-associated signature at the protein-level by immunofluorescence (IF).
5XFAD brains contained more Olig2 + nuclei indicative of oligodendrocyte lineage cells than did non-5XFAD brains (Fig.
However, no enrichment of oligodendrocytes adjacent to plaques was observed (Extended Data Fig.
Co-staining for either Serpina3n or C4b along with nuclear Olig2 showed perinuclear expression of Serpina3n and C4b in oligodendrocyte lineage cells of 5XFAD and Trem2 -/-5XFAD brains (Fig.
These Aβ-reactive Serpina3n + Olig2 + cells were markedly enriched in plaque-bearing brain regions (Fig.
The increase in oligodendrocytes that express Serpina3n in 5XFAD brains was confirmed by staining with CA2 as an alternative oligodendrocyte marker (Extended Data Fig.
We also detected little colocalization of Serpina3n with astrocytes (Extended Data Fig.
What is the impact of C4b and Serpina3n secretion by oligodendrocytes?
Given that formation of Aβ plaques is increased in mice transgenic for Serpina3n
We found that addition of C4b to Aβ42 peptides strongly accelerated aggregation of Aβ; Serpina3n alone modestly promoted aggregation at high Aβ42 concentrations and did not synergize with C4b (Extended Data Fig.
Altogether, these results demonstrate that Aβ accumulation in mice is paralleled by an increase in the number and reactive state of oligodendrocytes that may be partially dependent on TREM2, at least at early stages of disease.
Reactive oligodendrocytes secrete C4b and Serpina3n, which may facilitate Aβ aggregation.

Transcriptional changes in neuronal and other non-neuronal populations in response to

Aβ are minimal
Cell types other than microglia and oligodendrocytes evinced more limited transcriptional responses to Aβ. OPCs strongly upregulated C4b, with a fold change and p-value similar to oligodendrocyte activation genes (Extended Data Fig.
Astrocytes upregulated Gfap and C4b, but to a lesser extent than did oligodendrocytes (Extended Data Fig.
Egr1, a transcriptional regulator that mediates cell survival and proliferation, was substantially downregulated in excitatory neuron clusters (Extended Data Fig.
In addition to genes with known connections to AD, we identified scores of additional genes that are moderately upregulated in the 5XFAD model in various cell types (Extended Data Fig.
We conclude that the impact of Aβ beyond microglia and oligodendrocytes is limited.

Bulk proteomic analysis validates Trem2-dependent and -independent activation genes at the protein level
To validate Aβ and TREM2 effects on the murine brain using an independent modality, we employed quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics of whole brain tissue from 10month-old 5XFAD mice that were Trem2-deficient or expressed either the common variant (CV) (CV-5XFAD) or the R47H hypomorphic variant (R47H-5XFAD) of human TREM2 instead of endogenous Trem2
Proteomic analysis yielded a list of proteins more abundant in CV-5XFAD than in CV brains that were largely concordant with genes identified by snRNA-seq, but with a significant number of additions (Extended Data Fig.
For example, proteins such as the neurotrophic factor Midkine 25 , were found to be highly upregulated, despite being unchanged in our snRNA-seq analysis.
To ascertain the cell type of origin for upregulated proteins identified by proteomic analysis, we linked them to our per-cluster average expression data from snRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig.
The majority of upregulated proteins were most highly expressed in microglia.
However, genes expressed by oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells were also substantially represented at the protein level (Extended Data Fig.
Of special note, Serpina3n and C4b were among the top 20 most upregulated proteins, validating these as important activation markers.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the most highly upregulated proteins identified immune pathways overwhelmingly as the most significant in this regard (Extended Data Fig.
The majority of microglia-expressed proteins were less abundant in Trem2 -/-5XFAD and R47H-5XFAD brains than in CV-5XFAD brains.
In addition to total proteins, we also analyzed phosphorylation from the same samples.
Interestingly, phosphopeptides that increased most dramatically from CV to CV-5XFAD generally did not originate from proteins with the greatest total-level changes, with the exception of Spp1, which was in the top 20 phosphopeptides.
As done for proteomics analysis, we matched cluster-by-cluster expression in snRNA-seq for the genes corresponding to each phosphopeptide (Extended Data Fig.
Upregulated phosphopeptides were more typically expressed in neuronal than in glial populations.
IPA pathway analysis of the most upregulated phosphopeptides identified synaptic signaling pathways as the most significantly upregulated in CV-5XFAD mice compared to CV mice (Extended Data Fig.
We speculate that protein phosphorylation is a response to AD pathology that occurs more prominently in neurons than in glial cells.

Human brain AD gene signatures are distinct from those of the 5XFAD model
We sought to verify key findings observed in the mouse model in human AD.
We performed snRNA-seq of post-mortem samples of dorsolateral pre-frontal cortexes from 11 AD patients with the common variant (CV) of TREM2, 10 AD patients bearing the TREM2 R62H variant, and 11 controls, all obtained from the Rush AD center (Supplementary Table
We analyzed a total of 66,311 individual nuclei with a median of 1,312 genes per nucleus, which were visualized in two dimensions by t-SNE (Fig.
Most samples had a median of over 2,000 UMIs per nucleus (Extended Data Fig.
Unsupervised clustering revealed a total of 10 distinct clusters across all samples, which were manually assigned based on expression of known cell-type specific markers (Extended Data Fig.
The smallest cluster could not be assigned and was omitted from further analyses.
We identified oligodendrocyte (Oli0 and Oli1), excitatory neuron (Ex0 and Ex1), inhibitory neuron (In), astrocyte (Astro), microglia (Micro), OPCs and endothelial cell (Endo) clusters (Fig.
Most clusters were represented similarly in AD and control samples (Fig.
However, the neuronal clusters, especially that enriched for neurofilament genes NEFL and NEFM (Ex1), were underrepresented in AD compared to control samples (Fig.
On the other hand, the proportion of astrocytes was increased in AD compared to control samples, indicating reactive astrocytosis (Fig.
Nuclei distribution of TREM2 R62H AD samples was more similar to TREM2 CV AD than to controls.
We next identified DEGs of each cluster in AD with TREM2 CV compared with controls (Supplementary Table
Top DEGs for each cluster were plotted into a heatmap (Extended Data Fig.
Consistent with neuronal loss in AD, we observed downregulation of many neuronal genes, albeit with a fold change less than 1.5 (Supplementary Table
Nonneuronal populations, including microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, evinced more substantial changes.
In the microglia cluster, genes normally considered as 'homeostatic" in mouse (TMEM119, P2RY12, CX3CR1) were, in fact, notably upregulated in AD compared to controls (Fig.
This signature was remarkably similar to the IRF8-driven reactive phenotype that mouse microglia adopt in peripheral nerve injury (PNI)
Other genes previously reported to be upregulated in human AD but not as part of the DAM signature, including SORL1, A2M, and CHI3L1, were also highly upregulated (Fig.
Noteworthy, SORL1 polymorphisms have been linked to susceptibility to AD
MHCII, TREM2, CD68, and APOE were among the few DAM gene homologues upregulated in human AD samples compared to controls (Extended Data Fig.
Other DAM gene homologues were either similarly expressed in AD and control samples (TYROBP), not detected (CST7, GPNMB, LPL), or even downregulated (SPP1) in human AD microglia (Extended Data Fig.
Finally, AD microglia expressed fewer transcripts of genes involved in iron and divalent metal ion transport (SLC25A37) and storage (HAMP, FTH1) (Fig.
Accordingly, gene ontology (GO) analysis identified metal ion homeostasis as the top pathway downregulated in microglia (Fig.
Interestingly, altered iron homeostasis has been associated with senescence
IF and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses corroborated increased expression of IRF8 in AD versus control samples, together with other markers indicative of microglial responses to Aβ, such as Iba1, CD68, and HLA-DR (Fig.
To further substantiate the contribution of IRF8 in driving the AD-related upregulation of "homeostatic" markers, we showed that overexpression of Irf8 in mouse microglia-like cell cultures upregulated the expression of P2RY12, which was conversely reduced in Irf8 -/-cells (Fig.
To determine whether a distinct AD-associated microglia subpopulation similar to mouse DAM exists in human AD brain, we re-clustered all microglia nuclei into 7 sub-clusters (Micro0-6) (Fig.
Of these, sub-cluster Micro0 was highly enriched for expression of AD reactive genes (Fig.
Similar to the DAM signature, which becomes detectable in WT mice during aging, this human AD-associated signature was present in aged controls, and highly upregulated during disease.
Altogether, these data suggest that the signature of human microglia in AD is quite distinct from that of DAM in the 5XFAD model

The astrocyte signature indicates increase in glial scaring and loss of metabolic coordination between neurons and astrocytes
We noticed that a subpopulation of astrocytes evident in controls was not present in AD (Extended Data Fig.
By re-clustering all of the astrocyte nuclei, we demarcated 6 subclusters (Astro0-5) of astrocytes and confirmed the contraction of Astro3 in AD samples (Fig.
This sub-cluster was highly enriched for genes down-regulated in AD astrocytes (Fig.
Collectively, these genes have been implicated in the coordination of lipid and oxidative metabolism between neurons and astrocytes
AD astrocytes also had elevated expression of genes encoding the proteoglycan NCAN and collagen COL5A3, which were enriched in Astro0 and Astro1 (Fig.
These extracellular matrix molecules may contribute to glial scarring, probably preventing axonal regeneration 31 .
Notably, NCAN polymorphisms have been associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and major depression
Overall, the AD astrocyte profile was quite different from that of A1 astrocytes induced by inflammatory mediators released by microglia

AD-reactive oligodendrocytes reflect functional and metabolic adaptation to axonal degeneration
A heatmap of oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression in AD versus controls revealed significant downregulation of genes that promote myelination through modification of the actin cytoskeleton, such as Stathmin 4 (STMN4)
On the other hand, oligodendrocytes upregulated the expression of genes controlling pH and electrolytes (CA2), osmotic imbalance (SLC38A2), lipid accumulation (MID1IP1) and oxidative stress (SEPP1) (Fig.
Expression of these genes may facilitate metabolic responses to the accumulation of degradation products derived from axonal degeneration.
Changes in gene expression were detected in distinct subpopulations of oligodendrocytes identifiable after re-clustering (Fig.
Upregulated genes, such as CA2, marked sub-cluster Oligo3, while downregulated genes such as MIR219A2, delineated clusters Oligo1 and Oligo2.
The human homologues of mouse Serpina3n and C4b, SERPINA3 and C4B, which were upregulated in reactive oligodendrocytes in the 5XFAD model, were predominantly expressed in astrocytes rather than oligodendrocytes in the human brain (Fig.
Taken together, we characterized an AD-associated signature in microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that is quite distinct from the AD signature identified in mouse Aβ models.
Interestingly, genes enriched in Oligo1 and Micro1 (down-regulated in AD) corresponded to genes previously identified as downregulated during human aging and early onset AD patients from public datasets (Extended Data Fig.
Consistently, genes enriched in Micro0 and Oligo0 (upregulated in AD) correlated with upregulation during aging and early onset AD, further supporting our findings.

Whole brain nCounter mRNA analysis corroborates AD glial signatures and verifies neuronal loss
We next analyzed the same Rush cohort samples using a NanoString neuropathology gene expression panel that does not require gene amplification (Extended Data Fig.
As this analysis was performed on bulk brain specimens, we verified the cell type of origin of each DEG by mapping them onto our human brain nuclei t-SNE plot (Extended Data Fig.
NanoString data confirmed increased expression of microglia IRF8, and oligodendrocyte CA2 in AD compared to controls (Fig.
Moreover, these data exposed diminished expression of genes encoding for neurotrophic factors (BDNF), neurotransmitters (ADCYAP1), molecules involved in axon guidance (PLXNC1), plasticity (ARC)
Notably, reduced ADCYAP1 in human CSF and brain specimens has been associated with cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment due to AD
NanoString analysis on a different set of samples from the occipital cortex of AD patients and age-matched controls derived from the Niigata Brain Research Institute (BRI) (Extended Data Fig.
Moreover, reduced expression of genes encoding neurotransmitters (VIP), stress hormones (CRH), as well as molecules involved in plasticity (CAMK2G), actinbundling (PLS1), and metabolism (CYCS) of neurons was seen in AD samples compared to controls (Extended Data Fig.
Pathway analysis documented an increase in activated microglia and neuronal functional pathways in both the BRI and Rush cohorts (Extended Data Fig.
It is noteworthy that gene signatures indicative of glial responses and neuronal depletion detected by NanoString in the Rush and the BRI cohorts differed somewhat between the two sets of specimens, likely reflecting differences in the transcriptional and functional profiles of glia and neurons in prefrontal and occipital cortices, respectively.

Brain signatures of AD carrying TREM2 variants demonstrate reduced microglial response
Finally, we examined the impact of rare human TREM2 variants on AD signatures.
We first analyzed 10 pre-frontal cortex samples from Rush cohort derived from AD patients carrying the R62H TREM2 variant, which is associated with a 1-2-fold increase in the risk of developing AD.
Overall, AD patients carrying R62H and those carrying CV TREM2 had very similar transcriptional profiles, as seen by t-SNE plot (Fig.
AD R62H carriers clustered more closely with AD CV carriers than with controls, especially within the nonneuronal clusters (Fig.
All AD patients, R62H carriers and CV carriers, had similar numbers of microglia.
However, some microglial AD-reactive genes were downregulated in AD R62H carriers (TREM2, HLA-DRA and CHI3L1) (Fig.
Expression of AD-reactive oligodendrocyte genes was lower in AD R62H carriers than in AD CV carriers, yet was significantly higher in AD R62H carriers than in controls (Fig.
Conversely, not much difference was seen in astrocytes when comparing R62H to CV samples (Fig.
Validating the snRNA-seq data, NanoString analysis corroborated a mild reduction in expression of microglial genes such as TMEM119, IL10RA and HPGDS in the R62H samples compared to CV AD samples (Fig.
We next examined AD patients carrying the R47H variant, who have a higher risk (2-4-fold) of developing AD than do R62H carriers.
Since the Rush cohort included only two of these cases, we chose a different set of human AD brain samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (ADRC), which included parietal cortical tissues from 5 AD patients carrying the R47H variant together with 5 matched specimens from AD patients without TREM2 variants (Supplementary Table
NanoString nCounter mRNA analyses documented a marked decrease in the expression of several microglia genes, including IRF8, HLA-DRA, and AIF1, in the R47H samples (Fig.
According to pathway analysis, R47H brains also had elevated expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and lipid metabolism, along with decreased expression of genes involved in autophagy, growth factor signaling, and neural connectivity (Fig.
Overall, the R47H variant seems to have a greater impact than the R62H variant on microglial response to AD pathology, consistent with the relatively higher penetrance of the R47H variant for AD.

Discussion
Our multi-pronged analyses of AD pathology in both mouse and human brains demonstrates a remarkable discordance between the transcriptional signatures indicative of cellular responses in human AD and those seen in the 5XFAD mouse model of Aβ accumulation.
In mice accumulating Aβ, microglia swap their "homeostatic" signature with a DAM signature that is partially Trem2-dependent
During human AD, microglia acquire a quite distinct signature characterized by increased expression of "homeostatic" genes (TMEM119, CX3CR1, P2RY12) along with genes absent in the DAM signature, such as A2M, CHI3L1 and IRF8.
This signature evokes the reactive microglia phenotype described in a mouse model of PNI that is driven, at least in part, by IRF8
We validated IRF8 expression in human AD microglia by NanoString and IF and showed that IRF8 drives the expression of microglial markers linked to AD, suggesting that IRF8 is likely a major driver of this signature.
Astrocyte signatures also markedly differed between the mouse model and human AD.
In the 5XFAD model, astrocytes assumed a very modest Aβ-dependent signature marked by expression of Gfap.
In human AD, we noted clear contraction of a subset expressing a metabolic signature indicative of lipid uptake, storage, oxidation and detoxification, likely reflecting loss of metabolic coordination between neurons and astrocytes.
Neuronal loss in AD may dampen the need for astrocytic scavenger functions devoted to disposal of neuronal toxic waste.
In parallel, astrocytes upregulated a signature indicative of extracellular matrix protein synthesis related to glial scarring.
In human AD, oligodendrocytes expressed fewer transcripts of genes controlling axonal myelination through axon guidance (SEMA3B), rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton (STMN4) and maturation of myelin-forming cells (MIR219A2).
These functions may no longer be elicited due to neuronal loss and axonal degeneration.
In parallel, oligodendrocytes elevated expression of genes sensitive to changes in pH and electrolytes (CA2), osmotic imbalance (SLC38A2), lipid accumulation (MID1IP1), and oxidative stress (SEPP1), which may be indicate a response to accumulation of degradation products derived from axonal degeneration.
These oligodendrocyte signatures are distinct from those recently associated with multiple sclerosis
In the 5XFAD model, oligodendrocytes adopted a reactive signature including C4b and Serpina3n that was not evident in human AD samples, although both transcripts were detected in human astrocytes.
Moreover, C4b was particularly effective in inducing Aβ aggregation in vitro.
Together these data expand previous studies in mouse models of Aβ aggregation suggesting a pathogenic role for C4b and Serpina3n
In neuronal populations, human AD samples showed diminished expression of genes controlling neurotransmission (ADCYAP1), plasticity (ARC), synaptic vesicles (ATP6V1G2), ion channels (RIMS1), and axon guidance (PLXNC1).
Defects in some of these molecules have been implicated in impaired memory
A clear reduction in the expression of genes controlling memory networks was not evident in the 5XFAD mouse model, in which neuronal pathology is limited to neurite dystrophy.
This difference may help explain the considerable disparity between human and mouse signatures of reactive glial cells.
Our human data are partially concordant with a recent study examining human AD and control samples by snRNA-seq 20 .
Several cell type-specific upregulated genes identified by Mathys et al., including MHC class II and APOE in microglia and QDPR, CA2, and SLC38A2 in oligodendrocytes, were also upregulated in our AD samples.
We also distinguish additional genes upregulated in AD, a novel astrocyte cluster depleted in AD, upregulation of certain "homeostatic" microglia genes, and a potential role for IRF8 in microglia reactivity.
Some of these transcriptional changes correspond to protein changes previously detected in the CSF as AD biomarkers (see Supplementary Table
Importantly, we documented a measurable impact of the human R47H and R62H variants on microglia responses, while astrocyte and oligodendrocyte reactive signatures were not obviously affected.
Notably, NanoString analysis revealed that the precise glial and neuronal gene signatures varied slightly between the three distinct cohorts analyzed, reflecting disparate demographics and/or differing regions of the brain from which the samples were obtained.
Future snRNA-seq studies examining different cohorts and brain regions may shed further light on the spectrum of AD-related transcriptional changes.

Isolation of nuclei from frozen brain tissue
Flash frozen brain tissue was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.025% NP-40), and incubated on ice 15 minutes.
The suspension was filtered through a 30 μm filter to remove debris and pelleted at 500 x g 5 min at 4° C. Nuclei were washed and filtered twice with Nuclei Wash (1% BSA in PBS with 0.2 U/μL RNasin (Promega)).
Nuclei pellets were resuspended in 500 μL Nuclei Wash and 900 uL 1.8 M Sucrose.
This 1400 μL mixture was carefully layered on top of 500 μL 1.8 M sucrose and centrifuged at 13,000 x g 45 min 4 o C to separate the nuclei from myelin debris.
The nuclei pellet was resuspended in Nuclei wash at 1000 nuclei/μL and filtered through a 40 μm FlowMi Cell Strainer.

Isolated mouse nuclei from 15-month-old cohort were subjected to droplet-based 3' end massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits as per manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics).
The libraries were sequenced using Illumina sequencers at the McDonnell Genome Institute.
Sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell counting was performed using the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics).
Cellranger count was used to align samples to the reference genome (mm10, hg38), quantify reads, and filter reads with a quality score below 30.
Processing data with Seurat package and quality control-The Seurat package in R was used for subsequent analysis
For quality control, nuclei with mitochondrial content greater than 5 percent were removed.
Nuclei that are duplets or multiplets were filtered out by two steps.
First, nuclei with more than one marker gene expressed were removed.
Then cells with high UMI and gene number per cell were filtered out.
Cutoffs for UMI and gene number were determined based on histograms showing cell density as a function of UMI/ gene counts.
For 7-month-old mouse brain snRNA-seq analysis, a cutoff of 300-9,000 UMI, 300-5,600 Gene was applied.
After filtering, a total of 73,419 individual nuclei across all genotypes were remained, with a median of 3,941 UMIs and 2,378 genes per nucleus for downstream analysis.
For human brain snRNA-seq, a cutoff of 400-20,000 UMI, 400-7,000 Gene was applied.
After filtering, 66,311 nuclei were remained across 11 AD (CV), 10 AD (R62H) and 11 control samples, with a median of 1,951 UMIs and 1,312 genes per nucleus for downstream analysis.
For 15-month-old mouse brain snRNA-seq analysis, genes expressed in fewer than 3 nuclei and nuclei that expressed less than 400 or greater than 3500 genes were removed for downstream analysis.
After filtering, 38,230 nuclei were remained.
Data was normalized using a scaling factor of 10,000, and nUMI was regressed with a negative binomial model.
Principal component analysis was performed using the top 3000 most variable genes and t-SNE analysis was performed with the top 20 PCAs.
Clustering was performed using a resolution of 0.6.
Clustering and finding markers-Principal component analysis was performed prior to clustering and the first 10 PC's were used based on the ElbowPlot.
Clustering was performed using the FindClusters function which works on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph model with the granularity ranging from 0.1-0.9 and selected 0.2 for the downstream clustering.
For identifying the markers for each cluster, we performed differential expression of each cluster against all other clusters identifying negative and positive markers for that cluster.
Nuclei from broad cell types (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes clusters) were taken and re-clustered to further analyze the sub-clusters in each cell type.

Analysis of gene differential expression
Differential expression of genes between conditions was done using the MAST algorithm
Log 2 (fold change) of average expression and the percentage of cells (pct) expressing the genes in each condition were generated.
For the mouse snRNA-seq analyses, to facilitate data interpretation, changes in frequency of cells were taken into account.
The bulk fold change was calculated by adding log 2 (pct1+0.005)/(pct2+0.005) to the log 2 (FC) generated from the Seurat Package.
Adjusted p-value was calculated based on Bonferroni correction.
Lists of mouse DEGs were generated by filtering all genes for fold change>1.5,
adjusted p-value<0.05.
The lists were ordered by adjusted p-value (Supplementary Table
For the human snRNA-seq analysis, lists of DEGs in non-neuronal clusters were generated by filtering genes for log 2 (fold change)>0.5,
p-value<0.05.
These gene lists were used as inputs for downstream sub-clustering analyses.
Lists of human DEGs in neuronal clusters were generated by filtering all genes for p-value<0.05.
The lists were ordered by fold changes (Supplementary Table

Comparing marker genes with the public datasets
Public datasets GSE53890 and GSE39420 were processed and analyzed in the Phantasus tool (
The top 12,000 genes ranked by average gene expression were selected for differential expression analysis using the LIMMA package.
Differential Expression was performed between samples with age less than 40 and greater than 80, and between controls and early onset Alzheimer's patients, respectively.
Gene set enrichment analysis was then performed using the marker genes from oligodendrocyte and microglia sub-clusters as inputs.

NanoString nCounter analysis
RNA from post-mortem frozen samples was extracted with Qiagen RNeasy Kit and sent for NanoString nCounter analysis
Briefly, RNA is directly tagged with a capture probe and a reporter probe specific to the genes of interest.
After hybridization, the probe-target complexes are immobilized on an imaging surface, which are then scanned by fluorescence microscope and labeled barcodes are counted.
Gene expression analysis was performed on the nCounter system (NanoString Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions and analyzed using nSolver analysis software (NanoString Technologies) and built in statistical analyses.

Immunofluorescence
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused with ice-cold PBS containing 1 U/ml of heparin.
Right brain hemispheres were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, rinsed in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose before freezing in a 2:1 mixture of 30% sucrose and optimal cutting temperature compound.
Serial 40 μm coronal floating sections were cut on a Cryostat (Leica CM1860) and kept in cryoprotectant (30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, PBS).
Floating sections were blocked with 3% BSA and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with anti-Iba-1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:5,000; Wako; or goat polyclonal, 1:1,000; Abcam), anti-Olig2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500; Millipore; or goat polyclonal, 1:500; R&D Systems), anti-mSerpin A3N (goat polyclonal, 1:100; R&D Systems), anti-C4 (rat IgG2a, 1:25; Invitrogen), and/or anti-CA2 (rat IgG2a, 1:200; R&D Systems) overnight at 4°C followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488 labeled anti-GFAP (1:1,000; eBioscience), anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:2,000; Abcam), anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (goat polyclonal, 1:2,000; Invitrogen), anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (goat polyclonal, 1:2,000; Invitrogen), methoxy-X04 (3 μg/ml; Tocris), and/or TO-PRO-3 iodide (300 nM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature.
Serpina3n and CA2 staining was performed with antigen retrieval, preceding blocking, in 10mM sodium citrate buffer with 0.05% Tween-20, at 85°C for 30 minutes.
All antibodies were used in blocking buffer, and between all incubations, sections were washed for 10 min in PBS three times.
Images were collected using a Nikon A1Rsi+ confocal microscope.
Three-dimensional image segmentation of microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, plaques, and neurons, and extraction of parameters were performed in Imaris 8.1 (Bitplane), and further processing was performed using automated scripts in Matlab (Mathworks).
For human IRF8 staining, PPFE sections from Rush AD center were de-paraffinized, rehydrated and boiled in 1mM citrate buffer (pH=6) for 10min for antigen retrieval.
Sections were then blocked with 1% BSA and 0.03% Triton-X in TBST.
anti-IRF8 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:50, Atlas) and anti-Iba1 (goat polyclonal, 1:200; Abcam) were incubated with sections overnight at 4°C in 0.3% BSA, followed by anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (1:1,000; Abcam) and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (goat polyclonal, 1:1,000; Invitrogen) for 50min at room temperature.
Between all incubations, sections were washed for 5min in TBST three times.
Sections were mounted with DAPI.

Immunohistochemistry
Histological diagnosis was revised and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded representative sections for each patient were selected based on adequate tissue preservation as assayed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and subjected to IHC.
Briefly, 20μm thick paraffin embedded representative tissue sections were de-waxed, rehydrated and endogenous peroxidase activity blocked with 0,3% H2O2 in methanol for 20min.
Antigen retrieval was performed by using a microwave-oven in 1mM Citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
Sections were then washed in TBS (pH 7.4) and incubated for one hour or overnight in anti-Iba1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:300; Wako), anti-CD68 (mouse IgG3, 1:100; Dako) or, anti-HLA-DR (1:250, Biomeda) in TBS 1% BSA.
Signal was revealed using the DAKO Envision+System-HRP Labelled Polymer Anti-Rabbit or Anti-Mouse or the NovoLinkTM Polymer Detection System (NovocastraTM), followed by Diaminobenzydine (DAB) as chromogen and Hematoxylin as counterstain.
For detection of microglia around the plaques, we combined silver staining with Iba1 IHC by using the MACH4 Universal HRP-Polymer kit (Biocare) and signal was revealed by Ferangi Blue Chromogen Kit (Biocare).
Images were acquired with an Olympus Bx60 microscope and Cell Sens Standard Ink imaging software (Olympus Corporation) mounted on a DP73 Olympus camera.

Quantification of staining
For measurement of perinuclear Serpina3n and C4b intensity, oligodendrocyte nuclei were determined using the Surfaces function of Imaris on Olig2 data.
After Olig2 + surfaces were defined, the perinuclear region was defined as within 2 μm of the Olig2 + surface.
This was accomplished by using the "Distance from Surfaces" function on the Olig2 + surfaces to assign a value to each voxel representing the distance to the nearest Olig2 + surface.
Next, a threshold of 2 μm or smaller was used to generate another set of surfaces including the nucleus and perinuclear region.
The intensity of staining within these surfaces was determined by taking the mean of voxel intensity values within the surfaces.
Two images were acquired per brain for quantification.
For measurement of Serpina3n intensity in CA2 + cells, oligodendrocytes were determined using the Surfaces Function of Imaris on CA2 channel.
Intensity of Serpina3n was then quantified by calculating the weighted average of Serpina3n mean fluorescence intensity over the volume of CA2 surfaces.
Three images were acquired per brain for quantification.
Number of Olig2 + or CA2 + oligodendrocytes was quantified by counting the total number of Olig2 + or CA2 + Surfaces per image generated as described above.
For measurement of oligodendrocyte density around plaques, plaque volume and center of mass were determined using the Surfaces function of Imaris on methoxy-X04 image data.
Oligodendrocyte nuclei were identified using the Spots function of Imaris for Olig2 nuclear staining.
To calculate the number of oligodendrocyte nuclei within a given distance from plaque surfaces, each plaque was modeled as an idealized sphere with the same volume and center of mass.
Pairwise Euclidean distances were calculated between each oligodendrocyte nucleus and each plaque, taking into account the idealized plaque radius.
For each plaque, the number of oligodendrocytes within the specified distance was enumerated.
Oligodendrocytes were allowed to be counted for multiple plaques.
Next, the occupiable volume for oligodendrocytes was calculated by finding the volume of the sphere (or spherical segment) that falls within the specified distance.
As an example, for a plaque of radius 10 μm and a cutoff of 30 μm, the volume of a 40-μm sphere is determined.
If either the top or bottom of this sphere (or both) extends beyond the top or bottom of the z-stack, respectively, the volume is calculated using the formula for spherical segments instead of the formula for a sphere.
Finally, the number of oligodendrocytes is divided by the occupiable volume to obtain the density, and these values are averaged for all the plaques for a given animal.

Proteomics and phospho-proteomics
Lysis, digestion, and preparation for mass spectrometry analysis-Frozen half brain sections were lysed in 5 mL of lysis buffer containing 8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.5, phosphatase inhibitors (1mM β-glycerophosphate, 1mM sodium orthovanadate), homogenized with a Polytron, and probe tip sonicated.
Samples were subsequently reduced with 5 mM DTT for 50 min at 55°C, alkylated for 30 min with 10 mM iodoacetamide, and quenched with 5 mM DTT.
Samples were diluted to 2M urea with digestion dilution buffer (20 mM pH 8.5 HEPES containing 1mM CaCl 2 ) and digested at 37 °C with 100μg of Lysyl Endopeptidase (Wako-Chem).
Samples were then diluted to 1 M urea and digested for 5 hours with 100 μg of trypsin (Pierce).
Following digestion, peptides were acidified with TFA, centrifuged at 500 x g for 20 min and purified over SepPak C18 columns.
Following elution, peptides were quantified with a MicroBCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA).
Total protein sample preparation-20 μg of peptides from each sample were labeled with isobaric tandem-mass-tag (TMT) 11 plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) in 20 mM pH 8.5 HEPES with 30% acetonitrile (v/v) with 50 μg of TMT reagent.
The reaction was quenched for 15 min by adding hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v).
The plex design is shown in Table
Samples were combined, dried, purified over SepPak C18 columns, and dried again.
Samples were then resuspended in 50 μL of bRP buffer A (10 mM NH 4 HCO 2 , pH10, 5% ACN) and separated on a Zorbax Extended C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 3.5 μm, no.

Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled with a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography (LC) pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA).
Peptides were separated on a 100 μm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with ~40 cm of Accucore150 resin (2.6 μm, 150 Å, ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA).
For each analysis, we loaded approximately 1 μg onto the column.
Peptides were separated using either a 2.5 h gradient of 6-30% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid with a flow rate of 550 nL/min.
Each analysis used an SPS-MS3based TMT method
The scan sequence began with an MS1 spectrum (Orbitrap analysis, resolution 120,000; 350-1400 m/z, automatic gain control (AGC) target 4.0 × 10 5 , maximum injection time 50 ms).
Precursors for MS2/MS3 analysis were selected using a Top10 method.
MS2 analysis consisted of collision-induced dissociation (quadrupole ion trap; AGC 2.0 × 10 4 ; normalized collision energy (NCE) 35; maximum injection time 120 ms).
Following acquisition of each MS2 spectrum, we collected an MS3 spectrum a method in which multiple MS2 fragment ions are captured in the MS3 precursor population using isolation waveforms with multiple frequency notches
MS3 precursors were fragmented by HCD and analyzed using the Orbitrap (NCE 65, AGC 3.5 × 10 5 , maximum injection time 150 ms, isolation window 1.2 Th, resolution was 50,000 at 200 Th).
