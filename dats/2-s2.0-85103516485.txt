Astrocytic Propagation of Tau in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease
More than 6 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the incidence is growing rapidly with our aging population.
Numerous therapeutics have failed to make it to the clinic, potentially due to a focus on presumptive pathogenic proteins instead of cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms.
The tau propagation hypothesis that inter-neuronal tau transfer drives AD pathology has recently garnered attention, as accumulation of pathological tau in the brain has high clinical significance in correlating with progression of cognitive AD symptoms.
However, studies on tau pathology in AD are classically neuron-centric and have greatly overlooked cell-type specific effects of tau internalization, degradation, and propagation.
While the contribution of microglia to tau processing and propagation is beginning to be recognized and understood, astrocytes, glial cells in the brain important for maintaining neuronal metabolic, synaptic, trophic, and immune function which can produce, internalize, degrade, and propagate tau are understudied in their ability to affect AD progression through tau pathology.
Here, we showcase evidence for whether tau uptake by astrocytes may be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal health and how astrocytes and their immunometabolic functions may be key targets for future successful AD therapies.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing rapidly in many countries due to an aging population and lack of successful therapeutics
Unsuccessful therapeutic candidates may have failed for many reasons, including a strategy nearly exclusively focused on targeting the expression and aggregation of presumptive neurotoxic proteins at stages of disease when these processes may already be obsolete
These strategies have targeted what are known as the hallmarks of AD, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, or tau) aggregates
Accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is clinically significant as it correlates with progression of cognitive symptoms better than other markers, including Aβ
Tau is a cytoskeletal protein that stabilizes microtubules of neuron axons
When monomeric tau becomes hyperphosphorylated
Pathological tau aggregates can develop into neurofibrillary tangles inside the neuron, leading to neuronal degeneration by unknown mechanisms
Initiation of tau hyperphosphorylation is not well-understood but defining the molecular mechanisms of initial hyperphosphorylation induction and propagation of tauopathy through the brain is paramount to slowing or stopping the spread of pathological tau and identifying new candidates for effective AD therapeutics.
Neurons can secrete tau into the extracellular space, as evidenced by quantifiable release from stimulated neurons in vitro and in vivo
This finding has influenced the tau propagation hypothesis, which proposes that inter-neuronal tau transfer drives AD pathology
Importantly, tau is also wellknown to spread through synaptic connections (Spires-
Tauopathy is characteristically associated with neurons because neurons express far more tau than other cell types in the brain
However, tau internalization has been observed in astrocytes and microglia, both in vivo and in vitro
Aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) is the umbrella term used to define astrocytes with abnormal accumulation of pathological tau.
ARTAG is found in not only AD, but also neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
Thorn-shape astrocytes (TSA) and granular-fuzzy astrocytes (GFA) are the astrocytic morphologies characteristic of ARTAG.
In particular, astrocytes can both degrade and propagate tau
Astrocytes are a particularly interesting target due to their role in the tripartite synapse
Astrocytes also regulate neuroinflammatory responses through cytokine signaling
Indeed, AD patients are known to have high levels of neuroinflammation
Tau accumulation is promoted in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα
Sustained astrogliosis [astrocytic activation
The mechanism by which astrocytic tau internalization may promote tau propagation, astrogliosis, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and subsequent neurodegeneration is unknown
Defining the molecular underpinnings of this relationship will aid in developing a mechanistic roadmap of AD progression, from the initial insult of astrocytic tau internalization to the end result of progressive neuronal death.
This review focuses on the role of astrocytes in tau propagation, and how astrocytic internalization and failure to degrade tau can promote the spread of disease pathology.
We explore previous findings that suggest how tau uptake by astrocytes may be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal health and consider how the repercussions of astrocytic tau propagation fit into the larger picture of neurodegeneration.

TAU INTERNALIZATION IN ASTROCYTES
Healthy neurons express robust levels of tau that localize to axonal microtubules for transport and stabilization
In neurons of AD patients, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, causing it to disassociate from the microtubule and form pathological aggregates that spread in a characteristic pattern, originating in the entorhinal cortex and locus coeruleus and progressing to the neocortex
Healthy astrocytes express very low levels of tau
Despite low endogenous astrocytic expression, hyperphosphorylated tau has been observed in astrocytes in AD
Primary human astrocytes do not increase expression of tau when stimulated with Aβ
Mechanisms of tau secretion and internalization by neurons are well-understood
Tau can be internalized by astrocytes as monomers
Astrocytes internalize tau monomers in vitro
When neurons accumulate neurofibrillary tau tangles they die and leave "ghost tangles, " stable tau aggregates without the presence of a cell nucleus, in the extracellular space
Astrocytes can infiltrate ghost tangles with their processes, contributing to tau accumulation in astrocytes in AD
Cultured human astrocytes internalize and release tau at a steady rate, even without stimulation
Further observations indicate that tau monomers are internalized by astrocytes through a non-heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-mediated mechanism
Additionally, tau internalization by astrocytes can come from phagocytosis of plaque-associated dystrophic neurites
Astrocytes are well-known to react against Aβ plaques
Further studies are required to determine whether neuronal receptors of tau [including LRP1

FACTORS INFLUENCING ASTROCYTIC TAU INTERNALIZATION
A number of AD-relevant factors may alter levels of astrocytic tau internalization.
Elevated cholesterol is known to promote tau phosphorylation and subsequent tauopathy
Astrocytes are the primary producers of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the brain, and APOE carries cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons
Of the 3 APOE isoforms, APOE ε4 is the strongest and most common genetic risk factor for late-onset AD as compared to the most common APOE isoform, APOE ε3, while the third isoform, APOE ε2, may increase risk for primary tauopathies
APOE ε4 increases the risk of AD by 4-to 14-fold
APOE ε4 carriers exhibit increased astrocytic cholesterol biosynthesis and intracellular cholesterol accumulation
This impaired cholesterol trafficking leads to endosomal dysfunction, resulting in AD pathology
Despite the stark increase in AD risk conveyed by APOE ε4, its mechanism, and especially its impact on development and progression of tau pathology, remains incompletely understood
Elevated levels of cholesterol observed in neural cells of APOE ε4 carriers
Increased cholesterol levels also increase phagocytic behavior in macrophages
Thus, APOE ε4 astrocytes, which have increased cholesterol levels
On the other hand, a study of post-mortem human brain tissue found no effect of APOE genotype on ARTAG
Previous studies indicate decreases in APOE ε4 astrocyte autophagy with Aβ internalization
Finally, APOE ε2 has been shown to increase primary tauopathy pathology when Aβ is not present
Aβ is known to increase the total tau accumulation in astrocytes
Another factor influencing astrocytic tau internalization and subsequent propagation is extracellular tau concentration.
Astrocytic tau internalization has been observed in vitro upon addition of varying concentrations of tau
While the intraneuronal physiological concentration of tau is ∼2 µM
Therefore, the 2 µM used in tau internalization studies is ∼5-fold greater than what is seen in CSF of AD patients and may lead to misleading results in the case of non-specific internalization, like pinocytosis.
Additionally, the aggregation state of tau (oligomer, fibril, monomer, etc), as well as the isoform (0N3R, 0N4R, 1N3R, 1N4R, 2N3R, and 2N4R) may modulate the likelihood and rate of internalization
All six tau isoforms are expressed in AD, and tau tangles in post mortem AD brains have an even ratio of 3R to 4R isoforms
While 3R and 4R tau are both found in neuronal tau pathology in the AD brain, studies describing ARTAG in AD report mainly 4R tau pathology in astrocytes
Most internalization studies use only 2N4R tau
A recent study found 3R astrocytic tau inclusions in the hilus of the hippocampus associated with increased AD Braak stage and correlating with synaptic protein levels
Microglia internalize more 2N4R tau aggregates in vitro than do astrocytes or neurons
However, astrocytes play different support roles than microglia, namely in metabolic, trophic, and synaptic functions, which could be detrimentally influenced more strongly by smaller amounts of tau internalization than those affecting microglia.
A comparison of astrocytic internalization in both isolated and multi-cell type systems is crucial to fully understand this complex relationship.

ASTROCYTIC DEGRADATION AND PROPAGATION OF INTERNALIZED TAU
Similarly to the mechanism and cellular consequences of astrocytic tau internalization, the fate of internalized tau has been understudied
Astrocytic tau accumulation is seen in primary tauopathies such as supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD)
In these diseases, as well as in secondary tauopathies such as AD, ARTAG with perinuclear hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates have been observed
Tau accumulation in astrocytes has been demonstrated robustly in AD post mortem brains
Once internalized by astrocytes, three outcomes for tau are possible: degradation, re-release, or accumulation (Figure
Astrocytes may act as a specialized tau vacuum, engulfing pathological tau from the extracellular matrix of the brain and breaking it down to be recycled.
Pre-formed tau fibrils, internalized by astrocytes through micropinocytosis, are degraded by lysosomes in vitro
When the lysosomal Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) was overexpressed in astrocytes in vitro and in vivo, both incidence and spread of pathological tau was decreased, indicating that astrocytes have the ability to both degrade and propagate tau
Additionally, tau is an intrinsically disordered protein, increasing its likelihood for degradation
However, it was recently shown that the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau decreases its proteasomal degradation, which may lead to further tau accumulation
These findings suggest astrocytic tau internalization as a potential therapeutic target for tauopathy, where increasing tau internalization could prevent tau propagation.
Discrepancies in the literature over tau expression and secretion in astrocytes warrant greater scrutiny to truly understand cell-type specific changes in the AD and aging brain.
Contradicting results have been found between murine and human systems, and between in vitro and ex vivo paradigms.
Each of these experimental systems has caveats, and thus identifying which results are most relevant to disease in patients is difficult.
Primary human astrocytes display diffuse tau expression and secrete tau in exosomes
Conversely, while primary murine microglia take up 2N4R tau oligomers by phagocytosis and release tau in exosomes
However, exosomal tau is not the majority of tau in patient CSF, and therefore glial exosomal tau may not be a disease-relevant pathology
When ADpathological human tau was injected into wild-type mice, only neurons propagated the injected tau
These conflicting findings underscore that astrocytic tau uptake and propagation remains poorly studied in the AD field, and thus the role that astrocytes play in tau propagation in AD remains unknown.
Tau can become hyperphosphorylated and dissociate from the microtubules due to a myriad of factors
Stimulated or dying neurons can release tau into the extracellular space
Astrocytic internalization rates may be affected by a number of factors, including cholesterol levels; APOE status; and tau concentration, aggregation state, and isoform.
Following internalization, astrocytes may (1) degrade the internalized tau, (2) release the tau back out of the cell, potentially propagating the pathological tau to healthy neurons, and (3) accumulate tau, potentially triggering inflammatory cytokine release, which can harm neuronal health.

DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF ASTROCYTIC TAU INTERNALIZATION
The majority of AD tau pathology research focuses on neurons, yet astrocytes play a vital role in maintaining neuronal fitness in the presence of AD pathology
As part of the tripartite synapse, astrocytes are well-positioned to receive tau released from neurons and internalize extracellular tau
Tau that remains in the extracellular space has been well-established to contribute to the propagation of tau pathology
However, there is little understanding of the repercussions of astrocytic tau internalization for disease progression and outcome.
While uptake of tau from the extracellular space may aid in decreasing direct neurotoxic effects of tau on neurons, this uptake and presence of pathological tau species intracellularly could have detrimental effects on astrocytes themselves.
Astrocytic support functions to neurons could thus be negatively impacted
Tau is normally expressed at very low levels in astrocytes
When high levels of tau have been artificially induced in astrocytes, a body of evidence suggests it is detrimental to cellular function and viability
Transgenic mice expressing wild-type and mutant human tau protein in astrocytes have decreased levels of glutamate transporters in the brain and spinal cord
Decreased glutamate transporter expression can impair neuronal signaling and cause glutamate toxicity, and inducing human tau expression in primary rat astrocytes causes cytoskeletal collapse followed by astrocyte death
Decreased astrocytic viability also decreases critical neuronal metabolic support, resulting in greater potential for neuron death
Recent evidence also suggests that synaptic density is altered in a 1N3R tau overexpression system in astrocytes
Additionally, astrocytes overexpressing 1N3R tau in the hilus impair inhibitory neurons and cause asynchronous activity in neurons, leading to decreased spatial memory in mice
Taken together, this evidence and the innate phagocytic properties of astrocytes
In addition to metabolic and neurotransmitter dysregulation caused by astrocytes, chronic exposure to inflammatory cytokines is well-known to decrease neuronal health
Glial-expressed cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 are upregulated in AD
Astrocytes are a key player in regulating cytokine secretion in the brain, an important task for both maintenance signaling and injury communication between cells.
Astrocytic tau sequestration may elicit an inflammatory response from astrocytes, and in turn, these proinflammatory signals can decrease neuronal health
While there is no current evidence for how stimulation of astrocytes with tau affects cytokine secretion, primary human astrocytes stimulated with TNFα or IL-1β produce more inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-1ra, MIP-1α (CCL3), and RANTES (CCL5)
Additionally, cultured neurons exposed to inflammatory cytokine TNFα have increased tau pathology
Ex vivo, transgenic mutant tau mice exhibit glial activation, with increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
It is notable that while a number of studies have examined diseased tissue and shown correlation between tau and inflammation, no studies exist which test the causative mechanism of the effects of astrocytic tau internalization on both astrocytes and neurons.
Determining precise cytokine reactions caused by astrocytic tau internalization could help determine the character and severity of the impact astrocytic tau internalization has on propagating tau pathology.
Finally, tau internalization by astrocytes may lead to dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through two key avenues: increased astrogliosis and decreased levels of tight junction and adhesion proteins.
The BBB is a critical structure for protecting the brain microenvironment from toxins, as well as an important passageway for vital nutrients to enter the tissue.
Astrocytes are an essential component of the BBB's multicellular selective barrier between peripheral blood flow and the brain parenchyma, with their endfeet forming a sheath around the vessels that produce the basement membrane for the parenchyma
Damage to the BBB is well-documented in AD; it is less appreciated that BBB damage is also present in primary tauopathies, suggesting aberrant tau as a key contributor to BBB damage in AD
Notably, ARTAG commonly localizes to perivascular astrocytes
Overexpression of human tau is known to disrupt astrocytic BBB functions
Ex vivo studies of transgenic mice expressing mutant human tau demonstrate that phosphorylated tau from neurons of the entorhinal cortex is internalized by astrocytes, causing an increase in GFAP expression when compared to wild-type mice, indicative of astrogliosis
Additional studies have confirmed that transgenic mice expressing mutant

Known Unknown
Astrocytes have very low endogenous levels of tau but can internalize tau from the extracellular matrix and ghost tangles.
What is the mechanism for monomeric tau internalization in astrocytes?
Astrocytes play a key role in neuronal health and astrocytic tau internalization alters astrocyte morphology and function.
At what rate do astrocytes degrade/propagate tau?
While microglia also play a role in tau internalization, astrocytic changes are understudied in the context of tau pathology in AD.
What are the repercussions to neurons when astrocytes internalize tau?
tau exhibit significant astrogliosis that increases with age
Reactive astrogliosis induces inflammatory cytokine production, where cytokines such as VEGF-A can decrease levels of tight junction proteins vital to BBB function
Notably, the onset of neuroinflammation precedes BBB dysfunction in transgenic mutant tau mice
Recent studies have begun to identify the effects of pathological tau on endothelial cells of the BBB, showing that pathological tau deteriorates brain microvasculature and increases senesce genes, leading to impaired blood flow
However, because the majority of studies of tau pathology in AD focus on neurons, the mechanism of BBB damage due to astrocytic tau internalization remains only indirectly studied.
Deciphering the potential mechanisms by which astrocytic tau internalization may affect BBB integrity is critical for understanding neurodegenerative pathology and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
As we have presented, the phagocytic behavior of astrocytes removes toxic tau from the extracellular space
Rapid removal of tau by cells other than neurons [e.g., microglia] can thus also contribute to neuronal health
However, microglia are likely to participate in tau seeding and propagation more often than in mitigation
While astrocytic internalization holds promise as a potential target for modulating the toxicity of pathological tau species, both potential benefits and possible indirect negative effects on neuronal health need to be weighed before this phenomenon can be considered for developing therapeutic strategies against neurodegeneration.
If astrocytes internalize tau and the majority is degraded, successful therapeutics may be found in enhancement of the yet-uncharacterized astrocytic internalization mechanism of various tau isoforms.
Conversely, if future studies find that astrocytes internalize pathological tau only to spread it to nearby healthy neurons, inhibition of the secretion mechanism (also yet to be characterized) could be targeted to stop the spread of tau pathology in the AD brain.
Finally, if the disease-relevant insult due to astrocytic tau internalization is secondary to the spread of tau pathology, such as BBB damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, or metabolic dysfunction, such evidence would further support the vascular, inflammatory, and metabolic hypotheses of AD, respectively, and further investigation of these downstream effects could serve to identify targets in those domains.

CONCLUSION
The majority of tau pathology research in the field of AD focuses on neurons.
Recently, studies have begun to shift toward elucidating the effects of pathological tau on glial cell types
Evidence suggests that astrocytic tau internalization may be the lynchpin of several disparate hypotheses of AD, including the proteinopathy, inflammatory, vascular, and metabolic hypotheses.
As part of the tripartite synapse, astrocytes are well-positioned to receive tau released from neurons and to internalize extracellular tau
Tau released by neurons into the extracellular space contributes to tau propagation
Here, we present evidence for dual, opposing roles of astrocytic tau sequestration: as either a reactionary mechanism for clearance and degradation of tau from the extracellular space, or as a temporary holding place before re-release and propagation of pathological tau to more neurons.
While contained within astrocytes, internalized tau may initialize cascades leading to astrogliosis, producing inflammatory responses as secreted cytokines, and thereby decrease neuronal health.
Astrocytes may also internalize tau and fail to degrade it, leading to propagation of pathological tau out to more neurons.
Astrocytes are largely stationary, but methods of release such as exocytosis, transduction through plasma membrane channels and transporters, and exosome release may give astrocytes the ability to propagate pathological tau to nearby neurons.
Elucidation of the mechanism of astrocytic involvement in tau propagation could hold the key to uncovering novel therapeutic directions (Table
Without addressing the critical gaps in knowledge connecting astrocytic behavior with tau degradation and propagation tauopathy in AD, we are missing key opportunities to diversify our approaches to someday prevent, halt, and even reverse neurodegeneration.
