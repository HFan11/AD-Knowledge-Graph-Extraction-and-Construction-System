Astroglia in Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.
Cellular changes in the brains of the patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease occur well in advance of the clinical symptoms.
At the cellular level, the most dramatic is a demise of neurones.
As astroglial cells carry out homeostatic functions of the brain, it is certain that these cells are at least in part a cause of Alzheimer's disease.
Historically, Alois Alzheimer himself has recognised this at the dawn of the disease description.
However, the role of astroglia in this disease has been understudied.
In this chapter, we summarise the various aspects of glial contribution to this disease and outline the potential of using these cells in prevention (exercise and environmental enrichment) and intervention of this devastating disease.

Senile Dementia-The Outcome of Pathological Ageing
Dementia as a medical term was introduced in the first century AD by Aulus Cornelius Celsus in his fundamental discourse De Medicina
The term dementia originates from the prefix "de" (meaning "out of"), the stem "ment" ('mind') and the suffix "ia" (diseased condition).
Historically, this term was used in a very broad sense to indicate chronic cognitive impairments associated with psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations.
However, dementia was not associated with age-dependent cognitive decline, although from the very dawn of medical observations, these impairments were considered as an essential and inevitable part of ageing process.
Already in the seventh century BC, Pythagoras defined the advanced ages of human life as "senium" when "the system returns to the imbecility of the first epoch of infancy"
From Aristotle to Lucretius and Galen, the ageing was considered to be associated with mental decline, impossible to arrest or recuperate
This gloomy outlook was not, however, shared by Cicero who believed in selective development of a senescence-dependent cognitive decline: "senile imbecility does not occur in all old men, but only in those of feeble mind"
Over centuries the mental weakness of old people was defined as senility, idiocy, morosis, dotage, etc.; in 1794, the term dementia was formalised by Philippe Pinel and this term was officially recognised by the French Law
At the end of the nineteenth century, the definition of senile dementia became widespread and underlying histopathology became to be scrutinised.
The specific lesions, the plaques (then known as miliary foci), were discovered by Block and Marinesco in the brain of old epileptic patient
In 1903, Max Bielschowsky developed an improved version of the Golgi silver stain that allowed visualisation of neurofibrilles
Using this new technique, Alois
These tangles displayed extraordinary thickness and often merged into dense bundles reaching the surface of a neurone
The brain of Augusta D also contained senile plaques, and thus the case of early dementia associated with appearance of senile plaques and pathological neurofibrillary tangles has been reported in 1907
This was a rather unique description, which differed from the widespread dementia of the early twentieth century associated predominantly with neurosyphilis or vascular ischemic brain damage.
The disease was named "Alzheimersche krankheit" by Emil Kraepelin in the 8 th edition of his immensely influential textbook on Psychiatry (Psychiatrie: Ein Lehrbuch fuer Studierende und Arzte).
Kraepelin defined this new disease as a rapidly progressive, early-onset dementia distinct from the senile dementia
Alzheimer's disease (AD) was rarely diagnosed in the first half of the twentieth century and was generally regarded as a rare pathology that affected relatively young persons.
Only in 1960, the AD histopathology was related to the sporadic cases of age-dependent (i.e.
senile) dementia and the notion of AD as senescent-associated pathology had been developed
It seems also that the pandemic of the senile dementia observed in recent years has evolved over the last century.
Detailed physiological investigation of organs and systems of an extended population (826 subjects) of elderly (80-100 years of age) inhabitants of the UK performed in 1889 revealed surprisingly little changes in their cognitive status.
Furthermore "… the brain in many held out as well or better than other organs -which may be regarded one of the bright rays, if not the brightest, in the centenarian landscape"
Indeed, in this study dementia was observed only in 2 out of 74 centenarians.
This contrasts remarkably with our times, when >50% of people older than 85 demonstrate signs of severe cognitive impairment
Of course, evolution of epidemiological changes may be interpreted from many angles, and yet it is impossible not to speculate that an increased environmental toxicity, changes in diet and mounting social pressure have contributed to a rise of sporadic AD in the modern population.
Increased prevalence of senile dementia at advanced age parallels increase in life expectancy.
Modern definition regards AD as a severe neurodegenerative disorder associated with specific histopathological markers represented by (i) focal extracellular deposits of fibrillar β-amyloid generally known as neuritic or senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and the walls of blood vessels, and (ii) intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles composed of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau filaments
AD affects specific brain regions associated with learning and memory, including the basal forebrain, the hippocampus and the neocortex.
Clinical symptoms of AD are manifested by a progressive decline of cognitive functions including short-and long-term memory
At advanced stages of the disease, clinical presentation of AD is complicated by a variety of behavioural disturbances including agitation, irritability, anxiety, delusions and depression
Conceptually, two forms of AD are defined: (i) early-onset or familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and (ii) late-onset or sporadic AD, or SAD
Epidemiologically, the late-onset SAD accounts for the absolute majority (95-99%) of AD cases in people above 65 years of age.
The familial variant of AD is associated with mutations in three genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), which are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner
In contrast to SAD, which is linked to an old age, the familial AD occurs in much younger group of patients between 40 and 50 years old; the FAD is characterised by a rapid progression and idiosyncratic clinical manifestation.
Anatomical and histopathological progression of AD begins from early degeneration of cholinergic neurones in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and septum.
In parallel, the accumulation of intraneuronal β-amyloid and formation of neurofibrillary tangles develop, which ultimately leads to an emergence of senile plaques
Deterioration of neuronal networks begins with synaptic damage and malfunction which affects CNS plasticity; these changes occur prior to the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and prior to neuronal death
In addition, this process suppresses neurogenesis, which further impairs neuronal plasticity
Apart from the cholinergic system, AD pathology impairs other major neurotransmitter systems including noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic

Experimental Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease, similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, is a specific disease of humans; animals as a rule do not develop AD-like pathology
Experimental study of AD therefore requires the development of animal disease models which are capable of faithful reproduction of single or multiple subsets of neuropathological, histological, cellular, behavioural or biochemical alterations resembling those seen in classical AD

Old Animals
The very first models of AD were represented by aged animals
In monkeys, alterations of cholinergic neurones were even associated with β-amyloid depositions
In addition, old animals showed not only a cholinergic dysfunction but also a concomitant alteration of other neurotransmitter systems such as the monoaminergic, peptidergic or serotonergic

Lesions
The global lesion models of AD (Table
At the beginning, the electrolytic lesions were used; these caused diffuse damage of several brain areas and lacked specificity
In the majority of global lesion models, the non-selective excitotoxic toxins such as NMDA, ibotenic acid, quisqualic acid, quinolinic acid, colchicine and other alkaloid substances were employed
Injections of these substances triggered cell death with consequent neurological dysfunctions including impaired cognition.
The global lesion models also employed injections of alcohol, which is toxic to cholinergic neurons
As mentioned above, a loss of cholinergic neurones is a prominent feature of AD
With this in mind, animal models, which employed specific lesioning of cholinergic neurones, were developed.
Among these, the most relevant were the rodent models with lesions in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, which is the equivalent of the nucleus of Meynert in humans
Specific cholinergic lesion models used toxins, which affected only cholinergic neurones in the brain regions relevant to AD, including septum, nucleus basalis magnocellularis and the diagonal band of Broca, but did not impair non-cholinergic neurones
For example, the AF64A cholinotoxin, which binds to the high-affinity choline uptake system, was injected.
Alternatively, the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin that binds selectively and irreversibly to low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor interrupting cholinergic neuronal protein synthesis was employed.
Both techniques lead to selective impairment and death of cholinergic neurones
Similarly, the noradrenergic system can be lesioned in rats by the injection of the construct, consisting of antibody against dopamine-β-hydroxylase, the enzyme converting dopamine to noradrenaline, and saporin [215], a ribosome-inactivating plant lectin extracted from Saponaria officinalis (Caryophyllaceae)
This technology allows a selective and gradual lesioning of noradrenergic neurones in the brain stem nucleus locus coeruleus, the primary site of noradrenaline production in the CNS
Upon injection into the LC, this immunotoxin binds dopamine-β-hydroxylase, which is not only localised mainly in the cytosol, but also at the plasma membrane surface of noradrenergic neurones
Due to its structure, saporin cannot enter the cell
In initial anatomical investigations, the immunotoxin, infused into the lateral ventricles of either adult
The possibility to induce a partial or total noradrenergic loss (by varying the injected dose) makes this immunotoxic approach an ideal model to study events within the noradrenergic projection system, as they occur during age-related demise of locus coeruleus in humans

Transgenic Animals
The AD models described above, although triggering neuronal death with consequent cognitive impairments, did not mimic histopathology and temporal progression of the disease.
In the last two decades, an alternative and much more effective approach of using transgenic technologies have produced numerous models of familial forms of AD, which have been widely employed in experimental research.
These transgenic animal models replicate several neuropathological features of AD
The very first transgenic animal carrying mutant APP and showing an AD-like pathology was developed in 1995
In this model, known as PDAPP, several pathological hallmarks of AD have been identified, including extracellular β-amyloid deposits, dystrophy of neurites, astrogliosis and memory impairments.
Memory impairments, however, did not show any correlation with β-amyloid load
The next transgenic AD mouse model, designated as Tg2576 mice, harboured APP swe (Swedish K670 N/M671L) mutation; this model developed numerous senile plaques in parallel with learning and memory impairments, which begun to develop from 9 months of age onwards
The next generation of transgenic models carried double mutation of APP gene; such a model known as APP23 demonstrated some (~14%) neuronal death in the hippocampus
The next step was to combine mutated APP and PS genes; co-expression of PS1 dE9 with APP Swe resulted in an AD mouse model characterised by accelerated β-amyloid deposition and memory deficits but without tangle formation
These developments culminated in creation of 5xTG AD mice, designated as Tg6799; these animals carry a single human APP Swedish K670N/M671L double mutation as well as the Florida I716V mutation, and the London V717I mutation, along with PS with double M146L and L286V mutations.
These mice develop amyloid depositions as early as 2 months of age
In parallel to the animal models with increased β-amyloid production, the pathological tau models also have been created; the first being produced in 1995.
In this model, the hyperphosphorylated tau was accumulated in neuronal somata and dendrites, although neurofibrillary tangles were never developed
The next tauopa thy model, overexpressing Tau P301L , did develop neurofibrillary tangles without β-amyloid pathology and neuronal loss
In 2003, the triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) was created combining the mutants of the three major implicated genes; these animals harbour the mutant genes for APP Swe , for presenilin PS1M146V and for Tau P301L
These animals demonstrated temporaland region-specific Aβ and tau pathology, which resembles that seen in the human AD brain.
Additionally, the 3xTg-AD animals also displayed plaques and tangles, and also showed reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus along with functional and cognitive impairments seen as deficient spatial and long-term memory
These pathological changes progress in an age-related manner; most importantly functional deficits precede the appearance of histological hallmarks.
Cognitive deficits in the 3xTg-AD model correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ
Moreover, at the cellular level, changes in astroglial subcellular vesicle traffic contribute to the pathophysiology of AD

Neurodegenerative Diseases and Neuroglia
Neurodegenerative diseases, which affect almost exclusively humans, are chronic disorders that result in a progressive loss of function, structure and number of neural cells, ultimately resulting in atrophy of the brain and profound cognitive deficit.
The aetiology of neurodegeneration is complex and multifaceted.
Neurodegeneration can have a genetic background or it can be instigated by acute trauma, by chemical poisoning, by metabolic insufficiencies or by infectious attacks, as well as by vascular abnormalities, or by sporadic accumulation of genetic/biochemical errors of unknown nature.
At the early stages, neurodegeneration as a rule affects synaptic contacts in the brain tissue, thus causing early cognitive deficits.
The early stages of neurodegeneration are of course of specific significance, because during this early phase the pathological process can be arrested or even reversed, thus offering the hope for preventing the cognitive decline.
Cellular and molecular mechanisms of underlying initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases are highly complex, which makes it almost impossible to identify a single leading cause.
At the level of cellular biochemistry, neurodegeneration is frequently linked to aberrant handling of proteins, which promotes intra-or extracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins such as, for example, β-amyloid, tau or α-synuclein
At a more systemic level, however, neurodegeneration reflects a generalised failure of brain homeostasis, which results in a functional and structural decline in the connectivity of neural networks, thus ultimately destroying information processing.
Neurodegeneration starts from functional impairment of synaptic connectivity and synaptic plasticity which leads to a neurotransmission misbalance; these processes stipulate early cognitive deficiency.
With further progression of the neurodegenerative process, the structural abnormalities develop, trigger disappearance of synapses and death of neural cells, ultimately resulting in a generalised atrophy of the brain accompanied with profound cognitive deficiency
The neuroglia provides for the birth, maintenance and demise of synapses, as well as for overall homeostasis of the nerve tissue, these functions being summarised in a concept of the astroglial cradle
Thus, these non-neuronal cells likely represent the main cellular element shaping the progression of neurodegenerative processes.
The generally acknowledged and prevailing point of view considers neurones as main substrates of neurodegeneration, and it is generally assumed that failures in neuronal protein synthesis and/or direct neuronal damage caused by various factors constitute the leading mechanism of neurodegenerative pathologies.
These neurone-centric doctrine has been challenged in the past decade, with considerable attention re-routed to neuroglia, which being primary cells responsible for the brain homeostasis and defences, fundamentally contribute to an overall homeostatic failure promoting neurodegeneration

Astroglial Atrophy and Astrogliosis in Neurodegenerative Diseases
Astrogliopathology in neurodegenerative diseases includes reactivity and astroglial atrophy, asthenia and loss of function.
These processes develop in a stage-specific manner and contribute to pathological progression; frequently astroglial asthenia develops at early stages of the disease, whereas at the advanced stages an emergence of disease-specific lesions (for example, senile plaques) and death of neurones instigates astroglial reactivity
Pathological changes in astroglia evolve in parallel with microglial responses.
Microglial reactions, at least in the context of human disease, are represented by either activation (that may contribute to neuroinflammatory progression) or microglial paralysis with loss of neuroprotective capabilities, which all contribute to brain atrophy.
Cells of oligodendroglial lineage are also affected, which leads to a failure in myelination and atrophy of brain connectome.

Neurodegeneration Following Toxic Brain Injury
Astrocytes play the leading role in chronic neurodegeneration following the brain poisoning by toxic agents.
The core mechanism underlying this astroglial-dependent neurotoxicity, which leads to a substantial neuronal death, is linked to a failure of astroglial glutamate uptake.
Glutamate clearance from the extracellular space is mainly accomplished by astroglial Na + -dependent plasmalemmal glutamate transporters; astrocytes specifically express two types of these glutamate transporters, the excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (EAAT1 and 2).
This glutamate uptake is fundamental for astroglia-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate excitotoxicity; suppressing of astroglial glutamate uptake greatly increases neuronal damage following exposure to glutamate
Astroglial glutamate uptake is usually impaired in neurodegeneration and can be considered as one of the common mechanisms of this process
Exposure to heavy metals triggers neuronal death underlying condition known as heavy metal toxic encephalopathy, which manifests itself by impaired cognition and psychotic symptoms.
This neurotoxicity results from astroglial homeostatic failure; heavy metals are accumulated by astroglial cells, thus damaging pathways responsible for glutamate homeostasis and catabolism.
In methylmercury-induced encephalopathy known as Minamata disease (the name derives from the Japanese city of Minamata where massive poisoning with methylmercury occurred in 1950s, see
When in astrocytes, methylmercury inhibits glutamate, glutamine and cystine transporters which compromises glutamate homoeostasis
Resulting increase in extracellular glutamate concentration triggers neuronal death underlying clinical symptoms that include cognitive decline, impaired vision and hearing, as well as motor symptoms.
Similarly, astrocytes, endowed with capacity manganese transport system, emerge as a main target for manganese toxicity.
Again, increased manganese in astroglial cells suppresses astroglial glutamate uptake with subsequent excitotoxic neuronal damage
Similarly, astrocytes appear as a primary target for other heavy metals, such as arsenic, lead and cadmium, which all reduce expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and trigger astroglial apoptosis, thus reducing astroglial homeostatic presence
In aluminium toxic encephalopathy (symptoms of which include cognitive deficits and speech alterations), astrocytes are again the main targets.
Aluminium accumulated by astrocytes impairs plasmalemmal glutamate transporters as well as gap junctions and causes astrocytic death
Likewise, astroglial loss through apoptotic death plays a leading role in the enchephalotoxic damage caused by cypermethrin, a synthetic II pyrethroid insecticide

Wernicke Encephalopathy
Wernicke encephalopathy is a pathoanatomical substrate for Korsakoff syndrome, symptoms of which include ante-and retrograde amnesia, apathy and confabulation
This type of encephalopathy is essentially rapidly progressing malignant thalamo-cortical neurodegeneration.
The pathological mechanism of Korsakoff-W-ernicke syndrome is primarily associated with acute failure in astroglial glutamate uptake resulting from ~60 to 70% decrease in expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 glutamate transporters.
This remarkable decrease in plasmalemmal glutamate transporters expression has been identified in postmortem human samples, as well as in the rat thiamine deficiency model of the disease
In addition to decrease in EAAT1/2 expression, astrocytes demonstrated signs of atrophy including decrease in GFAP morphological profiles, as well as decrease in expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) and GAT-3 GABA transporter.

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1)-Associated Dementia (HAD)
In the nervous system, the HIV-1 virus primarily infects and propagates in microglial cells.
Microglia contributes to neuronal death by releasing various neurotoxic factors
In HAD, astroglial cells develop both astrodegeneration and reactive astrogliosis.
In the basal ganglia, astrocytes undergo a serious loss with the degree of astroglial death correlated with the degree of cognitive impairments
In the entorhinal cortex and in the hippocampus, astrocytes show prominent reactivity

Non-AD Dementia
The non-AD dementia is represented by many disorders including fronto-temporal lobar degeneration, Pick's disease, Cockayne syndrome, juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Niemann-Pick type C disease.
Astroglial contribution to these disorders is complex with signs for astroglial atrophy and astroglial apoptotic death
In thalamic dementia, a profound astrogliosis likely represents a key pathophysiological factor
There is evidence indicating uncoupling of astroglial syncytium and aberrant activity of astroglial connexin hemichannels in JNCL

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
Astrocytes play fundamental role in the pathogenesis of hereditary familial ALS associated with the mutation of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1) gene.
In hSOD1/G93A, associated animal models of ALS astrocytes undergo atrophy, pathological remodelling loss of function and cell death.
These astroglial changes precede neuronal abnormalities and the emergence of clinical symptoms
The key pathogenetic factor linked to the neurotoxicity is represented by deficient astroglial glutamate uptake.
Selective silencing of hSOD1 gene in astrocytes in animal model delays ALS progression

Parkinson's Disease
The role of neuroglia in emergence and progression of Parkinson's disease remains to be fully elucidated.
There are some indications for microglial activation in relevant brain regions; this activation being possibly linked to neurotoxicity
This microglial response, however, can be secondary, being triggered by neuronal death
In 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) animal model of Parkinson's disease, inhibition of microglial activation was found to be neuroprotective
Astrocytes have been considered to provide neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurones, based on in vitro experiments
In primary neuronal-glial co-cultures, astrocytes were shown to convert L-DOPA, the immediate precursor of dopamine, from neurotoxic to neurotrophic substance, and hence astroglia can be crucial for L-DOPA substitute therapy

Astrocytes in Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease is characterised by progressive neurodegeneration and an occurrence of specific histopathological markers represented by (i) focal extracellular deposits of fibrillar β-amyloid (also called neuritic or senile plaques) in the brain parenchyma and in the walls of blood vessels, and by (ii) intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles composed from abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau filaments.
The initial neurodegenerative events in AD appear in the transentorhinal cortex, which subsequently spread to the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.
At later stages of the disease, the neurodegenerative process disseminates through the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes
At these late stages, the grey matter undergoes severe damage with a profound loss of neurones and synaptic contacts and generalised atrophy of the brain parenchyma; this atrophy includes both white and grey matters.
Contribution of neuroglia to the histopathology of Alzheimer's disease has been initially suggested by Alois Alzheimer himself; Fig.
The role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of AD remains to be fully characterised, primarily because of the lack of longitudinal studies assessing the status of astroglia at different stages of the disease.
From analyses of human post-mortem tissues, there has been generally agreed that at the late stages of the disease there are prominent reactive astrogliosis and inclusion of astrocytes into senile plaques

Astrocytes and β-Amyloid
The prevailing views on AD pathogenesis associate disease evolution with progressive accumulation of β-amyloid protein in the brain parenchyma and formation of senile plaques
Recently, however, the β-amyloid hypothesis became the subject of extensive criticism
Production of β-amyloid is mostly associated with neurones although there are several reports indicating the role of astrocytes in this process through either direct β-amyloid production or through deficient clearance.
Astroglial contribution to the clearance and degradation of β-amyloid has been suggested some 15 years ago
Reactive astrocytes associated with senile plaques in the transgenic AD mouse model expressing mutant APP were found to express a zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidase neprilysin, an enzyme capable of degrading β-amyloid
In experiments in vitro, cultured astroglial cells obtained from healthy mice were shown to accumulate exogenous β-amyloid.
In contrast, this ability was absent in astrocytes isolated from the brains of APP AD model
Similarly, astroglial β-amyloid accumulation was detected in cells from the entorhinal cortex of AD patients
Conversely, β-amyloid was almost never detected in astrocytes from 3xTg-AD mice
Astroglial contribution to β-amyloid production is not fully characterised.
Neurones, which express β-amyloid producing enzymes βand γ-secretases, were for a long time considered to be the main source for β-amyloid
Indeed, healthy astrocytes seem not to express βsecretase; nonetheless, its expression can be induced by conditions of chronic stress or neuroinflammatory environment, thus adding astroglia to amyloidogenesis
Expression of β-secretase was detected in reactive astrocytes emerging following immune lesion of cholinergic septohippocampal afferents or an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
Similarly, expression of β-secretase was found in reactive astrocytes in AD mice models expressing mutant human APP; these models, for example, included Tg2576, K670N-M671L APP or APP V717I mutations
Of note, an increase in production of APP was characterised in a rat model of chronic neocortical astrogliosis, induced by grafting a foetal cortical tissue in the midbrain of neonatal animals; these chronically activated astrocytes were immunopositive for APP, as well as for another AD-related marker apolipoprotein E4 [166].

Astrogliosis in AD
Astroglial reactivity, generally characterised by an increase in expressions of GFAP, vimentin or s100β protein, has been detected in post-mortem tissues from AD patients
No obvious correlation between GFAP levels, degree of astrogliosis and βamyloid load was detected
Similarly, no differences in GFAP expression were found between the brains obtained from cognitively sound and demented patients
Reactive, hypertrophic astrocytes, associated with senile plaques and perivascular β-amyloid deposits, are also observed in the brains of AD mice models
It is important to highlight that astrogliosis in AD is never associated with the scar formation and it does not hamper the physiological non-overlap of astroglial territorial domains.
It can be classified therefore as isomorphic or mild astrogliotic response.
In the context of AD, the astrogliotic response can be triggered by various molecules, such as β-amyloid, molecules released from damaged cells or certain cytokines and chemokines.
Soluble β-amyloid was found to initiate reactive astrogliosis in astrocytes in vitro
This may be associated with certain intracellular signalling events, including, for example, Ca 2+ signals.
Such signals are indeed generated by exposure of cultured astrocytes to β-amyloid
Treatment of cultured astrocytes with β-amyloid also resulted in inhibition of glutamate uptake, which can contribute to pathological progression

Astroglial Atrophy in AD
Pathological changes of astrocytes in the AD pathology are not limited to astrogliotic response; it seems that astrogliosis occurs at later stages of the disease, with reactive astrocytes being mainly associated with senile plaques.
Recent studies of transgenic AD mice models revealed a profound astrodegeneration that occurs at the early stages of AD progression
Total number of astrocytes (labelled with antibodies against GFAP, s100β or GS) did not show any age-dependent variations in 3xTg-AD mice of 3-24 months of age
There are complex region-and disease stage-specific morphological changes in astrocytes in 3xTg-AD mice
At the early (i.e.
pre-plaque) stages of the AD, astrocytes in the entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus demonstrate signs of morphological atrophy
Astroglial atrophy develops first in the entorhinal cortex (from 1 month of age, Fig.
Atrophy of GFAP-positive profiles preceded β-amyloid deposition and formation of senile plaques.
The reduction in GFAP profiles coincided with the reduced morphological presence of astroglial cells labelled with GS antibodies in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the entorhinal cortex.
Morphological atrophy of astrocytes was manifested by reduced expression of GFAP-rich cytoskeleton (surface and volume coverage) and decreased somata volume, as well as number and branching of cell processes.
Very similar atrophic changes were observed in hippocampal astrocytes from another AD animal model, the mutant APP (PDAPP-J20) mice carrying the Swedish and Indiana APP human mutations
Astroglial atrophy was subsequently confirmed in human material, in astrocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells isolated from patients with family and sporadic
At the later stages of AD pathology in hippocampi of 3xTG-AD animals
Numerous hypertrophic astrocytes accumulate exclusively around senile plaques and β-amyloid inundated blood vessels
This astroglial hypertrophy is characterised by an increased volume and surface of both astrocyte somata and processes, which can increase their size up to
At the same time, astrocytes positioned away from the senile plaques retain their atrophic morphology
In contrast to the hippocampus, accu mulation of β-amyloid and formation of senile plaques do not induce reactivity of astrocytes neither in the entorhinal nor in the prefrontal cortex
Deficient reactivity of astrocytes may determine the specific vulnerability of different brain regions to AD-type pathology.
Atrophy of astrocytes at the early stages of AD may have important functional consequences.
The decrease in astroglial complexity may affect synaptic coverage and homoeostatic support as well as functional performance of the neuronal-glial-vascular unit.
This in turn can affect connectivity in neural network, reduce synaptic strength and disturb synaptic plasticity thus contributing to cognitive deficits.

Loss of Astroglial Homeostatic Support Contributes to Early Cognitive Impairments
Atrophic changes in astrocytes, characterised in several AD animal models as well as in stem cells derived astrocytes appear as general diminution of astroglial territories, of astroglial coverage of neuronal membranes and overall decrease in astroglial homeostatic support.
Arguably, this atrophy and loss of function of astrocytes, which occur early in the disease progression, may contribute to the disease pathophysiology.
Atrophic astrocytes provide less synaptic coverage with deleterious consequences for synaptic transmission associated with compromised ion and neurotransmitter homeostasis or reduced local metabolic support; astroglial asthenia also results in decreased neuroprotection
All these changes are likely to weaken synaptic transmission and affect synaptic plasticity, thereby being responsible for initial cognitive deficiency observed at the early stages of AD.
Early cognitive deficits are the very first symptoms of AD, which start to emerge decades before the occurrence of specific histopathology
Loss or impairment of cognitive capacities reflects reduced synaptic connectivity due to decreased synaptic function and synaptic loss
Decrease in number of synapses indeed was found to be the earliest morphological change in AD
Atrophy of astroglial perisynaptic processes may indeed underlie synaptic loss at the early stages of AD.
Furthermore, astrocytes are fundamental for synaptogenesis and synaptic maintenance; furthermore, astroglial plasmalemmal transporters control local concentrations of ions and neurotransmitters, most notably glutamate, that may contribute to local excitotoxicity
Astroglial asthenia also impairs metabolic support accomplished by lactate shuttle
Astrocytes are also critical for maintaining normal neurotransmission by supplying neurones with glutamine that is an indispensable precursor for both glutamate and GABA.
Impairment of all these fundamental functions associated with astroglial atrophy and loss of function may be considered as a primary cause for distorted synaptic connectivity and early cognitive deficits in AD

Neurovascular Unit in AD
Clinical evolution of AD is almost invariably associated with vascular deficiency and pathologies of the blood-brain barrier
It is well documented that the blood flow is significantly reduced in the brains of patients with AD, with these vascular deficits being prominent already at the early stages of the disease
These functional deficits stem from substantial remodelling of vascularisation in the brains altered by AD pathology
Brain vessels are controlled by both neuronal and astroglial inputs
Astrocytes are central integrating elements of neurovascular units that bridge brain parenchyma with local circulation.
By secreting various agents astrocytes target pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, thus contributing to functional hyperaemia and regulating the blood-brain barrier
Astroglial atrophy as well as reactivity may differentially remodel the neurovascular unit, even that can occur at both early and late stages of the disease and can contribute to cognitive abnormalities and neuronal damage.

AD and Astroglial Metabolic Support
Metabolic deficiency of the brain is a common feature of AD.
Functional brain imaging demonstrated a progressive loss of utilisation of glucose in patients with different stages of AD; deficits in brain metabolism are present already at the very early stages of the disease, having thus diagnostic significance
Exposure of cultured astrocytes to β-amyloid impairs cellular metabolism, although both decrease
Likewise, both decrease

Deficient Astroglial Reactivity Defines Susceptibility of Brain Tissue to AD Pathology
Astroglial atrophy and asthenia in AD also lead to a loss of their defensive function
As has been alluded previously, in experiments on 3xTg-AD mice, reactive astrocytes were accumulated around senile plaques and form perivascular β-amyloid deposits
These hypertrophic astrocytes are specifically associated with extracellular β-amyloid deposits, whereas astrocytes distant to the plaques remain atrophic (so in this sense astroglial atrophy emerges at the early stages of AD and is complimented by astrogliosis at later stages, when specific lesions develop).
In contrast, in entorhinal and prefrontal cortices, extracellular β-amyloid accumulation does not trigger astrogliotic response
There are several lines of evidence demonstrating that reactive astrocytes are neuroprotective in the context of AD.
For example, the Tg2576 mice (that harbour the APP Swe mutationsee
Furthermore, senile plaques in these animals are resembling human β-amyloid deposit being represented by fleecy, granular, cored and diffused amyloid plaques [336], Incidentally, the Tg2576 mice display certain similarities with the prodromal stage of AD known in humans as mild cognitive impairment
Astroglial capabilities to mount astrogliotic response change with age.
The density of reactive astrocytes changes with age.
In old Tg2576 mice, GFAP staining demonstrated prevalence of atrophic astrocytes with fewer reactive astroglial cells, which may be related with increased AD pathology in ageing
Inhibition of reactive astrogliosis in the AD mouse model significantly increased β-amyloid load and exacerbated pathological progression
The in vivo brain imaging of astrocytes uses PET detection of 11 C-deuterium-L-deprenyl ( 11 C-DED) that binds to MAO-B in the astrocytes
When using a multi-tracer PET detecting 11 C-PIB (marker of fibrillar β-amyloid), 18 F-FDG (marker cerebral glucose metabolism) and 11 C-DED (marker of astrogliosis), the highest binding of 11 C-DED (which reflects maximal reactivity of astrocytes) was observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and high levels of fibrillar amyloid plaques in the brain (PIB+) reflecting prodromal AD
Decrease in astroglial reactivity parallels the switch from MCI to fullblown AD with senile dementia again demonstrating the neuroprotective role of astrogliotic remodelling

Astroglial Calcium Signalling in AD 11.6.1 Ionic Signalling as a Substrate of Astroglial Excitability
Astroglial excitability is based on spatially and temporally controlled fluctuations of intracellular concentration of ions, most notably of Ca 2+ and Na + , although recently the signalling role for K + and Cl -begun to be considered
Astroglial Ca 2+ signalling is the most studied; astroglial Ca 2+ responses have been discovered in the late 1980s
Physiological stimulation has been demonstrated to trigger Ca 2+ signals in astrocytes in vitro, in situ and in vivo
Astroglial calcium signalling has a spatiotemporal hierarchical organisation: at the cellular level, astrocytic Ca 2+ signals are classified into local Ca 2+ microdomains, intracellular propagating waves, global Ca 2+ signals and Ca 2+ oscillations
These distinct forms of Ca 2+ signals reflect operation of different mechanisms.
Global Ca 2+ signals and propagating Ca 2+ waves originate from Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ store; this release is primarily mediated by inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP 3 ) receptor type 2, (InsP 3 R2).
Local Ca 2+ microdomains in contrast are often generated by Ca 2+ entry through ionotropic receptors, transient receptor potential channels, store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) or reversed Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger
Astroglial Ca 2+ signals regulate several cellular processes, including secretion, metabolism and astroglial reactivity.
Astroglial Na + signalling is much less characterised, although basic parameters of Na + transients evoked by physiological stimulation have been described in experiments in cultured cells and in astrocytes in brain slices
Astroglial Na + signals regulate many homeostatic plasmalemmal transporters, thus coordinating neuronal activity with astroglial support

Aberrant Calcium Signalling in AD
The fundamental role of Ca 2+ in regulation of cellular survival and cell death inspired the "calcium hypothesis of ageing and neurodegeneration" formulated by Zaven Khachatirian
This Ca 2+ hypothesis posits that ageing neurones experience increased Ca 2+ influx during depolarisation, which elevates cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ), thus triggering excitotoxicity.
Subsequent studies revealed that physiological neuronal ageing is associated with much subtle alterations of neuronal Ca 2+ extrusion, which, although capable of handling normal Ca 2+ loads, fail to clear excessive Ca 2+ influx.
This deficit in Ca 2+ handling stipulates higher vulnerability of old neurones to the periods of high activity
In neurodegenerative diseases (including AD), Ca 2+ homeostatic machinery is, however, seriously compromised, and hence these disorders have been regarded as "chronic calciumopathies"
Almost nothing is known about changes in Ca 2+ homeostatic machinery, resting Ca 2+ handling, and Ca 2+ signalling in aged astrocytes.
There are several isolated reports demonstrating a decrease in evoked astrocytic Ca 2+ signals in mice aged

Exposure to β-Amyloid Disturbs Astroglial Ca 2+ Signalling
Whether β-amyloid is indeed a causal factor in AD or a mere epiphenomenon, exposure to it affects astroglial Ca 2+ dynamics.
Experimental studies in vitro in primary astroglial cultures demonstrated acute effects of β-amyloid on Ca 2+ signalling.
Resting [Ca 2+ ] i significantly
These findings, however, have not been universally confirmed; several investigations found that incubations of cultured astrocytes with 100-200 nM of β-amyloid (or its toxic fragment β-amyloid25-35) for 48-72 h did not significantly change resting [Ca 2+ ] i
Acute exposure to β-amyloid triggered oscillations of [Ca 2+ ] i transients in cultured astrocytes and in astrocytes in organotypic slices
These acute effects, however, were not always observed and several studies have not noticed such acute effects
Treatment of cultured astrocytes with 1 μM of β-amyloid 1 -40 induced [Ca 2+ ] i elevations only in 17% of all the cells, whereas application of β-amyloid25-35 triggered Ca 2+ signals in 36% of all astrocytes
In primary cultured rat newborn astrocytes, application of 1 μM of β-amyloid25-35 induced [Ca 2+ ] i transients in 27% of primary cultured rat newborn astrocytes; at 2-5 μM ~60% of astrocytes responded with [Ca 2+ ] i transients
Of note, low concentrations of β-amyloid apparently stimulate astroglial Ca 2+ -permeable α7 nicotinic cholinoreceptors, which resulted in Ca 2+ influx and generation of Ca 2+ responses

Pathological Ca 2+ Signalling in AD Astrocytes In Vitro
Analysis of [Ca 2+ ] i dynamics in astrocytes isolated from several mouse models of AD also demonstrated aberrant Ca 2+ signalling
Abnormally large Ca 2+ signals have been detected in astrocytes isolated from newborn 3xTg-AD mice, indicating intrinsic alterations of Ca 2+ homeostatic cascades
Astrocytes isolated from 3xTg-AD mice in particular showed increased store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)
Cultures of astrocytes isolated from 3xTg-AD animals also demonstrated aberrant kinetics of ATP-induced Ca 2+ signals and Ca 2+ oscillations
Further analysis revealed that these aberrations are most likely associated with expression of mutant PS1 presenilins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum
In the Tg5469 AD mouse which over-expressed APP, the SOCE was not changed, whereas deletion of APP caused an inhibition of store-operated Ca 2+ entry [164].
This inhibition may be associated with down-regulation of expression of either TRPC1 or Orai 1 channels.

Pathological Ca 2+ Signalling in Astrocytes In Vivo
Imaging astroglial [Ca 2+ ] i dynamics in vivo in the brains of AD animal models reliably demonstrated aberrant, hyperactive [Ca 2+ ] i dynamics, which is fundamentally similar to neuronal hyperexcitability routinely observed in AD-like experimental pathology
Aberrant hyperactive [Ca 2+ ] i oscillations have been observed in reactive astrocytes associated with senile plaques.
High levels of resting [Ca 2+ ] i , pathological Ca 2+ oscillations and long-projecting propagating Ca 2+ waves have been identified in plaque-associated astrocytes in the brains of APP/PS1 mice
Emergence of astroglial Ca 2+ hyperactivity was also suggested to be linked with abnormal purinergic signalling in reactive astrocytes.
There are claims that reactive astrocytes release excessive amounts of ATP through connexin hemichannels.
This ATP, acting in autocrine manner, activates astroglial P2Y purinoceptors, which mediate pathological Ca 2+ signalling
An increased frequency of astroglial Ca 2+ oscillations was also observed in AD animals in the pre-plaque stage, and these abnormal [Ca 2+ ] i dynamics coincided with the instability of vascular tone probably indicating that astrocytes in their ability to regulate local blood flow

Astroglial Ca 2+ Signalling Toolkit Is Remodelled in AD
The AD as a chronic pathology leads to a substantial remodelling of astroglial Ca 2+ signalling toolkit.
Chronic exposure of cultured astrocytes to β-amyloid as well in vivo AD pathology (in model animals) changes expression of various components of Ca 2+ homeostatic/signalling system; these molecules include, for example, metabotropic and ionotropic receptors, intracellular Ca 2+ channels, store-operated Ca 2+ channels and Ca 2+ sensors
Exposure of astroglial cultures to 10-30 μM β-amyloid 1-40 for 48-72 h resulted in an increase of the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] i transients in response to stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5.
This augmentation of metabotropic Ca 2+ signalling was a consequence of an up-regulated expression of mGluR5 detected at both mRNA and protein levels
This was corroborated in another series of experiments which demonstrated that 24-72 h exposure of cultured astrocytes to 100 nM-20 μM of oligomeric β-amyloid increased expression of mGluR5
This up-regulation of mGluR5 expression was suppressed by the inhibitors of calcineurin and Nf-κB (nuclear factor κ-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells)
Similar increase in expression of mGluR5 was detected in astrocytes in the animal AD models and in post-mortem human tissues.
Increased levels of mGluR5 protein were found in the post-mortem hippocampal preparations obtained from AD patients at advanced (Braak V-VI) stages of the disease
Incubation of astrocytes with nanomolar (0.1-100 nM) concentrations of β-amyloid 1-42 for 24-72 h increased the expression of several subunits of nicotinic cholinoreceptors including α7nAChR, α 4nAChR and β2nAChR
Similarly, increased levels of α7nAChR were identified in the post-mortem brain tissue of patients with sporadic AD and familial AD associated with the Swedish APP mutation
Another important class of molecules affected by AD progression is represented by intracellular Ca 2+ release channels.
Exposure of cultured astrocytes to 125 nM of Tat-ProADAM10709-729 peptide (this peptide inhibits production of β-amyloid 1-40 and β-amyloid 1-42 ) for 72 h leads to an increased expression of InsP 3 R1
Sim ilarly, upregulation of expression of InsP 3 R1 and InsP 3 R2 mRNA was detected in astrocytes in vitro which were exposed to 100 nM oligomeric β-amyloid 1-42
Pathological remodelling of Ca 2+ homeostatic and signalling cascades differ between different brain regions.
Expression of InsP3R1 is increased in healthy hippocampal astrocytes exposed to βamyloid, but remains unchanged in astrocytes from the entorhinal cortex
However, βamyloid did not affect expression of InsP 3 R1 in astrocytes isolated from 3xTg-AD animals, indicating that exogenous β-amyloid and over-expression of mutated AD-related genes share common molecular pathways that cause deregulation of Ca 2+ homeostasis.
In post-mortem studies, however, generalised decrease in the expression of InsP 3 Rs was detected in all brain regions including frontal, parietal and entorhinal cortices and the hippocampus
These studies did not, however, discriminate between cell types.
Many other components of Ca 2+ signalling system are affected by AD; these include components calpain-10
All in all 32 genes associated with Ca 2+ signalling were found to be affected in the transcriptome of astrocytes microdissected from patients with different Braak stages of AD.
It appeared that expression of several isoforms of calmodulin kinase CaMKII, two isoforms of calmodulin, plasma membrane Ca 2+ -ATPases, ryanodine receptors and InsP3Rs, was decreased at advanced (Braak V-VI) stage when compared with early (Braak I-II) stage of the disease [262].

Ca 2+ Release and Astroglial Reactivity
As has been alluded before, astrogliosis is a prominent component in certain brain regions in the context of AD; reactive astrocytes associate themselves with senile plaques in human tissue and in the brains of AD animal models, arguably forming a defensive barrier protecting neural networks
Suppression of astrogliotic response (for instance, by genetic deletion of GFAP and vimentin) exacerbates β-amyloid load and facilitates plaques dissemination
Astroglial reactivity, however, is different in different regions of the brain.
Prominent astroglial reactivity is observed in the hippocampus, whereas the emergence of senile plaques and β-amyloid depositions does not trigger astrogliosis in entorhinal and prefrontal cortices of AD mice models.
Underlying molecular mechanisms might be linked to a deficient Ca 2+ signalling in astrocytes from different brain regions.
In the AD context, one of the most relevant signals instigating astroglial reactivity is βamyloid, and indeed exposure of astroglia to β-amyloid in vitro or in situ triggers astrogliosis
As has been described above, β-amyloid also evokes [Ca 2+ ] i elevation.
It appears that β-amyloid-induced Ca 2+ signals originate from Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ store and these Ca 2+ signals are directly linked to the initiation of astrogliotic response.
Suppression of Ca 2+ release from the ER with pharmacological tools effectively inhibits astrogliosis induced by β-amyloid in both cultured astrocytes and astroglia in organotypic slices
The causal role of Ca 2+ release in astroglial reactivity was directly demonstrated: deletion of InsP 3 R2 effectively suppressed astrogliotic activation
Sensitivity of astrocytes from different brain regions to β-amyloid is different: βamyloid up-regulates expression of molecules providing for ER Ca 2+ release in hippocampal but not in entorhinal astrocytes
This may explain the absence of astrogliotic defensive response in astrocytes from cortical regions, which renders these parts of the brain vulnerable to the AD pathology

AD Pathology Affects Astroglial Vesicular Trafficking and Secretion
Astrocytes are secretory cells, being a part of CNS-wide "gliocrine" system
Astrocytes are known to secrete ~200 molecules, many of which are released through exocytosis of secretory vesicles
Intracellular astroglial vesicles are also fundamental for delivery of various molecules [298] such as ion channels, membrane receptors and transporters, as well as major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II,
Vesicular traffic is controlled by sophisticated molecular cascades, which in turn are regulated by increases in [Ca 2+ ] i
Changes in [Ca 2+ ] i differentially regulate motility of distinct vesicles types.
Increases in [Ca 2+ ] i reduce the motility of vesicles carrying peptides, such as atrial natriuretic peptide, while accelerating motility of vesicles containing vesicular L-glutamate transporter VGLUT1
Proteolytic enzymes stored in endolysosomes may contribute to the development of AD.
One of these proteases is represented by the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which, when secreted into the extracellular space, may degrade β-amyloid.
Astrocytes are the main cell type which produces and releases IDE
It has been hypothesised that in AD the capacity of secreting IDE is reduced, leading to an increase in β-amyloid, which involves a reduction in autophagy-based lysosomal secretion of IDE
Astrocytes from 3xTg-AD mice demonstrated an aberrant vesicular traffic.
Spontaneous mobility of peptidergic and endolysosomal vesicles as well as the ATP-evoked, Ca 2+dependent, vesicle mobility was all diminished in AD astrocytes
Transfection of healthy rat astrocytes to express familial AD-associated mutated presenilin 1 (PS1M146V) caused very similar impairment of peptidergic vesicle trafficking.
The stimulation-dependent peptide secretion from single vesicles was less efficient in 3xTg-AD and PS1M146Vexpressing astrocytes than in healthy controls.
The impaired vesicle dynamics and reduced evoked secretion of the signalling peptides both may contribute to the development of AD

GABAergic Astrocytes in AD
In the healthy young CNS, astrocytes contribute to GABAergic transmission through (i) supplying glutamine, needed for GABA biosynthesis in neuronal terminals and (ii) removing ~20% of all released GABA by dedicated plasmalemmal transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3.
After being transported into the astrocytes, most of GABA is catabolised by GABA transaminase (GABA-T) to succinate, which is subsequently utilised for production of ATP
Due to this energy-oriented catabolism, the concentration of GABA in the cytosol of astrocytes is rather low.
Ageing and neurodegeneration, however, significantly affect astroglial GABA metabolism; concentration of GABA in astrocytes in elderly
This increase is particularly prominent in reactive astrocytes associated with senile plaques in AD animal models; intracellular GABA concentration in these AD reactive astrocytes is several times higher than in age-matched controls and is very similar to neuronal GABA content
These changes in astrocytic GABA content in reactive astrocytes are accompanied with an up-regulation of expression of GABA producing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD67 as well as with an increase in expression of astroglia-specific monoaminoxidase-B (MAO-B)
At the same time, expression of glutamine synthetase is specifically down-regulated in reactive astrocytes surrounding senile plaques in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of 3xTg-AD mice
Thus reactive astrocytes acquire machinery to synthetase GABA either from glutamate (through GAD67 and increased glutamate availability due to the loss of glutamine synthetase) or from putrescine through MAO-B pathway
Furthermore, there is an increased glutamatergic neuronal activity around senile plaques
The emergence of GABAergic astrocytes may represent yet another defensive response; as GABA release from astroglia may counteract neuronal hyperexcitability by an increase of tonic inhibition

Astrocytes as Therapeutic Targets in AD
Neuroglia is yet to be considered as a fundamental target for novel therapeutic agents for neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in particular.
It is conceivable that by modulating the status of astrocytes, by reversing or halting astrocytes degeneration and asthenia or by modulating astroglial reactivity, the course of AD can be altered and the disease can be delayed or cognitive alterations reversed.
Several possible strategies that may affect astroglial pathology have recently emerged.

Lifestyle Changes May Reverse Astrodegeneration
Recent experiments have demonstrated that environmental modifications such as sensory stimulation, dieting or usage of food supplements may affect AD progression and at the same time change astroglia morphology and revert astroglial atrophy.
Experiments on APP and 3xTg-AD mice models revealed that chronic exposure of these animals to physical activity and/or to enriched environment reversed morphological atrophy of astrocytes, increased GFAP expression and normalised GFAP-positive astroglial profiles (Fig.
Incidentally, environmental stimulation also improved neurogenesis which is impaired in the AD
Another AD model, the 5xFAD mice chronically treated with polyunsatu-rated fatty acid 2-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid similarly rescued astroglial atrophy, restored adult neurogenesis and improved cognitive performance
Treatment with specific diets may also affect ageing and AD progression.
It is well appreciated that caloric restriction exerts prominent positive effect of lifespan of several species and may boost cognitive resilience of the brain
It appeared that caloric restriction induces growth of astroglial perisynaptic processes, thus extending synaptic coverage, preventing glutamate spillover, improving K + buffering and glu tamate uptake from the synaptic cleft, thus ultimately enhancing synaptic plasticity

Preventing Neurodegeneration by Adrenergic Astroglial Excitation
Noradrenergic innervation of the CNS is provided by projections of adrenergic neurones localised in the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus.
This small nucleus is located near the fourth ventricle and, in humans, comprises around 50,000 neurones
Diffuse innervation by projections of locus coeruleus neurones reaches practically all parts of the brain and the spinal cord
The locus coeruleus neurones are vulnerable to oxidative stress; apparently, they are lost in ageing and they are first to die during neurodegeneration including AD
Astrocytes, being universally sensitive to noradrenaline, represent the major target for deficient noradrenergic innervation and interfering with astroglial adrenergic mechanisms may be therapeutically relevant
Astroglial sensitivity to noradrenaline, released from locus coeruleus neuronal projections, is mediated by both αand β-adrenoceptors linked, respectively, to cytosolic Ca 2+ signalling
In the in vivo experiments in the awake mice, the vast majority of astrocytes generated synchronous [Ca 2+ ] i signals in response to noradrenaline released from locus coeruleus projections
This difference reflects upon much higher density of adrenoceptors in astrocytes when compared to neurones
Degeneration of locus coeruleus neurones associated with ageing most certainly impairs adrenoceptors-medicated astroglial excitability, which may be linked to the cognitive decline
Consequently, preventing death of locus coeruleus neurones or boosting astroglial adrenergic excitability may represent a valid therapeutic strategy
Alternative possibilities may involve drugs, such as deprenyl, that limit noradrenaline catabolism in astrocytes.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used with positive effects including memory enhancements, accelerated motor function rehabilitation, alleviation of depressive symptoms and decelerated progression of cognitive impairments in AD patients
The mechanism of action of tDCS is astroglial and noradrenergic.
It has been revealed that tDCS induces a massive increase in astroglial [Ca 2+ ] i which has been suppressed by the ablation of noradrenergic neurones or by the inhibition of α 1 -adrenoceptors
Alternative possibilities may involve drugs that limit noradrenaline catabolism in astrocytes such as, for example, deprenil.

Conclusions
Astroglial contributions to the pathophysiology of AD are complex and range from early astroglial atrophy, which limits homeostatic support and may cause synaptic weakness and early cognitive decline, to astroglial reactivity, which seems to protect the CNS against ADassociated pathology and limits the spread of β-amyloid load.
Astroglia may also undergo pathological remodelling, in which astrocytes may acquire new functions such as, for example, secreting GABA.
Specific manipulations with astroglia may represent a valid therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders including AD.         x, where a = 17.88±0.00
