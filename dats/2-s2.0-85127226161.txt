Forsythoside A Mitigates Alzheimer's-like Pathology by Inhibiting Ferroptosis-mediated Neuroinflammation via Nrf2/GPX4 Axis Activation
Ferroptosis and neuroinflammation play crucial roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology.
Forsythoside A (FA), the main constituent of Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.)
Vahl., possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties.
The present study aimed to investigate the potential role of FA in AD neuropathology using male APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice, Aβ1-42-exposed N2a cells, erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and LPS-induced BV2 cells.
FA treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function and inhibited lipid peroxidation in Aβ1-42-exposed N2a cells.
In LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, FA treatment decreased the formation of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, and NO.
In male APP/PS1 mice, FA treatment ameliorated memory and cognitive impairments and suppressed Aβ deposition and p-tau levels in the brain.
Analyses using proteomics, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and western blot revealed that FA treatment significantly augmented dopaminergic signaling, inhibited iron deposition and lipid peroxidation, prevented the activation of IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, and promoted the production of anti-inflammatory factors in the brain.
FA treatment exerted anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects in erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and the Nrf2/GPX4 axis played a key role in these effects.
Collectively, these results demonstrate the protective effects of FA and highlight its therapeutic potential as a drug component for AD treatment.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia
The pathophysiological processes underscoring AD are thought to begin 20 years or more prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms [2], which negatively impact patients' health and place a substantial economic burden on individuals, families, and society
In 2019, the oligosaccharide GV-971 was approved for the treatment of mild and moderate AD in China and was assessed in an international phase III clinical trial in April 2020
In June 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved aducanumab, co-developed by Biogen and Eisai, for the treatment of AD
Despite these encouraging findings, the pathological mechanisms underlying AD remain unclear, which precludes the development of more effective treatments
Iron deposits are observed in plaques, microglia, and tangle-bearing neurons in the AD brain
Iron is a key component of ferroptosis, which is defined as the accumulation of lethal lipid substances produced by lipid peroxidation.
Ferroptosis has emerged as a major process in AD pathophysiology
Previous studies have demonstrated that almost all genes related to ferroptosis are regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription, including, but not limited to, nicotinamide adenine Ivyspring International Publisher dinucleotide phosphate, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and iron-regulated genes
As a member of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase family, GPX4 has the unique function of reducing hydroperoxide in membrane lipids
This property of reducing phospholipid hydroperoxide, thus inhibiting lipoxygenase-mediated lipid peroxidation, underscores its vital role in preventing ferroptosis
Nevertheless, the role of Nrf2/GPX4 in AD remains poorly understood.
In addition to ferroptosis, brain tissue is particularly vulnerable to neuroinflammation, which can aggravate amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and tau phosphorylation
Ferroptosis is associated with neuroinflammation, suggesting that iron retention can trigger microglial activation and interleukin (IL)-1β production in AD
Additionally, the Nrf2 pathway inhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related nuclear factor-κB (NF-ĸB) activation by preventing the degradation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IĸB)-α
As a downstream target of Nrf2, GPX4 prevents tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated activation of NF-ĸB.
Correspondingly, neuroinflammation is suppressed via inhibition of ferroptosis
Although ferroptosis inhibitors are considered as key regulators of neuroinflammation, the role of Nrf2/GPX4 in the regulation of the NF-ĸB signaling pathway in AD has yet to be elucidated.
Forsythoside A (FA) (3,4-dihydroxy-βphenethyl-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-4-O-caffeo yl-β-D-glucopyranoside) (Fig.
Vahl (F.
suspensa or Lianqiao in Chinese), which was first recorded in Shen Nong's Herbology, the earliest extant treatise in Chinese pharmacological literature
FA possesses various beneficial pharmacological characteristics, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective properties
Oral administration of FA was reported to decrease the number of microglia and astrocytes in transient cerebral global ischemia in gerbils
Further, FA treatment attenuated neuroinflammation and apoptosis caused by Aβ in hippocampal slices
However, the effects of FA treatment on ferroptosis in AD have not been reported to date.
In this study, we explored the effects of FA treatment on AD neuropathology in male APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice, Aβ1-42-exposed N2a cells, erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 cells in order to identify its mechanism of action.

Materials and methods

Animals and ethical statement
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Jilin University (permit No. SY201905013) and were conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Eight-month-old B6C3-Tg (APPswePSEN1dE9)/Nju double transgenic male mice (APP/PS1) (genotype: (Appswe) T, (Psen1) T) and age-matched wild-type (WT) (genotype: (Appswe) W, (Psen1) W) male mice were purchased from Nanjing Biomedical Research Institute of Nanjing University.
All mice were individually housed at 24 °C with food and drinking water available ad libitum.
After 1 week of adaption in the new environment, WT mice received oral administration of normal saline (10 mL/kg) and were designated as the control group (n = 12).
APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into two groups: the model group (n = 12) received oral administration of normal saline (10 mL/kg) and the agent-treated group (n = 12) received oral treatment with 30 mg/kg FA (L-012-171216, 98.83% purity, Chengdu Herbpurify Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China) beginning on day 8.
After 30-day treatment, behavioral experiments were serially performed.
The entire treatment protocol lasted for 42 days.
Blood samples were collected from the caudal vein.
After euthanasia via CO2 inhalation, organs including the brain, liver, spleen, and kidney were collected for further analysis (Fig.

Behavioral tests

Y-maze test
Working memory was evaluated using the Y-maze test.
The Y-maze comprised three arms (dimensions of each arm: 30 cm × 6 cm × 30 cm), including one start arm and two objective arms.
After 3-day training, the mice were fasted for 12 h prior to the formal test.
On day 41, the mice were individually placed at the end of the start arm, and food was placed in one of the two objective arms.
The movement trajectory of each mouse and time spent searching for food were recorded with a camera and analyzed using Any-maze software (Stoelting Co., Chicago, IL, USA) under the condition of researchers blinded to treatment groups.

Morris water maze (MWM) test
Spatial memory and navigation ability were evaluated using the MWM test on day 43.
Both training and formal testing were performed using an MT-200 water labyrinth video-tracking analysis system (MT-200, TECHMAN Software Co., Ltd., Chengdu, China).
The cistern was divided into four quadrants.
Titanium dioxide was added to the cistern to make the water turbid.
During training, the mice were placed in the water to reach the platform within 60 s.
After finding the platform, the mice stayed on the platform for 20 s.
The mice that did not find the platform within 60 s were manually led to the platform and stayed there for 20 s.
After 3 days of training, the navigation test and probe trial were performed under blinded conditions on days 46 and 47, respectively.

After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, proteins were precipitated using acetone.
The samples were then resuspended and mixed with trypsin, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and then desalted after the removal of sodium deoxycholate.
A volume of 2 μL of polypeptide was analyzed using nano ultra-performance liquid chromatography (EASY-nLC1200) coupled with Q-Exactive mass spectrometry (Thermo Finnigan).
MaxQuant (Version 1.5.6.0) was used to analyze the raw MS files.
The protein sequence database was obtained from UniProt (Uniprot_mouse_2016_09). Significantly differentially expressed proteins were defined as proteins with a content ratio between the two groups (WT group/APP/PS1 group or FA-treated APP/PS1 group/APP/PS1 group) of > 1.5 or < 0.66.
These differentially expressed proteins were subjected to cluster analysis, protein interaction analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis.

Results

FA treatment protected cells against Aβ 1-42 and LPS-induced injury
Aβ is thought to promote neuronal death by damaging mitochondria, aggravating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress
Inflammation of the central nervous system is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Microglia own an important position and number in neuronal cell populations in the brain region and are activated during neuroinflammation
In this study, the classic preclinical AD models of Aβ1-42-induced N2a cells and LPS-induced BV2 microglia were used to explore the neuroprotective effects of FA.
FA treatment dose-dependently improved cell viability (p < 0.001) (Fig.
LPS has been reported to induce inflammation in microglia
In LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, FA treatment dose-dependently reduced NO (p < 0.001) (Fig.

FA treatment ameliorated AD-like symptoms in APP/PS1 mice
Six-week FA administration suppressed the high index levels in the liver (p < 0.001) (Fig.
No evident pathological changes were observed in the liver (Fig.
In the Y-maze test, the foraging time of APP/PS1 mice was longer than that of WT mice (p < 0.001).
In contrast, foraging time was shortened after FA administration in APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.001) (Fig.
Memory and spatial recognition abilities of mice were assessed using the MWM.
In APP/PS1 mice, FA treatment shortened the escape latency in the navigation test (p < 0.05) (Fig.
Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangles formed by highly phosphorylated tau protein are considered the two major pathological hallmarks of AD
Compared with vehicle treatment, FA treatment strongly suppressed Aβ deposition (Fig.
These data suggested that FA treatment ameliorated AD-like symptoms in APP/PS1 mice.

FA treatment augmented dopaminergic signaling and prevented ferroptosis in APP/PS1 mice
Label-free proteomics was performed to screen proteins that were significantly differentially expressed among WT, APP/PS1, and FA-treated APP/PS1 mice.
The analysis identified 15 proteins with significantly different expression (Fig.
GO analysis detected cyclase activity, cAMPmediated signaling, and dopamine (DA) receptor signaling pathways (Fig.
KEGG analysis revealed that significantly differentially expressed proteins were associated with dopaminergic synapses (Fig.
As a key neurotransmitter in the nervous system, DA prevents ferroptosis by reducing iron accumulation and degrading GPX4 in cells
DA receptors inhibit NF-κB activity via the protein phosphatase 2A-dependent protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, thereby inhibiting inflammation
Based on biosynthesis, the relationships among the 15 significant proteins, ferroptosis-related proteins, and neuroinflammation-related proteins are presented in the STRING interaction analysis (Fig.
To further verify the proteomics results, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression levels of cAMP, p-AKT, and GPX4 in the mouse brain.
The expression of cAMP (p < 0.01) (Fig.
Proteins related to the dopaminergic system and ferroptosis were analyzed.
Compared with vehicletreated APP/PS1 mice, FA-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited higher levels of dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) (a family of dopamine receptors that lead to protein kinase A (PKA) activation
These proteins are all related to the regulation of the dopaminergic system.
Further, FA treatment increased the expression levels of p-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) (a protein that is essential for the formation of hippocampal-dependent long-term memory
Nrf2 signaling can protect dopaminergic neurons against ferroptosis
Compared with vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice, FA-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited reduced phosphorylation of Fyn (its phosphorylated form accumulates in the nucleus and phosphorylates Nrf2 at tyrosine 568
FA treatment strongly suppressed the expression of transferrin receptor (TFRC) (a membrane receptor that mediates Fe 3+ transport into cells

FA treatment mitigated neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice
In AD, neuroinflammation aggravates Aβ and tau pathology
The release of lipid metabolites in ferroptosis triggers inflammation, which reciprocally promotes ferroptosis by increasing iron deposition
FA treatment strongly suppressed the expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) (a microglial marker
Double-labeling with GFAP and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) further confirmed the inhibitory effect of FA treatment on the activation of astrocytes (Fig.
An increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokine levels exacerbate the degree of dementia in AD
Additionally, high expression of MCP-1 is observed in microglia surrounding senile plaques in the brains of patients with AD
ELISA results revealed a marked increase in TGF-β expression (p < 0.01) (Fig.
Compared to WT mice, APP/PS1 mice exhibited higher levels of Iba1 (p < 0.05), GFAP (p < 0.01), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) (an enzyme that participates in AD-related neuroinflammation by enhancing Iba1 and GFAP
FA treatment markedly decreased the expression levels of these proteins (p < 0.05) (Fig.
Furthermore, FA treatment induced an upregulation of anti-inflammatory factors, including IL-4 (p < 0.01) and IL-10 (p < 0.001) and a concomitant downregulation of proinflammatory factors, including IL-1β (p < 0.01), IL-6 (p < 0.01), IL-18 (p < 0.01), and TNF-α (p < 0.01), as well as p-IκB kinase (IKK) (p < 0.05), p-IκB (p < 0.01), and p-NF-κB (p < 0.01) (Fig.
Collectively, these data suggested that FA treatment suppressed neuroinflammation in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.

FA treatment attenuated ferroptosis and neuroinflammation in erastin-exposed HT22 cells
As a classic ferroptosis inducer, erastin changes the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane by binding voltage-dependent anion channel 2/3 to reduce the rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation, thereby inducing ferroptosis
Further, the inhibition of GPX4 increases lipid ROS production, eventually leading to cell ferroptosis
FA pretreatment significantly improved cell viability in erastin-exposed HT22 cells (p < 0.001) (Fig.
NAD(P)H-GSH-GPX4 signaling is a classic pathway that inhibits ferroptosis.
GSH acts as an electron donor to reduce toxic phospholipid hydroperoxide to non-toxic phospholipid alcohol.
This maintains GPX4 activity and reduces lipid peroxidation which can be broken down into MDA, an end product that is severely toxic to cells
FA treatment significantly suppressed MDA levels (p < 0.001) (Fig.
BODIPY 581/591 C11 staining revealed that FA treatment inhibited erastin-induced lipid ROS production in HT22 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig.
Ferroptosis results in morphological changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure
TEM analysis revealed that mitochondria in erastin-stimulated cells had smaller volume, higher electron density, and disrupted mitochondrial cristae; these pathological alterations in morphology were ameliorated by FA treatment (Fig.
In erastin-exposed HT22 cells, FA treatment significantly attenuated p-Fyn expression (p < 0.05) and upregulated p-PI3K (p < 0.05), p-AKT (p < 0.01), p-GSK-3β (p < 0.05), Nrf2 (p < 0.05), and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) (p < 0.05) expression (Fig.
Similar to the in vivo data, FA treatment upregulated the expression of GPX4 (p < 0.05), cystine/glutamate transporter (xCT) (p < 0.01), FTH (p < 0.05), FTL (p < 0.05), and ferroportin (FPN) (the only known protein in mammals that underscores export of iron
FA treatment suppressed the activation of NF-κB signaling (p < 0.05), which further regulated the expression of ILs (p < 0.05) and TNF-α (p < 0.05) (Fig.
In conjunction with the in vivo results, these findings indicated that FA treatment exerted anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects.

Anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects of FA treatment were mediated by the Nrf2/GPX4 axis
Increased iron levels in the brain induce pro-inflammatory factor production by microglia; conversely, iron accumulation is an established consequence of inflammation
Nevertheless, the specific regulatory processes linking neuroinflammation and ferroptosis have yet to be elucidated.
A recent study reported that targeting the Nrf2/GPX4 axis effectively regulated ferroptosis
GPX4 plays a key role in preventing ferroptosis by reducing phospholipid hydroperoxide, thus inhibiting lipid peroxidation.
Accordingly, GPX4 activation inhibits NF-κB signaling in lipid peroxidation-mediated diseases
The regulatory effects of FA treatment on MDA levels (p < 0.001) (Fig.
Furthermore, the molecular docking results showed that FA possessed an affinity for GPX4 with a binding energy of -6.35 kcal/mol, FA formed hydrogen bonds with GPX4 via GLN-45, CYS-46, GLY-47, LYS-48, ARG-80, and GLN-81.
The interaction between FA and GPX4 formed a binding pocket (Fig.
Nrf2 is a negative regulator of Aβ pathology
The regulatory effects of FA treatment on MDA levels (p < 0.001) (Fig.
These data are consistent with previous observations that Nrf2 regulates ferroptosis and neuroinflammation by influencing GPX4 expression.
Collectively, these data confirmed the involvement of the Nrf2/GPX4 axis in FA-mediated anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammation and provided insight into the crosstalk between ferroptosis and neuroinflammation.

Discussion
In this study, we first expounded the protective properties of FA in AD based on its effects in Aβ-exposed N2a cells, erastin-stimulated HT22 cells, and LPS-stimulated BV2 cells as well as its beneficial effects on memory and cognitive abilities in APP/PS1 mice with AD-like behaviors.
Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis demonstrated that FA treatment modulates the expression of Adcy5 and GNAL, which affect learning by altering cAMP-related dopamine signaling
Furthermore, the Nrf2/GPX4 axis was confirmed to play key roles in FA-mediated anti-neuroinflammation and anti-ferroptosis.
To date, the pathogenesis of AD has not been fully elucidated, and the development of effective treatments has been challenging
Natural products, such as marine-derived oligosaccharides (GV-971), have been identified as potential therapeutic agents
Extracellular senile plaques composed of Aβ peptides have been reported as a key marker of the initiation of the pathogenic cascade of AD
The monoclonal antibody aducanumab targets soluble and insoluble neurotoxic Aβ oligomers and was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of AD in June 2021
Activated microglia associated with Aβ neurotoxicity cause chronic inflammation and aggravate neuronal damage
GV-971 has been reported to inhibit intestinal dysbiosis and regulate the accumulation of phenylalanine/isoleucine and suppress neuroinflammation, thereby improving cognitive impairment, which confirms the key role of neuroinflammation in the pathological process underscoring AD
FA treatment reduced Aβ deposition and exhibited anti-neuroinflammatory effects, as demonstrated by the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokines in several cell lines and APP/PS1 mice.
Significant reductions in DA and DA metabolite levels have been observed in several regions of the post-mortem AD brain
These changes are associated with behavioral symptoms such as apathy and depression and may contribute to cognitive decline
In the Tg2576 mouse model of AD, age-dependent alterations in dopaminergic neuron loss in the ventral tegmental area occur prior to the formation of amyloid plaques, leading to memory deficits
Rotigotine, a DA agonist, has demonstrated beneficial effects on frontal-executive function in a phase 2 trial for AD
The selective DRD1 agonist SKF81297 is thought to be involved in ameliorating hippocampal synaptic damage and improving spatial memory in AD mouse models
DRD1 is the most abundant DA receptor in the central nervous system, and its downstream signaling involves the binding of Gαolf, encoded by the GNAL gene, to guanosine triphosphate.
This results in Adcy5 activation and subsequent cAMP production
Allosteric activation of cAMP promotes cAMPdependent PKA phosphorylation of CREB
Impaired cAMP signaling (including p-CREB) has been observed in the brains of AD patients and relevant mouse models
The enhancement of phosphorylated CREB ameliorates memory impairments in AD mouse models
Moreover, CREB mediates the formation of short-term memories by upregulating BDNF
Accordingly, the combination of BDNF and its endogenous receptor, TrkB, may cause autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of tyrosine residues, which initiates PI3K/AKT activation and promotes neuronal survival
The present data confirm the involvement of dopaminergic signaling in FA-mediated anti-AD effects.
BDNF has been proposed to activate Nrf2 in astrocytes via the truncated TrkB.T1 and p75NTR receptor complex in astrocytes to protect dopaminergic neurons from ferroptosis
The non-oxidized form of DA serves as a strong inhibitor of ferroptosis by inhibiting intracellular iron accumulation and iron-mediated ROS production or by reducing GSH consumption and GPX4 degradation
Intracellular iron is stored in ferritin, which is composed of FTH and FTL, or exported by FPN.
Imbalances in iron input, storage, and output may affect susceptibility to lipid peroxidation
During this process, TFRC and DMT1 regulate the translocation of iron into cells
Due to the enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acid in the brains of AD patients
The formation of lipid peroxides further amplifies ROS signals and decomposes these products to produce the toxic derivative, MDA.
MDA reacts with DNA bases or proteins, causing severe cytotoxicity.
GPX4 inhibits lipoxygenase-mediated lipid peroxidation by reducing phospholipid hydrogen peroxide and plays a key role in preventing ferroptosis
In this study, FA treatment significantly reduced intracellular iron content by partially reducing iron entry and promoting iron output.
These effects were associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation in cell lines and APP/PS1 mice.
In pathological conditions of neurodegenerative diseases, iron overload triggers microglial polarization to the pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype via ROS, which increases the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β and promotes neuroinflammation
IL-1β and TNF-α upregulate TFRC and DMT1 and downregulate FPN, resulting in increased ferrous iron influx and reduced iron efflux in cells
Consequently, neuroinflammation and iron interact to form an amplified ROS production circuit, leading to neuronal ferroptosis
Metabolic dysfunction of microglia and astrocytes leads to Aβ accumulation, which in turn activates microglia and astrocytes, and activated glial cells release neuroinflammatory mediators, including IL-1β and IL-6 via Toll-like receptors and NF-κB signaling pathways
IL-1β induces IL-6 production by astrocytes and neurons, which in turn modulates behavior and cognitive function in rats administered with IL-6 into the bilateral hippocampus and in IL-6 knockout mice
Our results demonstrated that FA treatment exerted anti-neuroinflammatory properties by targeting microglia and astrocytes via IKK/IκB/ NF-κB signaling.
Based on previous research demonstrating the involvement of anti-ferroptosis and anti-neuroinflammation in AD treatment, we investigated FA-mediated anti-AD effects.
GPX4 stimulates the release of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators in the inflammation-related arachidonic acid metabolic network and inhibits the NF-κB pathway activated by TNF or IL-1
An increase in GFAP expression levels was observed in adult mice that were deficient in GPX4
Nrf2 has been reported to regulate neuroinflammation and ferroptosis and influence GPX4 expression
siRNA-induced silencing of Nrf2 expression blocked melatonin-induced upregulation of GPX4 and xCT expression in MC3T3 cells
Moreover, the concentration of supernatant TNF-α was increased and that of supernatant IL-4 and IL-10 was decreased in Nrf2-silenced BV2 cells
These findings are consistent with the observation that Nrf2 siRNA abrogated FA-mediated upregulation of GPX4, xCT, and FPN and NF-κB pathway inactivation.
Collectively, these results indicate that FA treatment protects against erastin-induced ferroptosis by activating the Nrf2/GPX4 axis, and its suppression of ferroptosis exerts positive regulatory effects on neuroinflammation.
This study has several limitations.
We only measured ferroptosis and neuroinflammation-related proteins and factors in the brains of APP/PS1 mice at a single time point rather than at different time stages.
As such, we did not assess whether ferroptosis occurs prior to or concurrently with neuroinflammation, and it remains unclear whether a feedback loop between these processes exists.
Additionally, the relationship between Nrf2/GPX4 and dopaminergic terminal signaling pathways, as well as IKK/IκB/NF-κB signaling, remains to be explored.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated that FA treatment exerted anti-AD properties via modulation of ferroptosis-mediated neuroinflammation by targeting the activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 axis.
Our data suggest that inactivation of the Nrf2/GPX4 axis activates NF-κB signaling, which further aggravates neuroinflammation (Fig.
Our study systematically demonstrates the multitarget protective effects of FA and highlights its therapeutic potential as a promising drug component for the treatment of AD. glial fibrillary acidic protein; H&E: hematoylin and eosin; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1; IκB: inhibitor of NF-κB; IKK: IκB kinase; Iba1: ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; IL: interleukin; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MWM: Morris water maze; MMP: mitochondrial membrane potential; MDA: malondialdehyde; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; NO: nitric oxide; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; Nrf2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; NQO1: NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1; PBS: phosphate buffer solution; PKA: protein kinase A; GSK-3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3β; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3kinase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; RNAi: RNA interference; RIPA: radio immunoprecipitation assay; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TEM: transmission electron microscopy; TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β; TFRC: transferrin receptor; TrkB: tyrosine kinase receptor B; xCT: cystine/glutamate transporter.
