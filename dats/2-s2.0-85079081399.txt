Exposure of CuO Nanoparticles Contributes to Cellular Apoptosis, Redox Stress, and Alzheimer’s Aβ Amyloidosis
Fe 2 O 3 , CuO and ZnO nanoparticles (NP) have found various industrial and biomedical applications.
However, there are growing concerns among the general public and regulators about their potential environmental and health impacts as their physio-chemical interaction with biological systems and toxic responses of the latter are complex and not well understood.
Herein we first reported that human SH-SY5Y and H4 cells and rat PC12 cell lines displayed concentration-dependent neurotoxic responses to insults of CuO nanoparticles (CuONP), but not to Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (Fe 2 O 3 NP) or ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONP).
This study provides evidence that CuONP induces neuronal cell apoptosis, discerns a likely p53-dependent apoptosis pathway and builds out the relationship between nanoparticles and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased Aβ levels in SH-SY5Y and H4 cells.
Our results implicate that exposure to CuONP may be an environmental risk factor for AD.
For public health concerns, regulation for environmental or occupational exposure of CuONP are thus warranted given AD has already become a pandemic.

Introduction
Nanotechnology is a rapidly developing field which involves the creation and/or manipulation of materials at the nanometer (nm) scale and is arising as a consequence of the novel properties these materials have to offer.
According to the ASTM (formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials) standard definition, nanoparticles (NP) are particles with lengths that range from 1 to 100 nanometers in two or three dimensions
Newly developed nanoparticle-based products have been introduced or are being currently developed in a number of diverse areas, including electronics, food, clothing, medicines, cosmetics and sporting equipment
In medical fields, the applications include drug-delivery platforms
Some of the more common engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) used are comprised of metals and metal oxides of Al, Fe, Au, Si, Pd, Ce, Cu, Zn and Ti.
Metal oxides, such as CuO, ZnO and Fe 2 O 3 play a very important role in many areas of chemistry, physics, materials science and even biomedical fields.
Because of the wide application of nanoparticles and their highly publicized advantages in industrial and medical applications, human exposure to engineered nanoparticles, via inhalation, oral, dermal and injection routes, has increased.
Inhalation of nanoparticles may occur as a consequence of their release into the environment, either during their manufacture or utilization.
There is also an opportunity for their inhalation by workers during their manufacture
Inhaled nanoparticles have the capacity to transit to the brain, routing along the olfactory nerve
Although the properties of metal oxide nanoparticles may be impressive from a material science perspective, they may have overlooked toxic effects.
Several studies have compared the toxicity of nanoparticles, some with a focus on metals or metal oxides
Copper oxides in particular, from which cellular copper ions Cu 2+ can be derived, are notable for their role in oxidation reactions, where they are reduced to Cu 1+
CuONP cytotoxicity has been proven in many experiments on a cellular level
They have been shown to be genotoxic, inducing DNA fragmentation and chromosomal damage on neuronal cell populations
ZnONP toxicity has also been studied in cells and bacteria
Published studies showed that ZnONPs were toxic to T-cells above 5 mM concentration
Thus, it appears that toxicity to the neuro cells were greater than toward bacteria, which have a threshold of 5 mM
A study by
Clearly the type of cell in question is important when considering the human cell toxicity of ZnONP
Fe 2 O 3 /Fe 3 O 4 NP are used in medicine as both MRI contrast agents and anticancer agents
However, some studies indicate they contribute to neurodegenerative processes, such as oxidative stress and apoptosis, following prolonged exposure
Metal nanoparticles have also been found to be associated with the accumulation of Aβ and promoting the formation of amyloid plaques
Nanoparticles of metal oxides produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative stress and ultimately leading to toxicological injury.
Once inside the cell, nanomaterials may induce intracellular oxidative stress by disturbing the balance between oxidant and antioxidant processes.
The oxidative stress induced by exposure to nanomaterials may stimulate an increase of the cytosolic calcium concentration
It has been reported that TiO 2 NP can decrease the level of glutathione, an antioxidant, in rat alveolar macrophages
The ultrafine particles may exert mediated proinflammatory effects and induce the cell's apoptosis through an ROS-mediated mechanism
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects one in 10 persons over the age of 65 and 32% of people over the age of 85
It is associated with extracellular deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the form of amyloid senile plaques, intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and progressive neuronal loss
Many of the neurons that undergo apoptosis in AD exhibit high levels of activated apoptotic proteins such as caspase 3 and Bax, and they exhibit neurofibrillary tangle pathology
In addition, DNA damage and upregulation of the proapoptotic proteins p53 and Bax occur in vulnerable neuronal populations at a relatively early stage in the disease process
Apoptosis may be responsible for cell disappearance and may play a key role at the root of the AD process
Besides the pathological hallmarks of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, AD brains exhibit evidence of ROS-mediated injury
ROS, also called free radicals, are formed under normal conditions.
An imbalance between the generation of free radicals and antioxidants may be involved in the pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases
There is a great deal of research tying nanoparticles specifically to neurotoxic effects, especially with regard to CuONP.
CuONP have been found to trigger significant cell-death events in human neuroglioma cells at concentrations of over 100 µm
Studies indicate that CuONP exert a similar dose-dependent toxicity on H4 cells
As of now, the cause of AD is not very clear.
A host of different genetic and environmental factors appear to play into AD development.
Some toxic nanoparticles that induce ROS generation, and lead to neuro-cell apoptosis, may be one of the risk factors for AD.
In this study, we seek to assess the cytotoxicity of CuONP, ZnONP and Fe 2 O 3 NP, and determine whether CuONPs can induce brain-cell death via an apoptosis pathway and/or if they increase Aβ and/or ROS.
In this study, we made use of the H4 human neuroglioma cell line, which is known to be impacted by CuONP
We also utilized rat pheochromocytoma-12 cells (PC12), another popular neuron-like cell line
Herein, we demonstrated cellular exposure of CuONP may be implicated in AD amyloid pathology via neuronal apoptosis, ROS generation and increases in Aβ levels.

Materials and Methods

Cells Lines and Treatment
The human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (CRL-2266), human neuroglioma H4 (HTB-148) and rat PC12 (CRL-1721) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
They were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 • C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide.
The cells were routinely passaged every 5 to 7 days.
Nanoparticles were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and all were kept as a stock solution in 0.9% saline.

Cell Cytotoxicity Assay
Cytotoxicity tests were performed using the Promega CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation (MTS) assay to determine the number of viable cells in culture (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Monolayers of 5000 cells were plated into 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) in medium containing 10% FBS.
Plating 24 h later, when the cells had attached and reached above 50% confluency, the medium was placed in a solution containing different nanoparticles at varying concentrations.
All experiments were performed for 48 h and in triplicate.
Controls included 0.1% saline.
Nanoparticles were used at concentrations ranging from 0.01-100 µM.
Each experiment was reproduced and confirmed in at least three independent experiments.
After treatment, one solution reagent 20 µL/well was added directly to culture wells.
After 3 h incubation, the plate was read by Benchmark Plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
The absorbance of the formazan product was at 490 nm.
The data was plotted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA).

Trypan Blue Staining
H4 cells 1.5 × 10 5 , SH-SY5Y 2.5 × 10 5 were plated into a 48-well plate.
After treatment by different nanoparticles of different concentrations and at different times, cells were harvested with 10% medium and 1:2 dilution with 0.4% Trypan Blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Dead cells were stained blue, and the total living cells were counted on a hemocytometer under a microscope.
Cells were adjusted in 200-500/squares with different dilutions.
Then living cells were compared with cells without treatment.

TUNEL Staining
The TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay (TMR-RED in situ cell death detection kit) (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) was carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions.
H4 cells: 2.0 × 10 4 , SH-SY5Y cells: 4.0 × 10 4 and PC12 cells 4.0 × 10 4 were plated into an 8-well glass chamber slide System (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) and grown for 24 h.
Then cells were treated with CuONP 100 µM or medium (CTL).
All experiments were performed for 24 h.
After treatment, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 1 h, then incubated with permeabilization solution for 5 min on ice; cells were incubated with enzyme mixture for one hour in the humidified atmosphere for 60 min at 37 • C in the dark.
Then Hoechst (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to stain total nuclear.
The optical sections were taken with a fluorescent microscope and the number of TUNEL-positive cells were counted.

Western Blots
SH-SY5Y cells 1.0 × 10 6 , H4 cells 8 × 10 5 were plated and grown on 60 mm culture plate dishes for 24 h.
When the cells had attached and reached above 60%-80% confluency, cells were treated with 100 µM CuONP at different times (SH-SY5Y 16 h and H4 6 h).
After washing with cold PBS, cells were subjected to lysis in a RIPA buffer 0.1 mL (Boston BioProducts, Ashland, MA, USA) and SH-SY5Y 0.2 mL was applied to H4 cells.
Each amount of protein lysate was loaded onto 4%-12% Tris-Bis gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then electro-transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with 1:200 different primary antibodies (p53, 1:1000) overnight at 4 • C.
After washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies 1:5000 for 2 h at room temperature and developed a film by detection kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).
Each experiment was repeated independently.
Primary antibodies for p53, procaspase 3 and procaspase 9 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA).
Then the membranes were stripped with stripping buffer and re-incubated with the primary antibody for actin as a protein loading control.
The final films were scanned, and densities were analyzed by NIH ImageJ software.

Caspase 3 Activity Assay
After treatment with CuONP (100 µM), 2.0 × 10 6 cells (SH-SY5Y, PC12 and H4) were used to measure caspase 3 activity.
After washing with ice PBS, cells were lysed by Assay Buffer (AB) 100 µL containing 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDT, 0.1% CHAPS, 1% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, and put on ice for 1 min, and then centrifuged at the highest speed for 1 min at room temperature.
The supernatants were saved in -20 • C. Caspase 3 activity was determined using a caspase 3 activity detection kit (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA).
The caspase 3 fluorometric substrate (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC) was prepared as a stock solution of 7.2 mM in DMSO, stored in -20 • C, and used at a final concentration of 192 µM after dilution in AB.
At the start of the proteolytic assay, cell lysate 50 µL and AB-diluted substrate 50 µL were added to a 96-well plate (Nunc), and fluorescence of the cleavage product was repeatedly measured over time at room temperature for 1 h and 30 min in a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), with the excitation wavelength at 350 nm and the detection wavelength at 460 nm.
Maximal enzyme activity (V max ) was calculated and expressed as relative fluorescence units/second.
Data was plotted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA).

Cellular Thiol Level Assay
The Fluorescent Thiol detection assay was performed as per manufacturer's instructions.
After treatment with CuONP (0.1-100 µM) and L-Buthionine-sulfoximine (L-BSO) (0.001-1 µM), 4.0 × 10 5 cells (SH-SY5Y) and 4.0 × 10 5 (PC12 and H4) were used to measure caspase 3 activity.
Cells were washed by 2 mL PBS twice.
Cellular thiol level was measured using the Fluorescent Thiol Detection Kit (Cell Technology Inc, Fremont, CA, USA).
Cell lysis buffer 200 µL was added, and cell lysates were centrifuged at the highest speed for 5 min.
The supernatants 50 µL and the reaction cocktail 50 µL (1 mL cell lysis buffer and 20 µL of the reconstituted dye) were added together into a 96-well black plate.
The plate was read immediately with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 538 nm.
The percentage of fluorescence unit change is calculated by each value divided by the control level.
Data was plotted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA).

Three cell lines, 1.0 × 10 6 cells (SH-SY5Y) and 4.0 × 10 5 (PC12 and H4), were plated on the Capture Antibody Coated Plate, and media 1.5 mL was added into the cells after plating 24 h.
H4 and PC12 cells were treated for 6 h and SH-SY5Y cells were treated for 16 h.
Media were taken out and saved in -80 • C. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured by Beta Amyloid x-40 and x-42 ELISA kit (Covance Research Products Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA).
Samples were diluted 1 time and with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection antibody: x-40, 1:1000; x-42, 1:250, overnight.
After washing 5 times, mix chemiluminescent substrates 100 µL were added.

CuONP Increased Caspase 3 Activity
To investigate the pathway of cell apoptosis by CuONP, we measured caspase 3 activity as an indicator of apoptosis induction since different upstream pathways leading to apoptosis depend on caspase 3 induction for final apoptotic execution.

If cells were pretreated with NAC, the Aβ could not be detected.
Figure
CuONP increased Aβ40 and Aβ42, and L-BSO only increased Aβ42 in SH-SY5Y cells.
CuONP and L-BSO can increase Aβ40, but not Aβ42 in H4 cells.
When pretreated with NAC followed by the administration of the CuONP or L-BSO, there was no detectable increase in both SH-SY5Y and H4 cells.

To find out the potential relationship between CuONP and AD pathology, we performed amyloid β-protein (Aβ) ELISA assay on SH-SY5Y and H4 cells.
If cells were pretreated with NAC, the Aβ could not be detected.

CuONP increased Aβ40 and Aβ42, and L-BSO only increased Aβ42 in SH-SY5Y cells.
CuONP and L-BSO can increase Aβ40, but not Aβ42 in H4 cells.
When pretreated with NAC followed by the administration of the CuONP or L-BSO, there was no detectable increase in both SH-SY5Y and H4 cells.
We measured Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in cell media after treatment with CuONP at 100 μM and L-BSO at 1 μM, and they were also measured when cells were pretreated with NAC for 1 h, followed by treatment of CuONP and L-BSO, respectively.
Measurements were taken of SY5Y(A) levels for Aβ40 (A.1) and Aβ42 (A.2) and of H4 levels for Aβ40 (B.1) and Aβ42 (B.2).
Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were increased by treatment with CuONP, and only Aβ42 was increased by treatment with L-BSO on SH-SY5Y cells; Aβ40 level was increased by treatment with CuONP and L-BSO, but not Aβ42.
Cells were plated into 6-well plate and treated with CuONP or L-BSO in 1.5 mL media: 6 h on H4 cells, and 16 h on SH-SY5Y cells.

Differences between Cell Lines
Throughout the set of experiments performed in this study, there were notable differences between cell lines in terms of their responses to the various nanoparticles and other agents.
Though this study did not examine the mechanistic differences between the different cell lines in terms of the observed responses, these differences are likely attributable to their different origins.
PC12 is derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma that are notably nerve growth factor (NGF) receptive
SH-SY5Y, originally called SK-N-SH, was derived from metastatic neuroblastoma tissue
H4 cells were derived from human neuroglioma cells.
Though the different cell lines are frequently used in neural studies, they are not identical, and some differences in results are to be expected.

Discussion
The defining characteristics of nanoparticles, their small size and large surface area to volume ratios, render nanoparticles more biologically active than larger materials.
Due to their size, nanoparticles have a higher probability of reaching deep into the lungs, and once deposited, they seem to be able to translocate to other organs
As the use of nanoparticles increases, it becomes more and more important to investigate their possible adverse effects to human health and the environment
Metal oxide nanoparticles are one of the most important categories of nanoparticles.
Some in vitro studies on the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles have been reported
We compared three metal oxide nanoparticles: CuONP, ZnONP and Fe2O3NP cell cytotoxicity on three neuronal cell lines: SH-SY5Y, H4 and PC12.
The MTS assay and Trypan Blue staining were used to measure cell cytotoxicity.
We found that CuONP is highly cytotoxic to H4 and PC12 cells and moderately We measured Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in cell media after treatment with CuONP at 100 µM and L-BSO at 1 µM, and they were also measured when cells were pretreated with NAC for 1 h, followed by treatment of CuONP and L-BSO, respectively.

As the use of nanoparticles increases, it becomes more and more important to investigate their possible adverse effects to human health and the environment
Metal oxide nanoparticles are one of the most important categories of nanoparticles.
Some in vitro studies on the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles have been reported
We compared three metal oxide nanoparticles: CuONP, ZnONP and Fe 2 O 3 NP cell cytotoxicity on three neuronal cell lines: SH-SY5Y, H4 and PC12.
The MTS assay and Trypan Blue staining were used to measure cell cytotoxicity.
We found that CuONP is highly cytotoxic to H4 and PC12 cells and moderately cytotoxic to Sy5y cells, while ZnONP and Fe 2 O 3 NP were not found to be cytotoxic to any of the three cell lines at the tested concentrations.
Hanna et al. reported that CuONPs are highly toxic
Other research has been performed on the toxicity of ZnONP, CuONP and TiO 2 NP on the bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the crustaceans Daphnia magna and Thamnocephalus platyurus.
It was observed that the toxicity of TiO 2 NP is greatest, followed by CuONP and ZnONP
Based on current research, it seems there is a high degree of variability in the response different cell types have to the toxic effects of nanoparticles
Further, we consider the cytotoxicity of CuONP on the three cell lines.
Apoptosis and necrosis are presently recognized as the two major types of physiologic or pathologic cell death.
A prominent molecular hallmark of apoptosis is a specific pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA.
Using a fluorescent marker, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the repetitive addition of dNTPs to the 3´-OH end of a DNA fragment, one can detect cells with apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
We detected that only at the highest dose (100 µM), CuONP induced apoptosis in the three neuron cell lines, but not at lower doses (data not shown at lower doses).
We used a TdT kit to stain SY5Y, H4 and PC12 cells after treatment with CuONP at 100µM and observed an increase in the number of apoptotic cells.
Caspase activation is a central feature of apoptosis.
In general, caspase 8 and 9 appear to be "initiator" caspases, while caspase 3, 6 and 7 are secondarily activated and are termed "effector" caspases because they act on a variety of cell proteins.
Procaspases are activated caspases through a process of self-cleavage.
In this study it was found that procaspase 9 decreased after treatment of high dose CuONP, along with a corresponding reduction in procaspase 3. Further, we observed that levels of activated caspase 3 in cells increased dramatically.
These results show that treatment with CuONP at 100 µM promotes apoptosis in cells.
The decrease observed in SH-SY5Y cells is the smallest between the three cell lines, a result that is consistent with the cytotoxicity test results.
There are two general pathways for activation of apoptosis: the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
The first is derived from extracellular signals and results in subplasmalemmal aggregation of caspases through an association of cytoplasmic domains of ligand receptors.
The second is mediated by intracellular factors and involves changes in mitochondrial permeability, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, association of protein with an apoptosis-aggregating factor and activation of caspase 9
We also checked the expression of p53, as p53 triggers an extensive network of signaling pathways, to ensure that cells have an appropriate response to a given stress; basal levels of p53 are generally low in unstressed cells
Intriguingly, p53 can intervene at every major step in apoptotic pathways: from extrinsic death receptor signaling, through the convergent pathway component Bid, to the intrinsic mitochondrial pathways involving apoptosome formation, and culminating in direct caspase activation
Here, p53 expression increased after treatment of high dose of CuONP, indicating that p53 is involved in the apoptosis process induced by CuONP.
During the normal course of metabolism, oxygen is partially reduced as electrons leak out of the electron transport chain during respiration
These partially reduced oxygen species can react with organic substances through non-catalytic means.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important cellular regulators but are also sources of considerable damage.
Elevation of ROS beyond the buffering capacity of the cell can lead to oxidative stress.
Elevated ROS levels can cause damage to DNA/RNA, proteins and lipids which may ultimately lead to apoptosis.
Cells have developed several mechanisms to counteract elevated ROS levels such as a thiol reducing buffer, composed of components such as glutathione and thioredoxin, for the maintenance of the reduction-oxidation (redox) state of the cell, and enzymes to remove ROS (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase)
Excess ROS production is also a notable component of some apoptosis pathways, with antioxidants exerting an inhibitory effect on the induction of cell death
However, Previous research has shown that nanoparticles induce oxidative stress, which leads to inflammation
In two studies about nanoparticles inducing cell apoptosis, it was found that TiO 2 nanoparticles could not only photocatalyze DNA oxidative damage, but also induce cell apoptosis both in vitro and in human cells
In Long et al., it was reported that nanoscale TiO 2 NP not only stimulated brain microglia to produce ROS through an oxidative burst, but the particles also interfered with mitochondrial energy production in vitro
Based on the results of this study, it appears that CuONP has an effect of cell apoptosis on neuronal cells via ROS.
L-BSO, which is a strong oxidant, had a similar effect on the cells to CuONP.
Furthermore NAC, an antioxidant, appears to mitigate the damage from both L-BSO and CuONP.
The etiology and type of neuronal death in most neurodegenerative diseases remains controversial.
However, research suggests that in neurodegenerative disorders such as AD, specific neuronal groups die by apoptosis
As of now, it is clear that the AD etiology is related to numerous different factors.
These include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and other environmental factors.
Based on prior research, nanoparticles have been found to induce brain inflammation
This study has shown that CuONP induced apoptosis in three types of brain cells (SH-SY5Y, H4 and PC12), and CuONP neurotoxicity also involves ROS formation.
These findings lend credence to the idea that CuONP exposure may be an environmental risk factor for AD.
AD is associated with extracellular deposition of amyloid Aβ in the form of senile plaques, intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, and progressive neuronal loss
Aβ40 and Aβ42, the latter of which is the most closely related to AD pathology, are produced from the cleavage of amyloid protein precursor (APP) by β and γ secretases.
AD and the production of Aβ was linked by Anne Eckert to mitochondrial dysfunction, the caspase-apoptosis pathway and neuronal loss
In this study, we observed increased Aβ production in neural cells undergoing apoptosis, which is consistent with the hypothesis.
Neural cells exposed to CuONP experienced neurotoxicity and increased cell apoptosis, involving ROS and p53, and increased Aβ production.
These results seem to suggest that exposure to CuONP may be an environmental factor involved in AD pathogenesis, and antioxidants such as NAC may mitigate its neurotoxic effect.

Conclusions
The experiments performed in this study affirm that CuONP exposure exerts neurotoxic effects on neuronal cells, while ZnONP and Fe 2 O 3 NP exhibited only limited toxic effects.
SH-SY5Y, H4 and PC12 cells exposed to CuONP experienced significant increases in apoptotic events and significant decreases in cell proliferation, with H4 and PC12 experiencing the most profound effects.
This is corroborated by corresponding increases in caspase 3 activity in all three cell lines, with H4 and PC12 cells again experiencing the most dramatic changes.
Cells undergoing apoptosis experience a decrease in the activity of procaspases, as these procaspases are activated in apoptotic pathways; in all three cell lines, levels of procaspases 3 and 9 were found to be lower when exposed to CuONP.
A final indicator of apoptosis, p53 expression, was also found to increase following CuONP treatments; this also shows that the apoptosis-pathway promoted by CuONP toxicity is likely p53-dependent.
All of these results confirm that CuONP has the capacity to trigger apoptotic events in brain cells, though the magnitude of the response appears to be dependent on cell type.
Additionally, exposure to CuONP decreased thiol levels in cells, an effect which was countered by pretreatment with the antioxidant NAC.
This indicates CuONP toxicity induces ROS formation, but this effect was also highly dependent on cell type.
Finally, Aβ40 and 42, The primary components of Aβ amyloid plaques that are pathological features of AD, were found to increase in SH-SY5Y cells when exposed to CuONP.
This effect was also dampened with NAC pretreatment, indicating the Aβ increase may be due to oxidative stress.
Notably, Aβ40 did not change in SH-SY5Y or H4 cells, and Aβ42 levels were mostly unchanged in H4 cells regardless of CuONP exposure or NAC pretreatment.
Overall, these results support the idea that, via neuronal apoptosis, ROS generation and increases in Aβ levels, exposure to CuONP may be an environmental risk factor that contributes to AD etiopathology.
Future in vivo study is necessary to confirm the potential link between CuONP exposure and AD.
For public health concerns, regulation for environmental or occupational exposure of CuONP are thus warranted given AD has already become a pandemic.

The supernatants were saved for ELISA assay.
For assay, samples were mixed with antibody according to the protocol and incubated overnight.
Substrates were added into the plate and read with luminescent reader.
The percentage of fluorescent changes were calculated.
* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01.
