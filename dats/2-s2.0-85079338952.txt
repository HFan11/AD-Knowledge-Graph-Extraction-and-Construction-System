Caspase-6 Knockout in the 5xFAD Model of Alzheimer’s Disease Reveals Favorable Outcome on Memory and Neurological Hallmarks
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common form of dementia in the elderly.
Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are major mediators of apoptosis and inflammation.
Caspase-6 is considered to be an up-stream modulator of AD pathogenesis as active caspase-6 is abundant in neuropil threads, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles of AD brains.
In order to further elucidate the role of caspase-6 activity in the pathogenesis of AD, we produced a double transgenic mouse model, combining the 5xFAD mouse model of AD with caspase-6 knock out (C6-KO) mice.
Behavioral examinations of 5xFAD/C6-KO double transgenic mice showed improved performance in spatial learning, memory, and anxiety/risk assessment behavior, as compared to 5xFAD mice.
Hippocampal mRNA expression analyses showed significantly reduced levels of inflammatory mediator TNF-α, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice.
A significant reduction in amyloid-β plaques could be observed and immunohistochemistry analyses showed reduced levels of activated microglia and astrocytes in 5xFAD/C6-KO, compared to 5xFAD mice.
Together, these results indicate a substantial role for caspase-6 in the pathology of the 5xFAD model of AD and suggest further validation of caspase-6 as a potential therapeutic target for AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an ever-growing neurological disorder, with numbers projected to attain 14 million by 2050
It is considered one of the leading causes of death in America, and tremendous amounts of money have been spent to combat the disorder to no avail.
Progression of the disease is affected by various factors, some of which are well-established and characterized.
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an internal membrane protein that can be cleaved by several enzymes.
The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of APP by βand γ-secretases
The β-cleaved peptide can then be aberrantly folded and conform into amyloid oligomers and plaques, which are thought to be an early event in the progression of AD
The APP can also be cleaved at APP/C99 by caspases which, in turn, produces a neurotoxic peptide (C31)
Caspases are a family of proteases that cleave specific target proteins and have a variety of roles in cellular processes.
They are divided into two general categories: initiators or executioners.
Each caspase can affect inflammation, apoptosis, or both, and they are highly conserved throughout species
Executioner caspases are activated through cleavage of the prodomain, followed by cleavage into smaller subunits that form the active caspase heterodimer
Caspases have been implicated in numerous diseases as their function leads to apoptosis and cell death
Elucidating their roles in those diseases has been the subject of many years of research around the world.
Caspase-6 belongs to the pro-apoptotic executioner caspase group and is activated by a series of upstream activators, amongst which are caspase-3 and caspase-1
Caspase-6 was shown to mediate several non-apoptotic processes, such as facilitating axonal pruning during development
Cleavage by caspase-6 of the mutant huntingtin gene was shown to be a prerequisite for neuronal dysfunction and degeneration, and therefore, exacerbates neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease
Caspase-6 activity is associated with AD pathological lesions and is present at the early stages of tangle formation
The pro-apoptotic protein p53 is increased in AD brains and p53 directly up-regulates the transcription of caspase-6
Caspase-6 cleaves the APP at a specific site, creating the toxic small peptide C31, a potent inducer of apoptosis in cultured neuroblastoma cells
Thus, caspase-6 is considered to be an up-stream modulator of AD pathogenesis, and as a result, a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD
Caspase-6 knock-out (KO) neurons are protected against excitotoxicity, trophic factor deprivation, and myelin induced axonal degeneration
Caspase-6 KO mice were first described by Uribe et al.
Research using these mice showed a reduction in the inflammatory response and behavioral changes following peripheral pro-inflammatory stimuli by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
Knock-out mice are often used in scientific environments in order to elucidate mechanisms of the targeted proteins.
In the present study, we aimed to use the caspase-6 KO mice to better understand its role in AD.
The 5-gene familial AD (5xFAD) mice have five distinct human mutations either in the APP or Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) genes
These mice have been used extensively to study AD progression, as well as potential treatments for the diseases, due to their similarity to human AD pathologies.
To this end, we have generated a novel double-KO strain harboring both caspase-6 KO, together with the 5xFAD model.
Through behavior tests, protein, and mRNA analysis, we have shown a beneficial effect of caspase-6 KO on memory and inflammatory markers in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice.
By evaluating neurological hallmarks, we have shown a reduction in reactive astrocytes and microglia in mice hippocampi, as well as alleviation of plaque burden in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice.
This has served us to better evaluate the impact of caspase-6 activity on AD progression and its distinct pathologies.

Results

Generation of Double Transgenic Mice
In order to evaluate the effects of caspase-6 knock out (KO) in AD, we crossbred 5xFAD
We used double transgenic [5xFAD (+/-) x Caspase-6 (-/-)] 5xFAD/C6-KO mice and compared them to 5xFAD/C6-Het mice [5xFAD (+/-) x Caspase-6 (+/-)], together with their wild type (WT) and KO littermates (Designated WT/C6-Het and WT/C6-KO).
Behavior tests started when mice were six and a half months of age.

Caspase-6-KO in 5xFAD Female Mice Improves Behavioral Deficits
Initially, we examined risk/anxiety-related assessments in the elevated plus maze, where WT mice generally spent more time in the closed arms of the maze, while 5xFAD mice showed tendency toward the open, exposed arms
In our experiment, 5xFAD/C6-Het female mice spent significantly more time in the open arms, reflecting perturbed risk assessment behavior, compared to WT mice.
In the female group, 5xFAD/C6-KO mice spent significantly less time in the open arms of the maze compared to 5xFAD/C6-Het mice (Figure
However, male transgenic mice did not appear to follow the expected model (Figure

In the female group, 5xFAD/C6-KO mice spent significantly less time in the open arms of the maze compared to 5xFAD/C6-Het mice (Figure
However, male transgenic mice did not appear to follow the expected model (Figure
Next, we tested whether caspase-6 KO would inhibit the cognitive decline seen in 5xFAD mice.
The Y-maze test can be configured to evaluate spatial working memory, which is showed to be impaired at an onset of four to five months of age in 5xFAD mice
Here, 5xFAD/C6-Het female mice showed reduced exploration time in the novel arms as compared to WT mice.
Conversely, 5xFAD/C6-KO female mice demonstrated a 30% increase in time spent in the novel arms of the maze as compared to 5xFAD/C6-Het mice (Figure
No significant difference in exploration time was measured between 5xFAD/C6-Het and 5xFAD/C6-KO male mice (Figure
Together, these results indicate that Caspase-6 KO reduces risk assessment, and anxiety and memory-related behavior in female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice.
Marked improvement is observed in female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice compared to their transgenic counterpart, both in forced alternation Y-maze and Elevated plus maze (Figure
Male mice did not show an improvement in the Y-maze (Figure

Caspase-6 KO in 5xFAD Mice Ameliorates Spatial Memory and Learning Time in the Morris Water Maze Test
We then examined spatial learning capacity in these mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) test at seven months of age.
During the four days of the trial, both female and male 5xFAD/C6-Het mice showed significantly longer latency to find the platform, reflecting impaired spatial learning (Figure
However, both female and male 5xFAD/C6-KO mice showed improved learning ability, demonstrated by a significantly shorter time to find the platform on day two for female mice, and day two and day four in male mice, as compared to 5xFAD/C6-Het mice (Figure
at seven months of age.

Mice were tested for platform position learning at seven months of age in the MWM test.
Mice were trained to find the hidden platform four times a day, for four days.

The learning improvement in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice could also be reflected in the probe test on day five.
While 5xFAD/C6-Het mice exhibited relatively less time in the platform quadrant, 5xFAD/C6-KO male mice showed greater preference and searching behavior around the platform position (Figure

On the fifth day of the MWM test, the platform was removed, and mice were released from the furthest position to quadrant #1 (Q1).

Synaptophysin, a Pre-Synaptic Marker, is Up-Regulated in 5xFAD/C6-KO Double Transgenic Mice
During the progression of AD, Aβ causes loss of dendritic spines which subsequently give rise to cognitive dysfunctions
This leads to reduction in potential healthy synapses and strength of connections among neurons.
It was also shown that caspase-6 could mediate synapse dysfunction and loss before the occurrence of neurodegeneration and cell death
Synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic marker, is increased dramatically in both male and female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice, suggesting that higher neuronal interaction may occur when caspase-6 is reduced in transgenic mice (Figure
This increase in synaptophysin may suggest an improved synaptic density in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice.

Gene Expressions are Altered in 5xFAD/C6-KO Double Transgenic Mice
Caspase-6 is known to affect inflammation and can be activated by the neuronal Nod-like receptor protein 1 (NRLP1) inflammasome through a caspase-1-dependent pathway, which releases interleukin1-β (IL-1β) and causes caspase-6 mediated axonal degeneration
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), are known to be up-regulated in 5xFAD transgenic mice
In the 5xFAD/C6-KO group, TNF-α levels were significantly reduced in male mice compared to their transgenic counterpart (Figure
Female mice did not display a clear distinction between the two transgenic strains (Figure

Amyloid-β Aggregates in the Hippocampus are Reduced in Caspase-6 KO Double Transgenic Mice
Aβ aggregation is one of the main pathologies of AD, and in the 5xFAD mouse model, extracellular amyloid deposition begins at two months of age
Thioflavin S (ThioS) staining is often used as a marker of fibrillar material with a β-pleated sheet conformation
This staining method can quite reliably detect intraneuronal Aβ42 in its aggregated stage in this AD model.
5xFAD/C6-Het mice show extensive depositions and aggregates of plaques in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus.
When comparing the two transgenic groups, a significant reduction in plaque depositions is detected in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice (Figure
This finding can support the positive effect in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice on memory task performance as plaque burden is associated with hippocampal memory
IL-10 is an important negative immune regulator that can prevent damage caused by pro-inflammatory processes, and it was found to be in close relationship with caspase-6
In both caspase-6 KO groups, IL-10 gene expression was elevated compared to Het groups (Figure
This might suggest an up-regulated anti-inflammatory process, which may lead to reduced inflammation in the double transgenic model.
Another gene closely related to caspase-6 is caspase-3, as it was shown that caspase-6 can act as an initiator in the activation of caspase-3
Here, we show that caspase-3 is reduced in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice compared to 5xFAD/C6-Het male mice (Figure
A reduction in caspase-3 activity can be directly linked to a reduction in neuronal cell death, as well as plaque formation
Additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-1β, are known to increase in AD and play a fundamental role in the progression of the disease
Gene expression of both these genes in male and female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice were not altered, compared to their 5xFAD/C6-Het counterpart [Supplementary Figure
Although caspase-6 plays a role in the increase of these cytokines

Activated Astrocyte and Microglia are Reduced in 5xFAD/C6-KO Mice
To further investigate the neurological impact of caspase-6 KO mice, markers of astrocytes and microglia were analyzed.
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is involved in controlling the shape, movement, and function of astroglial cells.
Increased GFAP immunoreactivity is considered to represent an index of gliosis and gradually developing neural damage
Previous work has shown that overexpression of caspase-6 in the mouse hippocampus increases astrocyte and microglial activation, essential signs of inflammation in the CNS
Here, we show that GFAP is reduced in 5xFAD/C6-KO female mice compared to 5xFAD/C6-Het transgenic mice, but not in male mice (Figure
Additionally, the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1), a marker of activated microglia
These results demonstrate further the effects of caspase-6 activity, or lack-thereof, on a broad spectrum of cells and processes.

Discussion
Caspase-6 inhibition has been a scientific goal for many years in various fields and research labs.
This is due to its broad effect in a myriad of pathologies, from cancer malignancies to neurological disorders, as well as pain and inflammation.
In order to attain a clear picture of the effects of caspase-6 KO on 5xFAD mice, both males and females were tested separately.
Many studies have shown and emphasized the importance of sex differences in animal studies.
Social, anxiety, memory, and locomotor behaviors were all affected by the sex of the animal
Indeed, in the 5xFAD mouse model, a drastic phenotype is observed in aging females, leading to decreased motor behavior and sometimes paralysis and death
In our study, several female mice were humanely euthanized prior to behavior testing, due to weight loss and impaired movement of lower limbs.
Seizures were also observed in several 5xFAD female mice in both Het and KO genotypes
Male mice did not display any seizure or motor impairments at the tested age.
In order to demonstrate that caspase-6 activation has a detrimental role on the severity of AD, we have established a caspase-6 knock-out (KO) colony and cross bred it with 5xFAD AD mice.

Male mice did not display any seizure or motor impairments at the tested age.
In order to demonstrate that caspase-6 activation has a detrimental role on the severity of AD, we have established a caspase-6 knock-out (KO) colony and cross bred it with 5xFAD AD mice.
These served as a new strain of AD mice which were tested in a variety of behavioral, histological, and biochemical exams, in order to evaluate the impact of caspase-6 KO in transgenic AD mice.
Most studies using animal models today usually focus on either male or female mice in order to minimize discrepancies between treatment groups.
However, in mice and specifically in transgenic AD models
This can be observed in cancer or pain studies
Indeed, female mice, as well as humans, are known to be more prone to AD and other types of dementias
The reason for this is not yet fully understood; some research points to menopause
Another study has shown that female mice have higher caspase activation in a stroke model, and drug effects were vastly improved compared to male mice
In our study, gender differences were apparent as well and can be attributed to variance in genetics, inflammatory response, and the mouse model used.
Memory impairments are apparent in the 5xFAD mouse model from an early age and can be evaluated using various behavioral tests.
In the memory test phase of the Y-maze, female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice showed a significant improvement, compared to their transgenic counterpart, and spent more time in the novel introduced arm.
In this test, male mice did not show an improvement over the 5xFAD/C6-Het group.
Reduced anxiety is a well-known characteristic of the 5xFAD model, depicted by a preference toward the open arm of the elevated plus maze
This behavior usually manifests at six months of age
In the current study, male 5xFAD/C6-Het mice did not display the expected behavior, while the 5xFAD/C6-KO group spent 20% of their time in the open arms, exhibiting reduced anxiety.
However, female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice showed a reduction in exploratory behavior closer to the WT groups in the elevated plus maze.
In both the Y-maze and elevated plus maze, 5xFAD/C6-KO female mice performed significantly better than their transgenic counterpart.
This result could indicate that caspase-6 KO has an effect on anxiety-like behaviors and short-term memory in female mice.
The hippocampus is one of the main areas of the brain affected by amyloid deposition and neuronal death in AD brains
This is also the case in the transgenic mouse model
Indeed, both genders of transgenic mice required several days to learn the platform position.
In contrast, both male and female 5xFAD/C6-KO mice showed a rapid learning curve in the MWM, with a significant improvement on the second day of learning.
Male KO mice fared better at finding the platform position, and by the fourth day of learning they surpassed their 5xFAD counterpart.
The probe test also showed significant amelioration in the time spent searching inside the platform zone in both male and female mice.
This test shows amelioration in hippocampal working memory in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice, one of the most affected areas of the brain in AD, and associates caspase-6 activity as a negative effector in the disease.
Previous studies have shown that caspase-6 could mediate synapse dysfunction and loss before the occurrence of neurodegeneration and cell death
Another study used a knock-in mouse that expresses a self-activated form of human caspase-6 in the CA1 and has shown that synaptophysin was reduced when caspase-6 is overexpressed
Therefore, in our study, we wanted to see if knocking out caspase-6 has a beneficial effect on synapse dysfunction.
Analyses of male and female hippocampi revealed a drastic increase in synaptophysin in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice, a protein constituent of synaptic vesicles in neurons, thus suggesting increased synaptic densities.
Increase in synaptophysin expression is correlated with long-term potentiation and may contribute to learning and memory
Inflammation is an integral part of multiple brain diseases
Therefore, we evaluated mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in mice hippocampi and found it to be significantly reduced in 5xFAD/C6-KO male, but not female, mice compared to their transgenic counterpart.
TNF-α is known to be in close relationship with caspase-6, with its expression increasing when caspase-6 is active
An additional cytokine of anti-inflammatory nature, IL-10, is an important negative immune regulator that can counteract damage caused by excessive inflammation
In both caspase-6 KO groups, IL-10 was found to be elevated compared to non-KO groups.
This might suggest an anti-inflammatory process, originally hindered by caspase-6 activity, which could mediate reduced inflammation in KO mice.
In AD, additional pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to be up-regulated, such as IL-6 and IL-1β
IL-6 can lead to induction of APP expression, but can also suppress Aβ deposition in vivo
IL1-β increase in AD is believed to be correlated with memory impairments
On the other hand, IL-1β elevation may induce plaque degradation by increasing microglial activation and phagocytic activity
Gene expression analysis of IL-6 and IL1-β genes in both 5xFAD/C6-KO and 5xFAD/C6-Het mice were significantly elevated compared to that of their WT counterparts.
These cytokines can be up-regulated by different pathways, without the requirement of caspase-6
Amyloid-β plaque deposition, albeit slight controversy, is still to this day considered the main pathology of AD
Reduction in Aβ plaques in transgenic mouse models were regarded as an endpoint for the studies of AD
Caspase-6 has been implicated in aiding in the generation of Aβ plaques
In this experiment, a significant reduction in Aβ aggregate staining was observed in both male and female double transgenic 5xFAD/C6-KO mice, which further demonstrates the link between Aβ and caspase-6 activity in AD.
Reduction in amyloid plaque burden in 5xFAD/C6-KO mice can further attest for the improvement in animal spatial memory and learning behavior, as amyloid-β is in direct correlation with hippocampal memory formation
Microglia, resident macrophages of the neurological system, act as a defense mechanism for the central nervous system.
Together with astrocytes, they create a mesh of activity that leads to inflammation and the progression of AD
In our study, we have shown a reduction in both these neurological hallmarks through immunohistochemistry, which leads us to believe that caspase-6 has a direct effect on microglia and astrocyte activation in this mouse model of AD.
Signaling from microglia through pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, can lead to the activation of apoptosis in neurons through caspase-dependent pathways
In the 5xFAD/C6-KO mice, we see a decrease in both microglia activation, as well as TNF-α gene expression.
Combined with the reduction in pro-apoptotic caspase-3 levels in the hippocampus, we observe a series of reactions that can protect the 5xFAD/C6-KO mice from further neuronal death.
Our study showed that caspase-6 KO has beneficial effects in a mouse model of severe AD, and therefore demonstrates further proof that it plays a fundamental role in the progression and severity of the disease.
Several key behaviors were improved, and protein expressions were affected towards the betterment of AD outcome.
We believe this is additional confirmation that caspase-6 is associated with the pathogenesis of AD at varying stages, and that caspase-6 inhibition can lead to neuronal protection.
Further studies should be performed to expand on caspase-6 inhibition, and to use it as a new target for prevention.

Materials and Methods

Animals
All rodent procedures were approved by the Tel Aviv University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Ref No. 01-17-071, approved 06 September 2017).
Mice were maintained in 12-h-light/12-h-dark conditions in individually ventilated cages with ad libitum access to food and water.
Every effort was made to reduce the number of mice used and minimize their suffering.

5xFAD Mouse Model
The 5xFAD mouse model has three familial AD mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene [K670N/M671L(Swedish)+I716V (Florida)+V717I (London)] and two mutations in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) transgene (M146L+L286V)
Hemizygous transgenic 5xFAD males (JAX #006554) were a generous gift from Professor Dan Frenkel, and WT females (C57BL/6J) were obtained from Envigo (Rehovot, Israel) as breeding pairs.
We bred 5xFAD hemizygous males with C57BL/6J females.
Given that APP and PS1 transgenes co-segregate in 5xFAD mice, offspring were either hemizygous or WT.
Mice were genotyped for both the APP and PS1 transgenes with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using tissue samples obtained via tail piece (AccuStart II Mouse Genotyping Kit -Quanta Bio, Beverly, MA, USA).

Caspase-6 Knock Out Mice
Caspase-6 null (Caspase-6 +/-) mice
Genotyping was performed using the forward and reverse primers provided by Jackson (IMR5940, IMR5941, IMR5942) and following their protocol for Caspase-6 KO mice.

Combination of 5xFAD with Caspase-6 KO
Homozygote males for Caspase-6 KO were bred with 5xFAD female mice to generate Caspase-6 (-/-) and 5xFAD hybrids, as well as wild-type littermates.
Animals were stratified to cages at one month of age according to their genotype and gender.
The final genotypes used in the study are depicted in supplementary Table
Mice were handled periodically, and behavioral testing started at six and a half months of age.

Behavioral Tests

Elevated Plus Maze
The elevated plus maze is generally used for the assessment of anxiety-related behavior.
A plus-shaped maze containing two dark and enclosed arms, and two open and lit arms elevated 100 cm above ground, was used.
The arms were 30 × 5 cm with a 5 × 5 cm center area, and the walls of the closed arms were 40 cm high.
Mice were placed in the center of the maze, tracked for 5 min with a video camera, and then returned to their home cage.
Time spent in the open arms were measured using Ethovision (v11.5, Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands) video tracking system.

Y-maze
Forced alternation Y-maze was performed to assess spatial memory, as previously described
The test was conducted in a white, Perspex Y-shape apparatus with arm length of 38 cm, width of 5 cm, and height of 15 cm.
The test consisted of a sample trial and a test trial.
In the sample trial, the mice were placed at the end of one arm of the maze facing the wall, while one arm of the maze was blocked, and mice could explore the two arms of the maze for 5 min.
The sample trial was followed by a 5 min inter-trial interval.
In the test trial, the mice were returned to the maze with all arms open for another 5 min.
Novel arm exploration time was measured for the duration of the test trial.

Morris Water Maze
Mice were assessed for memory retention and cognition in the Morris water maze (MWM) at seven months of age.
The test consisted of a large pool of water with visual cues and a hidden platform located in the same quadrant throughout the learning phase.
Mice were released from a different quadrant in the pool four times per day for 60 s trials during the four-day learning period.
During the learning phase, mice that did not find the platform were encouraged towards the platform and left untouched for 30 s. Latency to reach the platform was calculated each day as a mean of all trials.
Mice that failed to find the platform were scored as having reached the platform in 60 s.
On the fifth day, the platform was removed, and mice were released from the opposite side for a 60 s probe trial.
Time spent in the platform quadrant was tracked using Ethovision 11.5 software.

Real Time-PCR
Hippocampal RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as previously described
RNA was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Semi-quantitative PCR was performed on the Step-One Real time PCR (RT-PCR) system using Syber-Green Master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and custom designed primers.
Threshold cycle values were determined in triplicates and presented as average, compared with actin.
Fold changes were calculated using the 2∆CT method.

Histology

Sample Preparation
At eight months of age, most animals were euthanized with CO 2 , and the brains were immediately removed.
Hippocampi, pre-frontal cortex, and cerebellum were dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately.
Tissues were kept at -80 • C until use.
These samples were used for western blot analysis and RT-PCR.

Immunohistochemistry
At eight months of age, the remaining animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (MediMarket, Emek Hefer Israel/ Eurovet, Bladel, Netherlands) and transcardially perfused with cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, #158127, Sigma-Aldrich, Jerusalem, Israel).
The brains were then fixed with 4% PFA overnight, equilibrated in 30% sucrose for 48 h, then transferred to PBS Azide (0.02%) solution for preservation until cryo-sectioning.
Brains were sectioned (10 µm) using a cryostat and mounted directly onto slides for analysis.
For immunohistochemistry, slides were incubated with blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.05% Triton-X in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), then incubated overnight at 4 • C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, ab7260, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:500, ab178847, Abcam).
Then, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (1:700, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) for 1 h at RT.
The nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich).
For microscopic analysis, a Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope was used (Leica microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Intensity of fluorescence was measured using ImageJ software (ImageJ software v1.6.0,
NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA).
At least three brains for each group were used for quantification.
Results represent the averages of each group.
For Thioflavin S (ThioS, T1892, Sigma-Aldrich) staining, following the blocking step, slides were incubated for 8 min with 0.01% ThioS solution in 50% ethanol.
Slides were then briefly incubated twice for 10 s with 80% ethanol and washed twice with double distilled water (DDW).

Protein Extraction and Analysis
Tissues were thawed, and homogenized in lysis buffer (200 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM Na2VO4, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 • C. Proteins were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 20 min at 4 • C. Protein concentrations were quantified utilizing the Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Thirty micrograms of protein from each sample was resolved in SDS-PAGE.
Nitrocellulose transferred membranes were blocked for 1 h with PBS 0.1% Tween-20 with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), probed with goat anti synaptophysin antibody (1:1,000, sc-9116, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, United States) overnight at 4 • C, and with goat anti actin antibody (1:5000, MAB1501, Milipore, Burlington, MA, United States) for 1 h at RT, followed by incubation with goat anti Rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000, Licor, Lincoln, NE, United States) for 1 h at RT. Visualization and analysis of band intensities were performed using the Odyssey system (Licor) and the Image Studio Lite 5.2 software.
For each sample, primary antibody results were normalized to actin.

Statistical Analysis
The results are expressed as means ± standard error mean (SEM).
Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test for the direct comparison between two groups.
Statistical analysis of data sets was carried out with the aid of GraphPad Prism 6.01 for Windows (Graphpad Software, CA, USA).
