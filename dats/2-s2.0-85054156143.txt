Cyclophilin D deficiency attenuates mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction via OSCP in Alzheimer's disease
Mitochondrial dysfunction is pivotal in inducing synaptic injury and neuronal stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase deregulation is a hallmark mitochondrial defect leading to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) failure in this neurological disorder.
Oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP) is a crucial F1Fo ATP synthase subunit.
Decreased OSCP levels and OSCP interaction with amyloid β (Aβ) constitute key aspects of F1Fo ATP synthase pathology in AD-related conditions.
However, the detailed mechanisms promoting such AD-related OSCP changes have not been fully resolved.
Here, we have found increased physical interaction of OSCP with Cyclophilin D (CypD) in AD cases as well as in an AD animal model (5×FAD mice).
Genetic depletion of CypD mitigates OSCP loss via ubiquitindependent OSCP degradation in 5×FAD mice.
Moreover, the ablation of CypD also attenuates OSCP/Aβ interaction in AD mice.
The relieved OSCP changes by CypD depletion in 5×FAD mice are along with preserved F1Fo ATP synthase function, restored mitochondrial bioenergetics as well as improved mouse cognition.
The simplest interpretation of our results is that CypD is a critical mediator that promotes OSCP deficits in AD-related conditions.
Therefore, to block the deleterious impact of CypD on OSCP has the potential to be a promising therapeutic strategy to correct mitochondrial dysfunction for AD therapy.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline
Previous studies have repeatedly identified that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark brain pathology underlying AD synaptic injury and neuronal death
Compromised mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) constitutes a characteristic mitochondrial deficit in AD brains, resulting in lowered ATP production and increased oxidative stress, and eventually cell death
The detailed mechanisms of OXPHOS impairment in AD remain as a long-standing scientific issue.
But emerging evidence has accentuated the role of mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction in AD-related mitochondrial OXPHOS failure
Mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase is the executive site for ADP phosphorylation
The dysfunction of this critical mitochondrial enzyme leads to disrupted OXPHOS and progressive ATP depletion.
It is suggested that the AD-related F1Fo ATP synthase deregulation is strongly associated with the aberrations of its key subunit, oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP)
OSCP is part of the peripheral stalk of F1Fo ATP synthase and plays a vital role in maintaining the structural stability of F1Fo complex
Decreased expression of OSCP and the physical interaction of OSCP with amyloid β (Aβ) cause the loss of OSCP function, culminating in the deregulation of F1Fo ATP synthase in AD-related conditions
In this regard, to determine the causative factors for such OSCP dysfunction is of paramount importance to understand mitochondrial OXPHOS defects in AD.
Intriguingly, a previous study on aging mice has shown an unexpected regulation on OSCP expression by Cyclophilin D (CypD; gene name: Ppif), which is evidenced by the observation that the brain aging-related OSCP loss is rescued by genetic depletion of CypD
Given the close relationship of brain aging and AD, it is possible that decreased OSCP expression levels in AD brains are as well a result of CypD effect as increased CypD expression levels are a determined AD brain pathology
Furthermore, CypD has the capacity to bind both OSCP
Of note, the interaction of CypD with OSCP could potentiate F1Fo complex uncoupling
Therefore, Aβ might serve as a key mediator that intensifies the deleterious effect of CypD on OSCP in AD-related conditions.
On the other side, CypD may potentially affect the interaction of OSCP with Aβ.
In this context, we thus hypothesize that CypD may play a crucial role in promoting OSCP changes in AD brains.
To this end, we examine the effect of CypD on OSCP in an AD animal model that mimics AD-like brain amyloidosis (5×FAD mice).
We aim to determine whether CypD is a regulatory factor for OSCP expression and function in Aβ-rich milieus.
In addition, we also examine whether ablation of CypD could be a practical strategy to protect OSCP in ADrelated conditions.

Results

Aβ enhances CypD and OSCP interaction in AD subjects and 5×FAD mice
To determine the status of CypD and OSCP interplay in AD-related conditions, we subjected temporal lobe extracts from AD and nonAD subjects to perform coimmunoprecipitation for CypD and OSCP interaction.
AD cases demonstrated significantly increased CypD/OSCP complexes (Fig.
Next, we examined CypD/OSCP complexes in 5×FAD mice by antibody-based Duolink ® proximity ligation assay (PLA).
PLA is a sensitive method to visualize and quantify tissue-based direct protein interactions in situ
5×FAD mice exhibited substantially increased density of CypD/OSCP complexes in their neocortex in an agedependent manner (Fig.
These results seem to implicate enhanced regulatory effect of CypD on OSCP in AD-related conditions.
Of note, by immunofluorescent staining as well as immuoblotting we have seen an agedependent increase in CypD expression levels (Fig.
Given lowered expression levels of OSCP should disfavor the formation of CypD/OSCP complexes, we then asked whether Aβ promotes OSCP/CypD interaction.
To this end, we employed in vitro pull-down assays using glutathione Stransferase (GST)-tagged OSCP as the bait protein.
As shown in Fig.

CypD deficiency attenuates mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase deregulation in 5×FAD mice
Previous studies indicate the deleterious influence of CypD and OSCP interaction on F1Fo ATP synthase function
If increased CypD/OSCP complex formation as seen in 5×FAD mice underlies F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction, we would expect a protective effect of CypD deficiency.
To this end, we established CypDknockout 5×FAD (Ppif -/-/5×FAD) mice.
Of note, CypD had little impact on the levels of brain Aβ deposition in mice at both tested ages (4 and 9 months old) (Fig.
The similar levels of soluble Aβ1-40 (Fig.
To reflect F1Fo ATP synthase function, we examined F1Fo ATP synthase catalytic activity in neuron-specific synaptic mitochondria.
In sharp contrast to their 5×FAD littermates, CypD-deficient 5×FAD mice exhibited substantially preserved F1Fo ATP synthase enzymatic activity at both 4 and 9 months old of age (Fig.
Further examination of F1Fo ATP synthase coupling assay showed a significant protection by CypD depletion (Fig.
As a result of protected F1Fo ATP synthase function by CypD deficiency, we have observed remarkably improved synaptic mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR) (Fig.
The above results suggest that CypD modulates F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction in AD-related conditions.

CypD promotes OSCP loss via ubiquitination in 5×FAD mice
To determine whether the effect of CypD on neuronal mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase is associated with OSCP, we examined the influence of CypD on OSCP expression in 5×FAD mice.
Purified synaptic mitochondria from nonTg, CypD deficient, 5×FAD and CypD deficient 5×FAD mice at 4 and 9 months old were subjected to immunoblotting assays for OSCP expression.
In parallel, the expression levels of other major F1Fo ATP synthase subunits including α, β, γ, and a, b, c were also measured.
There was little or no genotypic phenotype of CypD deficiency on the expression levels of other major subunits regardless of the presence or absence of Aβ (Fig.
However, CypD deficient 5×FAD mice exhibited remarkably preserved OSCP levels at both tested ages in comparison with their age-and gender-matched 5×FAD littermates (Fig.
This was further confirmed by our experiments using CypD-overexpressing neurons that showed selective decrease in OSCP expression levels (Fig.
Since the proteolysis via the ubiquitin system is a critical pathway for OSCP degradation
As expected, increased OSCP ubiquitination was detected in 5×FAD brains in both 4 and 9 months old mice, which was significantly attenuated by CypD depletion (Fig.
Put together, the results suggest that CypD is a mediator of OSCP loss in 5×FAD mice probably by promoting OSCP degradation via ubiquitination.

CypD promotes OSCP/Aβ interaction in 5×FAD mice
CypD, OSCP and Aβ bind to each other
Since Aβ could alter the binding affinity of CypD with OSCP (Fig.
In this regard, we adopted GST-tagged OSCP as the bait protein and performed in vitro pull down assays to examine the binding affinity of OSCP with Aβ in the absence or presence of CypD.
Intriguingly, we found that the K D of OSCP/Aβ interaction was dramatically decreased from 0.51 ± 0.071 μM (w/o CypD) to 0.088 ± 0.043 μM (with CypD) (Fig.
If this in vitro observation could be extrapolated into an in vivo setting, we would expect to see less OSCP/Aβ complexes in CypD deficient 5×FAD mice.
Indeed, our PLA results showed a significant decrease of OSCP/Aβ complex density in the neocortex of Ppif -/-/5×FAD mice in comparison with their age-and gender-matched 5×FAD littermates at 4 and 9 months old (Fig.
Therefore, together with the observations on OSCP expression our findings indicate that CypD is a critical promoting entity underlying OSCP pathology in AD-relative pathological settings.

CypD deficiency improves cognitive function in 5×FAD mice
The close correlation of mitochondrial dysfunction with cognitive deficits has been repeatedly identified in AD patients as well as AD animal models.
Consistent with alleviated F1Fo ATP synthase function, CypD deficient 5×FAD mice at both tested ages exhibited rescued spatial reference learning and memory (Fig.
The results are in agreement with our previous findings on another AD mouse model (J20 line)

Discussion
As the major source of energy via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondria are essential organelles for neuronal physiology and survival.
In recent years, mitochondrial cascade hypothesis has become a central paradigm in studying Alzheimer's disease (AD), in particular its sporadic form
Compromised mitochondrial OXPHOS is a determined brain pathology that induces synaptic and neuronal stress in this neurological disorder
As a result, the detailed molecular mechanisms of defected mitochondrial bioenergetics in AD have become a critical scientific question.
Recent recognition of mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase deregulation in AD cases and AD animal models has substantially fostered our understanding of the pathogenesis of mitochondrial OXPHOS failure in AD
Importantly, the contribution of OSCP changes to this AD-related F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction has indicated a potential target for AD therapy.
Here, we have found that CypD plays a crucial role in mediating OSCP loss and OSCP/Aβ interaction in AD-related conditions.
The ablation of CypD alleviates these ADassociated OSCP aberrations and further mitigates F1Fo ATP synthase deregulation as well as mitochondrial bioenergetics deficits and cognitive decline in 5×FAD mice.
These findings have suggested a novel therapeutic strategy to protect OSCP and F1Fo ATP synthase in AD.
Moreover, the current research has revealed a key role of CypD in regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, particularly in diseases.
CypD is a mitochondrial peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase)
PPIases are ubiquitous enzymes that affect the structural folding of their substrate proteins by catalyzing the cis/trans isomerisation of peptides immediately preceding proline residues
As a member of PPIase family in mitochondria, CypD is proposed to mediate the folding and rearrangement of mitochondrial proteins such as the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), mitochondrial P53 and many others
In recent years, the impact of CypD on mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase has been highlighted to be a critical mechanism regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics in health and disease
OSCP is one of the determined CypD interacting proteins in F1Fo ATP synthase
The interaction of CypD with OSCP is suggested to induce uncoupling of F1Fo ATP synthase, thus reducing the activity of this pivotal mitochondrial enzyme
This process might play a critical role in modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics at physiological states
But in pathological settings such as brain aging
Therefore, the dual roles of CypD regulation on OSCP in physiology and pathology seem to raise a dilemma, which forms a groundwork for our future investigation to establish a delicate strategy to block excess CypD impact on OSCP while preserving its physiological function.
Of note, although it is not yet clear how CypD interaction with OSCP alters OSCP function, a possible reason is that CypD mediates the rearrangement of OSCP through their physical contact.
Changes in the structural folding of a protein not only influence its function, but also potentially affect its capacity to form complexes with other entities such as proteins, peptides, and/or ions.
This explains our observation that the interaction of CypD with OSCP causes an inclement of OSCP/Aβ interaction.
Indeed, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that increased OSCP/Aβ interaction is at least in part a result of the formation of CypD/ OSCP/Aβ complexes.
Moreover, it should be noted that we have also detected a promoting effect of Aβ on OSCP/CypD interaction.This might be due to increased CypD activity by Aβ, and/or the influence of Aβ on OSCP structure which makes its binding with CypD easier.
Our further study into these issues will help to address the above questions.
Nevertheless, the current results suggest that blockade of CypD has the potential to relieve the deleterious impact of Aβ on OSCP through attenuated Aβ/OSCP interaction.
Another critical finding of this study that merits discussion is the role of CypD in modulating OSCP expression levels.
We have found an inverse relationship between CypD and OSCP in 5×FAD mice.
It should be noted that we have also seen significantly lowered OSCP levels in CypD overexpressing neurons.
Importantly, our unpublished data showed that upregulation of OSCP in neurons in vivo had little influence on CypD levels.
Therefore, the expression levels or the functional status of CypD seems to play a dominant role in regulating OSCP levels.
Although the detailed mechanisms of CypDmediated OSCP downregulation are not yet resolved, our results have suggested OSCP degradation via ubiquitination.
According to the prevailing opinions, the ubiquitindependent proteolysis is not generally accepted to be a pathway for mitochondrial protein degradation.
However, increasing evidence has revealed a role of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of some mitochondrial proteins including OSCP
It is suggested that OSCP undergoes retrograde transport to outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), where OSCP is subsequently degraded via ubiquitination
Indeed, we have found increased ubiquitinated OSCP in 5×FAD mice, suggesting that enhanced OSCP ubiquitination is closely associated with OSCP loss in AD-related conditions.
Moreover, the remarkable inhibition of OSCP ubiquitination by CypD deficiency also adds credit to the hypothesis that there is a potential link between CypD and OSCP degradation.
A possible mechanism is that CypD alters the structure of OSCP and/or promotes OSCP/Aβ interaction, which mediates accelerated OSCP turnover.
Since our understanding of CypD in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis pathway is extremely limited, the detailed mechanisms of CypD-related OSCP degradation needs further study.
In summary, we have established a model in which CypD plays a key role in OSCP aberrations in AD-relative pathological settings, leading to F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction and the resultant mitochondrial defects, eventually causing neuronal injury and death (Fig.
The ablation of CypD has demonstrated significant protection on mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase function as well as mitochondrial bioenergetics.
Indeed, we cannot exclude the protective effects of CypD deficiency is also associated with other mechanisms such as the modulation of mitochondrial protein acetylation
Nevertheless, the results have at least suggested that CypD-mediated OSCP dysfunction is a pivotal mechanism of mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase deregulation and the resultant OXPHOS failure in AD-relative pathological settings.
Therefore, the most parsimonious interpretation of the results is that the interplay between CypD and OSCP in Aβ-rich milieus is a primary AD change that potentially causes mitochondrial defects.

Primary neuron culture was performed using the established protocol.
Briefly, brain tissues were dissected from day 0 pups and immersed in cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma-Aldrich), dissociated with 0.05% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 ºC for 25-30 min followed by 10-15 times trituration.
The cells were filtered through 40μm mesh cell strainer (Fisher brand) and centrifuged for 5min at 280g.
The pellet was gently resuspended in neuron culture medium (Neurobasal A with 2% B27 supplement and 0.5mM L-glutamine, Gibco) and plated on poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) coated culture plates (Corning) or chamber slides (Nunc) with an appropriate density.
10μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the neuron cultures to inhibit non-neuronal cell proliferation.
Neurons were cultured to 12 days in vitro (DIV) for experiment.

CypD overexpression in neurons.
Human CypD cDNA (Gene Name:Ppif -/-NCBI Gene ID: 10105) were inserted in to lentivirus vector with human polyubiquitin promoter-C(Addgene).
Lentiviruses were packaged and applied on primary neurons.
The cells were treated with lentivirus for 5 days followed by their collection in 1X LDS buffer followed by immunblotting.

Behavior studies.
Morris water maze was performed to evaluate the mice spatial learning and reference memory according to previously described protocol
Briefly, mice were trained to find a submerged platform in an open swimming arena.
Repeated trials (n = 4) were performed each day for 11 days by starting the mice at different random start locations (NW, N, NE, E, SE) while platform was fixed at a single location (SW).
Each trial lasted 60 seconds with an additional 30 seconds learning time where mice were allowed to remain on the platform.
After 11 days of learning, mice were subjected to a probe test in which the platform was removed.
Mice were analyzed for number of times they passed previous learning time platform location (SW).
HVS Image 2015 software (HVS Image) determined swimming speeds and analyzed the behavior data.
In response to Aβ deposition in AD brain mitochondria, CypD expression levels increase, which may promote OSCP reduction.
Such changes potentiate elevated CypD/Aβ, CypD/ OSCP and OSCP/Aβ interactions, leading to F1Fo ATP synthase dysfunction.
The deregulation of this critical mitochondrial enzyme compromises mitochondrial OXPHOS efficacy and causes other mitochondrial defects including increased oxidative stress and calcium perturbations.
Finally, the neuronal mitochondrial stress results in neuronal injury and eventually neurodegeneration.
