The Influence of Genetic Factors and Cognitive Reserve on Structural and Functional Resting-State Brain Networks in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers significant insight into the complex organization of neural networks within the human brain.
Using resting-state functional MRI data, topological maps can be created to visualize changes in brain activity, as well as to represent and assess the structural and functional connections between different brain regions.
Crucially, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with progressive loss in this connectivity, which is particularly evident within the default mode network.
In this paper, we review the recent literature on how factors that are associated with risk of dementia may influence the organization of the brain network structures.
In particular, we focus on cognitive reserve and the common genetic polymorphisms of APOE and BDNF Val66Met.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, it was estimated that more than 47 million elderly people are affected by dementia globally
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive condition causing behavioral changes, memory loss, and decline in learning capacity
Most cases of AD occur in individuals over the age of 75, but, relatively younger individuals, including those carrying certain genetic mutations
Knowledge of the brain changes that occur in AD has increased remarkably from the late 20th century due to extensive research on a range of related neurodegenerative processes.
Particular progress has been made with regard to what has been termed the pathological 'hallmarks' of ADthe presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) -which detrimentally affect axons, dendrites, and synapses
Plaques are the result of accumulations of an abnormal form of the beta amyloid (Aβ) protein in the brain.
NFTs are formed by the aggregation of aberrant tau protein
Within the cerebral cortex, the earliest plaques are usually found in the neocortex, whilst initial formation of tangles occurs in medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, such as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus
The MTL is a very important region responsible for memory formation and long-term memory
Throughout the cerebral cortex, neurons that provide long corticocortical connections are the most prone to NFTinduced deterioration
Entorhinal-hippocampal circuits are compromised early in AD, followed by the gradual disconnection of the MTL, and then the loss of connectivity between association neocortices
This pattern of progressive and degenerative pathology may underlie the deterioration of certain cognitive functions during aging, leading eventually to frank AD.
The early pathological accumulation of Aβ has been linked to cognitive impairment and could also affect functional connectivity between spatially distant brain regions
A summary table of studies examining functional connectivity and Aβ in healthy aging and AD can be found in Table
Neuroimaging is a vital component of international research collaborations
A better understanding of how the pathological changes in AD affect the organization of brain networks, or how these networks may respond or adapt to accumulating pathology, might offer further insights into the potential scope of functional resilience.
The term resilience is described as the capability of a tissue to be resistant to damage
In this respect, factors such as education and lifestyle could increase resilience by heightened connectional redundancy and/or preserving functional connections in the brain, and may ultimately delay the clinical expression of AD pathology.
Indeed, studies investigating the association of education and cognitive decline in AD have found that more highly educated individuals are able to tolerate more neuropathology before the clinical expression of AD
Studies have shown that functional connectivity is damaged or interrupted in AD
This review focuses on the methods with which brain connectivity is analyzed, the changes in structural and functional networks found in AD, and the role of cognitive reserve and specific genetic factors in partially determining functional brain connectivity.
In this regard, potential changes in functional connectivity and resistance to pathology will involve both non-modifiable and modifiable factors that will impact on how brain systems respond to accumulating pathological burden.
Hence, we discuss features of structural and functional brain networks in relation to genetic biomarkers and environmental factors linked to AD risk, progression and resilience.

METHODS TO ANALYZE CONNECTIVITY
Neuroimaging techniques (Figure
MRI involves the generation of a strong static magnetic field to create images and to map fluctuation signals related to brain activity
MRI also allows the quantification of brain atrophy, which can be used to distinguish normal brain aging from AD
For example, a recent study found that MRI and cognitive testing in cognitively healthy individuals are useful tools for predicting the development of AD, particularly when investigating the progress from healthy cognition to the appearance of mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) after 5 years
The delayed presence of clinical symptoms makes it challenging to diagnose individuals in preclinical stages.
Therefore, animal models could provide an opportunity to identify biomarkers of early disease
Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI-based neuroimaging method that measures the diffusion of water molecules, enabling the assessment of the fiber-tract structures of white matter
This technique allows the strengths and differences of white matter tract connections in specific population groups to be compared
Other structural imaging parameters that are currently used to gain further insight into the integrity of the brain over the life include intracranial volume and the presence and number of white matter hyper-intensities (Bartrés-Faz and Arenaza-Urquijo, 2011).
Functional MRI (fMRI) permits simultaneous monitoring of the activity of different brain regions while a subject is at rest or performing a task
In fMRI, oxygen in blood is measured through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals
Specifically, the underlying premise is that more oxygen is required for greater neuronal activity, thereby creating a signal that can be detected using fMRI (Figure
Thus, it is possible to measure changes in oxygen concentration, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV) that are delayed by 1-2 s after MRI excitation.
This is referred to as the hemodynamic response
If the BOLD signal from different areas of the brain show similar and synchronized activity, it is assumed that these regions communicate with each other and transfer information, which is defined as functional connectivity
Functional connections, defined as temporal correlations between spatially distant cortical brain regions, are revealed through fluctuations in low-frequency portions of BOLD signals
With age, functional connectivity networks gradually decrease
Resting-state fMRI is an increasingly frequent method employed to study differences between various cohorts and involves the investigation of the activity of the brain while the individual is at rest and not performing a task.
Resting-state fMRI can be used to determine how different brain regions operate and process information in functional space.
Additional advantages are that resting-state fMRI is less demanding on the individual and easier to apply than task-related fMRI
The individual is instructed to not fall asleep while keeping their eyes closed in a lying position.
There are a variety of approaches for analyzing resting-state fMRI.
For instance, seed-based analysis
In AD, the precuneus has showed decreased functional connectivity to other brain regions, such as the left hippocampus, left parahippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex and gyrus rectus, as compared to non-dementia controls
The investigation of simultaneous neuronal connections across the brain is called independent component analysis (ICA),  and is a wholly data-driven form of analysis
Using ICA-based analysis,
Another technique used to examine resting-state functional connectivity is graph analysis, which employs a way of specifically visualizing the complex interactions in the brain
Using graph theory, functional connectivity is represented as a series of 'nodes' (voxels) and 'edges' (correlated activity between nodes)
It has been predicted that small-world networks in human fMRI studies with low-frequency oscillation might reveal connectivity of the brain structure.
A specific focus of this form of analysis in network organization is the average minimum number of edges that must be traversed between any two nodes in a brain network, referred to as 'effective path length.'
The characteristics of small-world networks are clustering coefficient, high integration and their typical feature is shorter effective path length
Cluster coefficient is described as a measurement of nodes that are locally interconnected
This approach is particularly useful when measuring and comparing differences in structural and functional connectivity
A further advantage of graph theory analysis is that it makes no assumptions about how close any two nodes are in space.

CHANGES IN STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN AD Structural Connectivity
In AD, the loss of connections between neurons can result in other structural alterations, such as atrophy, hypometabolism, and NFT accumulation
Significant atrophy in AD, identified through MRI, occurs in the posterior hippocampus and the temporal and parietal cortices, which are three of the structures that are involved in the default mode network (DMN;
The default mode is a network in the brain that is activated when individuals are not engaged in a task, but are spontaneously thinking of past or future events
The DMN is a highly interconnected set of cortical regions that demonstrate substantial correlated activity, particularly when the attentional network is inactive
Diffusion tensor imaging studies investigating white matter changes in individuals with AD have demonstrated that the disease causes a deterioration of white matter fiber bundles in the MTL
Similarly, in an animal model, López-Gil et al. (
Moreover,
In cognitively healthy individuals with elevated Aβ in the brain, potentially the pathological correlate of early AD, structural changes appear similar to individuals with MCI in terms of the topology of structural network connectivity
Interestingly, these individuals with high brain Aβ load despite no overt cognitive symptomatology, demonstrated increased shortest path length in white matter networks in the absence of major neurodegenerative features such as atrophy or reduction of cortical glucose
Finally, the structural networks (or nodes) of individuals with AD who possessed fewer connections (or edges) were more susceptible to global disruption of white matter tracts than individuals with more connections
In addition, a rat transgenic model bearing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes also demonstrated a reduction of local and global efficiency, as well as less clustering as compared to non-transgenic rats
Moreover,
In summary, changes in structural connectivity could be useful in predicting the degradation of white matter bundles, as well as the strength of functional connectivity networks

Functional Connectivity
Performance within many domains of cognitive function decreases slowly with age, but, importantly, higher cognitive performance has been correlated with increased functional connectivity in older adults
Compared to animal studies, transgenic AD rat models require longer cognitive training to achieve the same performance as non-transgenic rats.
Although the structural network was changed, these alteration did not result in functional network differences proposing associations between the capability to learn and the reorganization of functional networks in the brain
Nevertheless, a gradual decrease in functional connectivity among the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is expected with age
It has been proposed that disconnection of functional networks in the brain, such as those observed in AD, could serve as critical markers for the presence of early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly with regard to the abnormal accumulation of Aβ in the brain
Resting-state studies have reported a decrease in functional connectivity in healthy older individuals with Aβ burden in the posteromedial regions, ventral medial PFC, right angular gyrus, and the left middle and superior frontal gyri
Early accumulation of Aβ in older healthy individuals, particularly in the precuneus, has been suggested to result in impairment in hippocampal function
In contrast,
Specifically, the authors found that there was increased connectivity in regions of the right dorsal PFC, left anterior medial PFC and left temporal cortices, as well as decreased DMN connectivity in several posteromedial regions, the ventral medial PFC, right angular gyrus, and the left frontal gyri
Disruption within the DMN has also been found in healthy older individuals with high amyloid burden
Interestingly, these healthy individuals (n = 38) exhibited the same amount of Aβ burden compared to half of the individuals with MCI (n = 46) and all individuals with AD (n = 35).
Such associations have also been investigated in animal models.
Interestingly, in transgenic AD mouse model involving cortical amyloidosis, it has been shown that an age-related decrease in functional connectivity in specific brain regions is more severe in the presence of higher Aβ deposition
A study investigating whole-brain connectivity found abnormalities in cortical hubs of the temporo-parietal cortex and precuneus/PCC in healthy mild cognitive impaired subjects with Aβ burden
In general, greater atrophy has been related to less brain connectivity
For example, a study by
Disconnection between functional networks could be an essential biomarker for AD.
For instance, individuals with AD exhibit disruption of functional connectivity between the inferior lateral temporal cortex (ITC), precuneus, right thalamus and the PCC
This pattern of disconnection is likely associated with impairments in memory, processing speed and executive function
Another proposed early biomarker for AD could lie in the disruptions that have been identified within the visual cortices, specifically the impairments in connectivity between the PCC and the dorsal and ventral visual pathways
These changes have been suggested to lead to deteriorating visual function in AD
Small-world network analysis in AD has shown longer path length in the central, temporal, and frontal brain regions as compared to age-matched, non-demented individuals
Decreased local connectedness within networks, also called clustering, has also been reported in individuals with AD, and correlated with lower cognitive performance
This finding led
A recent study found support for this notion by demonstrating that individuals with MCI and AD had a longer characteristic path length compared to healthy controls
Moreover, AD appeared to be associated with a greater number of edges connecting to a node regionally, as well as increases and decreases in the efficiency of local nodes when compared to the controls
To understand these differences in network topology, it is necessary to account for genetic variations that might affect the organization of the brain and which may also be linked to neurodegeneration in AD (Figure

ROLE OF GENETIC FACTORS RELATED TO AD IN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY Apolipoprotein E (APOE)
The inheritance of gene-related factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), in particular the APOE ε4 allele, is associated with an increased risk of AD
Resting-state fMRI studies have reported diverging associations of APOE polymorphisms and functional connectivity in healthy individuals that may relate to the age of the sample groups
For example, APOE ε4 alleles have been associated with both increased and decreased DMN functional connectivity in cognitively healthy individuals
Comparing non-demented middle-aged (50-65 years) individuals carrying the APOEε4 with non-carriers, ε4 carriers showed elevated functional connectivity in the middle frontal gyrus, whilst non-ε4 carriers had greater functional connectivity in the right medial frontal gyrus
Conversely,
Additionally, a decrease in interhemispheric functional connectivity within the DMN was found in healthy elderly APOEε4 carriers (65-80 years of age;
Notably, most of these regions are also affected in AD, which emphasizes the significance of the involvement of the DMN in the preclinical phase of AD
More recently,
Interestingly, greater functional connectivity was observed in both the APOEε4 carriers and in the APP/presenilin-1/2 group as compared to healthy controls.
This increased connectivity was found between the left hippocampus and the bilateral medial PFC/precuneus.
Only APOEε4 carriers displayed increased connectivity between the right hippocampus and the left middle temporal gyrus.
Here, the authors have suggested that the 'beneficial' effect of APOE ε4 in functional connectivity in younger individuals may be due to mechanisms of compensation of cognitive disruptions, which may be detrimental as the individual ages.
Due to inconsistencies in published evidence, it is important to consider how APOE polymorphisms may be associated with other measures of functional connectivity.
Studies that have investigated APOE effects in small-world networks have reported higher susceptibility of fewer functional hubs and reduced centrality in healthy older ε4 carriers compared to non-ε4 carriers
Regional cerebral glucose metabolism, clustering of whole-brain functional networks, and path length have all been reported to be decreased in ε4 carriers
However, in a study with a greater sample size of 147 cognitively normal individuals, more clustering and longer path lengths were identified in ε4 carriers when compared to non-carriers
Non-demented ε4carriers also had more long-distance connections in the parietal and temporal lobes, whilst non-ε4 carriers exhibited more short-distance connections in the parietal and occipital lobe.
Healthy older individuals with the ε4 allele also had less shortdistance connections in the frontal lobe connections, while both groups showed more long-distance connections in the frontal lobe
In summary, this study found the brain networks of those carrying APOEε4 to be organized into an abnormal structure when compared to non-carriers, with fewer connections in the frontal lobe and more structural long length connections, which could partially explain the negative APOE ε4 cognitive phenotype.

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)
Another genetic factor related to AD is the BDNF gene
The BDNF protein belongs to the family of nerve growth factors, which affect neurogenesis
Post-mortem studies of AD have shown that BDNF protein levels are decreased in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, temporal, frontal, and parietal cortex when compared to cognitively intact age-matched controls
Lower BDNF levels may be related to volume loss in the hippocampus
BDNF concentration is highly variable between individuals and is relative to physiological state; for example, after physical exercise, peripheral blood BDNF concentration is increased
A recent review supported this finding by reporting increased neurogenesis and plasticity in the hippocampus in rats and mice after treadmill exercise, which led to improved shortand long-term memory functions
A common single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene, specifically a valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met), has an influence on LTP as well as activity-dependent BDNF secretion
BDNF Val66Met has been associated with cognitive performance as well as with AD brain morphology.
In particular, the BDNF Met gene carriers (aged 60 and older), which were in preclinical stages of AD, demonstrated reduced memory function and smaller hippocampal and temporal lobe volume as compared to Val homozygotes
Authors also observed that more physical exercise was related to larger hippocampal and temporal lobe volumes in Val homozygotes but not in Met carriers
Notably, in Met carriers, physical activity was linked to reduced volumes of the temporal lobe, which is likely due to more apoptotic alterations
Likewise,
Studies have proposed that there might be a relationship between Aβ and BDNF Val66Met, in which the BDNF polymorphism might mediate the effects on Aβ neurotoxicity on the brain
Relative to Val homozygotes with a low Aβ load, Val homozygotes with a high Aβ load also experienced reduced cognitive performance, indicating that being a Val homozygote would not necessary protect against cognitive decline
In older adults with late-onset depression, BDNF Met carriage was associated with reduced resting-state functional connectivity between the bilateral hippocampus and cerebellum
BDNF Met carriers with late-onset depression also had reduced strong (positive) functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the temporal cortex; however, there was also evidence of increased anti-correlated (negative) functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal-lateral PFC, and angular gyrus
Similarly,
Finally,
The authors targeted nodes and edges in their analysis and simulated manipulation of the white matter networks.
They demonstrated that Val homozygotes were more robust and resistant to gray matter damage compared to Met carriers
Studies of white matter networks determined that BDNF Met carriers were more susceptible to node disruptions than Val homozygotes
The interaction of the BDNF Met and APOEε4 polymorphisms was investigated by
Here, the authors found that BDNF Met alleles were associated with poorer cognitive performance, predominantly in memory and semantic fluency.
In support,
This cumulative effect may be influencing the functional brain networks and reduce connections between different brain regions.
BDNF Met carriers may have fewer connections compared to BDNF Val homozygotes (Figure
In a separate study, BDNF Met/APOEε4 carriers with high brain Aβ levels demonstrated a faster rate of decline over a 54month period in verbal and visual episodic memory and language processing when compared to BDNF Met/non-APOE ε4 carriers
In comparison, BDNF Val/ε4 carriers with a high Aβ burden demonstrated a relatively mild reduction in cognitive functioning.
In BDNF Met/APOEε4 carriers with high Aβ load, memory deficits are detectable after 3 years, whereas it takes 10 years in APOEε4-/BDNF Val homozygotes with a high Aβ load to reach the same clinical threshold
A recent meta-analysis investigated the relationship between APOE and BDNF Val66Met and concluded that there were more women with AD carrying the BDNF Met polymorphism
However, no significant relationships between APOEε4 carriers and BDNF Met carriers were identified in the overall analysis that included both men and women with AD.
APOE and BDNF polymorphisms may interact with each other and possibly influence functional connectivity.
BDNF Met carriers with the APOE ε4 allele exhibited decreased brain activation in the MTL
Atrophy, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, and acceleration of AD pathology, has been linked to poor compensation mechanisms of the brain in individuals with BDNF Met carrying the APOEε4
The authors observed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, but not APOE variants, moderated the relationship between executive function and cognitive reserve, in which exposure to a more cognitively enriched environment was associated with better executive functioning in Val homozygotes but not in Met carriers
In another study,
An explanation for these results is that cognitive reserve could have varying cognitive effects depending on the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism
Altogether, experimental studies indicate that the BDNF polymorphism influences key neurobiological processes associated with development and activity-dependent learning

COGNITIVE RESERVE AND BRAIN CONNECTIVITY
It is possible that common variation in the BDNF gene may result in differences in the development and maintenance of structural and functional networks throughout the life course, which ultimately may be associated with either better or worse brain resilience to neurodegenerative disease processes, such as in AD.
Given the role of BDNF in development and adult brain plasticity, it is also possible that this gene variation may have an influence on the construction of patterns of connectivity that underlie resistance to pathology, perhaps related to the theoretical construct of cognitive reserve
Brain or neural reserve, which is often referred to as the 'passive' model of reserve, focuses on anatomical brain structures, especially brain size and the number and architecture of neurons and synapses
This model, later revised by
The brain reserve model suggests that most of its capacity is established in the early years of life, usually by the age of five
Nevertheless, investigations have demonstrated that brain reserve may be modifiable.
For example, the brains of adult monkeys are able to form and renew cells throughout life
The 'active' model of reserve is often referred to as 'cognitive reserve, ' which is a hypothetical construct that relates to the functional resilience of the brain against accumulating pathological changes
According to the theory of cognitive reserve, brains with more complex neural networks have a higher level of inbuilt redundancy, which are subsequently able to compensate for degenerative or lost neurons
Factors such as lifetime experience, educational and occupational attainment, and socioeconomic status are posited to play a significant role in the development of cognitive reserve
For example, individuals with AD and higher cognitive reserve (education levels) had greater DMN connectivity compared to individuals with AD and lower education levels
Furthermore, although
Lifelong engagement in cognitively stimulating activities may reduce the risk of developing dementia by 40%
In support,
In human studies,
Similarly, in healthy participants (50-79 years), education later in life (university study for at least 12 months) was positively associated with cognitive reserve (as estimated by current psychological assessment scores) compared to those who did not complete any further university education
Associations between education and age are evident particularly in the attention and speed processing domains
In line with these findings,
This notion of neural flexibility could potentially be demonstrated in re-organizable functional networks of the brain observed in cognitively healthy individuals
In this study of healthy older individuals, higher cognitive reserve was associated with increased brain activity in the DMN, but it was also associated with decreased brain activity in regions associated with speech comprehension.
In contrast, in individuals with MCI or AD, decreased activation in the DMN and more activation in language processing in subjects was associated with higher cognitive reserve
Education and cognitive reserve have a positive effect on functional connectivity networks
There is evidence that high cognitive reserve levels were related to working memory, while age had a negative effect on cognition
High cognitive reserve has been associated with greater functional connectivity in healthy elderly individuals
Arenaza-Urquijo et al. (
In particular, the authors found higher functional connectivity in regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex, right hippocampus, right PCC, left inferior frontal lobe and left angular gyrus in people with those with more education.
These enlarged networks were connected to all lobes in each hemisphere and influenced functional connections in a positive way, which was predicted to moderate the effects of age on brain connectivity
Moreover,
The authors demonstrated that the DEM had a positive effect locally (in the neighborhood areas), on the strength of nodes, efficiency and on clustering coefficient, exhibiting greater communication within the networks of the occipital and parietal lobe areas.
There was also a relationship found between the DEM and network transitivity indicating that individuals with more education use different neural processing
Network transitivity is defined as the connection between two nodes that are linked to each other via an edge in a network.
In addition,
They demonstrated that larger networks with more functional connections in the brain were related to higher cognitive reserve.
Greater local efficiency and higher local clustering in the cuneus, as well as in the areas of the superior and middle occipital lobe were related to higher levels of cognitive reserve
The inferior temporal gyrus is predicted to have a significant role for cognitive reserve, because of its betweenness centrality and nodal strength, which demonstrated a positive correlation with cognitive reserve.
The fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through a given node is called betweenness centrality
The inferior temporal gyrus is a significant hub responsible for recognition and visualization of words and numbers
Finally, global efficiency, which is "a measure of functional integration"
Findings in all subgroups showed greater functional brain activation in the anterior cingulate in the left hemisphere while performing a cognitively stimulating task (e.g., recognition memory task).
However, the cognitively healthy older adult group demonstrated greater activation in several brain regions as compared to the aMCI and AD groups.
These activated brain regions included the left anterior cingulate and left precuneus, the right cingulate gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus of the dorsolateral PFC, all of which are susceptible to degenerative changes in individuals diagnosed with AD and aMCI
Functional connectivity was associated with the cognitive reserve proxy, education, within the DMN.
Higher functional connectivity within the PCC was associated with higher education in individuals with AD, in which education possibly initiated mechanism of compensation.
Education may also have led to brain plasticity and supported the PCC from atrophying.
Some of the aMCI group exhibited similar connectivity strength, however, there was no strong functional connectivity found in the healthy group
Individuals with more years of education and prodromal AD were able to compensate for fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET hypometabolism in the precuneus and had greater connectivity in the left frontal lobe, as well as better performance in memory
Moreover,
Negative connectivity between the left lateral frontal cortex and the DMN was also found in people with MCI who had achieved higher education
The greatest impact in agerelated alterations later in life was found in the sensorimotor networks, especially those underlying processing speed and attention
In summary, education early in life and other life-long cognitively stimulating activities could be possible protectors against neurodegenerative diseases, and might bolster cognitive reserve later in life

CONCLUSION
The brain is a large set of complex networks that are connected structurally and functionally.
Different areas of the brain share and communicate information in functional space, creating networks.
These networks can be adversely or positively influenced by various genetic and environmental factors.
For instance, studies reported that APOE ε4 was associated with decreased functional connectivity
However, there was also decreased path length
Similarly, healthy older BDNF Met carriers were associated with reduced functional connectivity, while Val homozygotes showed a more robust network in the brain structure
Cognitive activities and environmental enrichment have favorable effects on BDNF Val homozygotes, and over time also on BDNF Met carriers
In general, studies provided evidence that education and cognitive reserve are associated with an increase of functional connectivity in the brain networks
This could potentially affect brain networks in a positive way and may mitigate and protect against cognitive impairments later in life, and hopefully delay or even prevent the onset of AD
Future studies should investigate whether cognitive reserve and environmental enrichment work as compensatory mechanisms to influence and alter the networks of more susceptible genetic polymorphisms to AD, such as APOE ε4 and BDNF Met carriers.
Education later in life increases cognitive reserve and could provide more resistance and resilience to brain pathology.
Overall, these findings indicate that the functional networks of the brain are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
An improved understanding of these relationships is vital in order to fully grasp how neurodegenerative changes affect brain function, but also to determine how cognitive resilience to neurodegenerative changes may be promoted.
