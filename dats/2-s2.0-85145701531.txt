Trilateral association of autophagy, mTOR and Alzheimer’s disease: Potential pathway in the development for Alzheimer’s disease therapy
The primary and considerable weakening event affecting elderly individuals is age-dependent cognitive decline and dementia.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the chief cause of progressive dementia, and it is characterized by irreparable loss of cognitive abilities, forming senile plaques having Amyloid Beta (Aβ) aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles with considerable amounts of tau in affected hippocampus and cortex regions of human brains.
AD affects millions of people worldwide, and the count is showing an increasing trend.
Therefore, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms at molecular levels to generate novel insights into the pathogenesis of AD and other cognitive deficits.
A growing body of evidence elicits the regulatory relationship between the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and AD.
In addition, the role of autophagy, a systematic degradation, and recycling of cellular components like accumulated proteins and damaged organelles in AD, is also pivotal.
The present review describes different mechanisms and signaling regulations highlighting the trilateral association of autophagy, the mTOR pathway, and AD with a description of inhibiting drugs/molecules of mTOR, a strategic target in AD.
Downregulation of mTOR signaling triggers autophagy activation, degrading the misfolded proteins and preventing the further accumulation of misfolded proteins that inhibit the progression of AD.

Introduction
Many individuals above 65 years of age tend to suffer from a general progressive neurodegenerative disorder called Alzheimer's disease (AD)
The disorder includes the formation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) aggregates as a result of proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and, to date, has no effective treatment
Age is the prime risk factor for the progression of AD, the prevalent type of dementia spreading across the world, where 40 million individuals are affected
In terms of genetics, AD-inherited patients show the presence of a mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene with an autosomal dominant trait and mutated presenilin genes.
Clinically, AD is also illustrated by cognitive impairment, overproduction of Aβ aggregates, and tau protein's hyperphosphorylation in many basic research studies.
AD is a gradually progressive neurodegenerative disease prominently consisting of 1) neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (Figure
AD, an essential type of dementia, mainly affects various brain functions like behavior, thinking, and memory.
These symptoms, in due course, increase the worsening of daily activities.
Memory is lost when 1) crucial meetings are forgotten, 2) familiar tasks such as cooking, driving, writing, and speaking are disoriented, and 3) varied mood swings and withdrawal from relations and family happens
In addition, many risk factors are correlated with AD, making it a multifactorial disease (Figure
Autophagy, defined as "self-eating," is a self and systematic degradable process occurring within the cell for recycling cellular components like protein aggregates, misfolded proteins, and unwanted cell organelles
Recent studies on AD mainly focus on autophagy's contribution to its pathology
Like other cells, neurons can gather toxic substances/organelles during senescence and require autophagy activation to maintain cell homeostasis
A recent study reported that autophagy-related genes, namely ATG18, ATG8a, and ATG1 in Drosophila melanogaster insect model, are down-regulated with age and neuron dysfunction
The autophagic flux represents the complete dynamic steps of autophagy including autophagosome formation, maturation, fusion with lysosomes, and subsequent breakdown, followed by the release of macromolecules back into the cytosol
The autophagy pathway includes releasing various factors, proteins, and signaling molecules.
It is associated with other signaling pathways like adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK), Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and insulin signaling.
The pictorial representation of the autophagy pathway in Homo sapiens retrieved from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database is shown in Figure
AD worsens with aging, expressing its symptoms and affecting many brain functions, among which cognitive dysfunction (loss of synapses) and memory loss are prominent
In AD, extracellular senile plaques have amyloid beta particles and intraneural NFT, constituting the major part of aggregated MAPT/Tau protein
The focus on the defects of autophagic flux in AD will not only update the current monitoring methods but also provide visions for developing autophagy-related therapeutics for treating the disease.
Through the mTOR signaling, beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are accumulated by altering APP metabolism and upregulating β and γ secretases while the mTOR inhibits autophagy function.
Moreover, dysregulation of mTOR is allied with many human diseases, like cancer and neurological and metabolic diseases
The mTOR is a member of the phosphoinositide-3-kinaserelated family with conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase and can respond to environmental stimuli like nutrient concentration, energy state, and growth factors
mTOR is significant for cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, protein translation, and autophagy.
Several studies on AD pathology are supported by ample evidence, stressing the association between AD and mTOR signaling
The present review is on the divergent mechanistic regulations of autophagy and mTOR proteins, the available inhibitors for mTOR, and how all these combined factors apply to AD's treatment.

The role of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease
Autophagy is a highly conserved pathway for degrading longlived intracellular proteins, protein aggregates, and organelles (e.g., mitochondrial) via lysosomes to maintain homeostasis under physiological conditions
Many studies have reported that altered autophagy is directly related to multiple chronic diseases, including AD. Inducing autophagy may therefore result in the removal of Aβ accumulations
Moreover, chaperone-mediated autophagy and mitophagy have also been associated with AD
The body of scientific evidence suggests the impact of defective mitophagy in the aggregation of faulty autophagosomal vacuoles.
Calcium ion imbalance, altered pH, and increased oxidative stress play an important role in this faulty mitochondrial dysfunction mechanism leading to AD progression
Mutations occurring in these genes may result in an impaired mitophagy process leading to the clustering of defective autophagosomal vacuoles
Another study proposed that mutations in the PSEN1 gene might induce an altered autophagy/mitophagy pathway.
This mutation can lead to reduced lysosomal hydrolase activity accelerating the lysosome alkalization resulting in AD
Alteration of the autophagy-lysosome pathway contributes to APP
This step also eventually inhibits MAPT/tau aggregates degradation
Autophagy is critical in regulating inflammation, where autophagy inducers can also cause glial cells' autophagy via neuron cross-talks
Characterization of autophagy-lysosomes impairment in various AD stages, molecules, and genetic types may also pave the way to generate avenues for novel therapeutics.
In another in vitro model study, the overexpression of let-7b promoted Aβ1-40 to trigger the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway in neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells, subsequently inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis
Some evidence also emphasizes that uncontrolled Aβ accumulations generated more neurotoxicity and progression of AD
Investigation on Aβ neurotoxicity usually represents SK-N-SH cells and Aβ1-40 as the AD's cell models
In AD cells, the removal of abnormal protein aggregates can be achieved by utilizing autophagy mechanisms
Lysosomal acidification and the dysregulation of the V-ATPase complex are common metabolic interruptions associated with AD
But, recent study findings reveal the defective acidification of autolysosomes may induce faulty autophagic build-up of Aβ in neurons
Therefore, autophagy-stimulating agents/drugs, like mTOR inhibition, remain a potential therapeutic agent for AD without altering the autophagy-lysosomal pathway.

Dysregulation of mTOR pathway in AD conditions
mTOR is a 289-kD Ser/Thr multidomain protein with an FKBP12 binding and kinase domain which controls many physiological processes.
mTOR coordinates the upstream signaling components such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), growth factors, insulin, AMPK, and PI-3K/Akt
AD pathogenesis depends on both the downand upstream regions of mTOR signaling
Several research studies have highlighted the dysregulation of the mTOR pathway in other diseases like cancer and diabetes
In fact, some reports stated that mTOR activation contributes to AD progression and interferes with the clinical manifestation and AD pathology
Hyperactivated mTOR, the able cause of AD, is regulated with various upstream signaling cascades like GSK3, AMPK (PI3-K)/Akt, and IGF-1.
It is also observed that many diseases like mitochondrial dysfunction, auto-immunity, and cancer affect these pathways, causing uncontrolled stimulation of mTOR and leading to tau protein hyperphosphorylation.
The phenomenon leads to the formation of NFTs and paired helical filaments (PHFs), the characteristic symptom of AD.
Additionally, Aβ plaques are also formed due to the direct inhibition of autophagy by mTOR activation, which induces tau protein hyperphosphorylation and mTOR activities, thus enhancing the advancement of AD
Furthermore, it was reported that mitochondrial and nuclear DNA oxidation in AD brains occur with increased levels of 8oxo-2-dehydroguaninie, 5-hydroxyuracil, and 8-hydroxyadenine in temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes of AD brains
Likewise, in hippocampus regions of AD brains, heavy levels of 8-hydroxyguanine were also reported
Rapamycin was found to simultaneously inhibit mTOR protein kinase and stimulates autophagy
The study's qualitative and quantitative histological findings and morphometric methods revealed a significant reduction in the disease's symptomatic effects of tau in the perforant pathway upon chronic systematic rapamycin treatment.
Henceforth, the progression in the early stages of AD can be addressed by lowering the tau toxicity effect (Figure
Under controlled conditions, decreased levels of free radical or reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Aβ aggregates coordinate stress responses like ubiquitin protease system (UPS), autophagy, and unfolded protein response (UPR) and remove damaged cell organelles and other compounds.
Under diseased conditions, ROS are overproduced for the control of protein quality leading to the formation of more oxidized proteins because of protein dysfunction and also leading to the dysregulation of insulin signaling

Trilateral association between autophagy, mTOR signaling, and Alzheimer's disease
During the persistent circumstance of AD pathology, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1) regulation is lost, resulting in aggregate formation inside the cell.
Indeed, the levels of eukaryotic Initiative Factor 4E (eIF4E)

These alterations correlate with Braak staging and tau pathology resulting in protein translation disorder.
The cognitive decline during AD and mTOR hyperactivation co-exists
In addition, the levels of phosphate and tensin homologue (PTEN) immunoreactive neurons are decreased in the temporal cortex and hippocampus regions of AD-affected brains showing a negative correlation with senile plaque and NFT formations
The PI3K/Akt signaling is attenuated by PTEN, followed by the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5triphosphate (PIP3), resulting in the Akt signal hyperactivation to trigger the mTORC1 activity further.
This phenomenon leads to the inhibition of autophagy, contributing to Aβ clearance.
However, the chances of insulin desensitization need to be checked, which further interrupts Akt activation, as reported in the post-mortem AD brain
Insulin activation of mTORC1 triggers the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 pathway, which is upregulated in AD brain and cell models
During AD, Aβ aggregates worsened mTORC1 signaling due to 40 kDa proline-rich Akt substrate phosphorylation (PRAS40), leading to mTORC1 activity enhancement and autophagy inhibition
A study
Nevertheless, the mTORC1 upstream region is interlinked with other mechanisms like glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and AD pathology, thus complicating further studies
In the brains affected with AD, autophagy's function is altered, leading to the deposition of many toxic proteins.
There are many genes, factors, and mechanisms interlinked with the autophagy pathway, which include neuro-

Many autophagy inducers or mTOR inhibitors are used for AD treatment.
However, there are several autophagyinducing agents which require validation.
For instance, primary mTORC1 inhibitors termed rapalogs are effective in AD models, while secondary compounds like torins have not been verified.
The mTORC1 activity will be blocked by these molecules, like ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors
The alteration of cell signaling concerning the mTOR pathway may protect neurons and pose a new approach for neurodegenerative disorders.
Most molecules like calpeptin, minoxidil, and BH3 mimetics, which are autophagy-independent and mTOR-dependent, were not examined in AD models
Henceforward, the studies on the mechanism of autophagy induction by these molecules and the side effects are becoming more relevant for AD treatment

Drugs that can suppress/inhibit mTOR
AD has become a globally reported disease with 24 million victims, and the cases are expected to quadruple in due course over the years.
Despite the worldwide prevalence, only two types of drug molecules, namely N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists and cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors, have been approved for AD treatment.
Treatment strategies for AD include the use of symptomatic agents such as cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil and rivastigmine), disease-modifying therapeutics (e.g., aducanumab and gantenerumab), disease-modifying agents (e.g., lithium and riluzole), chaperone proteins (HSPs), vacuolar sorting protein 35 and several other extracts from natural products
Many drugs are designed with the function of activating autophagic flux and inhibiting mTOR signaling for AD diagnosis.
In recent years, many studies revealed that rapamycin has neuroprotective activity and can act as a pro-autophagy molecule in animal and cell models
The toxic nature of various amyloidogenic peptides responds to rapamycin treatment in neuron cell cultures
Similar positive results were observed in other animal models with parameters like aging, protein misfolding, neurotoxicity, and inheritance leading to neurodegeneration
Several studies on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)affected patients with lithium conveyed positive results in clinical trials
Autophagy, i.e., autophagic flux and its modulation, needs 1) complicated and multifaceted signaling, 2) integration coupling of environmental conditions, and 3) functional cell communications that include differentiation, proliferation, and cytoplasmic homeostasis
Rapamycin, a member of the macrolide class, and its analogs, generally known as rapalogs, are meant for the inhibition of mTOR signaling.
The said first-generation mTOR inhibitors like everolimus, rapamycin and temsirolimus bind to the 12-kDa FK506 binding protein (FKBP-12) outside the ATP binding pocket and inhibit the mTORC1 kinase activity, keeping mTORC2 unaltered
The drugs acting as autophagy activators can be a novel approach for neural protection by reducing the toxicity levels of misfolded proteins
In general, all neurodegenerative disorders show similar pathogenic mechanisms like autophagic flux impairment losing the ability to degrade the neurotoxic oligomers of wrongly folded proteins.
Nevertheless, the autophagy process can be pharmacologically activated by hindering the enzymatic activity of mTORC1.
Consequently, its autophagy suppressing activity, found in the physiological condition, is lost.
Similarly, rapamycin is the first drug that acts pharmacologically by enhancing autophagy inducing neuroprotection, and offering the clearance of oligomers.
This step necessitates disease-modifying strategies to trigger the development of new compounds and also the modification of existing drug molecules for better proautophagic potentiality.
The rapalogs and rapamycin act as autophagy inducers by stabilizing raptor-mTOR connectivity and inhibiting mTOR stimulation
Torin1 and dactolisib can also inhibit mTOR signaling.
Other compounds that activate AMPK signaling, like trehalose, metformin, and resveratrol, promote mTOR inactivation and are AMPK-dependent (Figure
Furthermore, compounds such as Apelins
4.2 Validation of the role of autophagy induction in Alzheimer's disease:

Concepts and queries
One of the key considerations in assessing the effect of autophagy induction on AD prevention is that the chemical molecules are nonspecific and, therefore, may affect other processes in the cell.
Henceforth, to verify and understand the effects and treatment modes of the molecules, the autophagy-inducing agent enhancing autophagy in AD must be demonstrated, on which the therapeutic effect of the said molecule relies on.
Table
Few other drugs/molecules were also claimed to induce autophagy, but they may trigger defective autophagy process by modifying the autophagosome formation, autophagosome maturation, and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway via faulty lysosomal acidification
Another critical challenge is whether the autophagy inducers virtually influence all AD types and whether it must be applied to populations based on the disease stage and the patient genetic history.
Overall, since the combined hypothesis on molecular mechanisms of neuron destruction in various neurodegenerative disorders includes autophagy pathway malfunction leading to oligomer aggregation, analysis of the utilization of pro-autophagic drugs will validate this role further, even in AD conditions.
Specifically, existing and novel compounds are under preclinical and clinical trials for the induction of autophagy through oligomer clearance.
Besides, many existing drugs will have off-target effects.
Hence, there remains the necessity for developing novel assays for detecting autophagic flux in clinical trials of animal and human models.

Conclusion
Despite the collection of huge data in the current review on the role of autophagy in AD treatment, the proper functioning of autophagy and the mechanical induction of autophagy by drug compounds is decisive for aging and neurons in a natural way.
The defect in the autophagic mechanism of neurons is one of the projecting factors that generate neurodegenerative disorders like AD.
Although its therapeutic effect requires further validation studies, and since autophagy is mainly affected in AD, autophagy remains a primary innovation as a new therapeutic target in the form of autophagy inducers.
The Aβ and tau protein metabolism pathways, mTOR signaling, and autophagy's role are significant, including mediating effects in neuro-inflammation and endo-cannabinoid systems, and are tremendously influenced by the autophagy process acting as intermediating agents during AD conditions.
Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting the autophagy mechanism would pave the way for expanding novel strategies for AD management.
The new approaches should include therapeutics that inhibit mTOR signaling and induce autophagy without altering the other interconnected mechanisms.
