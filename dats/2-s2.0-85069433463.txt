Down-Regulation of Essential Synaptic Components by GI-Tract Microbiome-Derived Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in LPS-Treated Human Neuronal-Glial (HNG) Cells in Primary Culture: Relevance to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
LPS, Synaptic Proteins and Alzheimer's Disease BF-LPS express their neurotoxicity in the CNS in part through the directed downregulation of neuron-specific neurofilaments and synaptic signaling proteins; and (ii) that this may explain the significant alterations in immune-responses and cognitive deficits observed after bacterial-derived LPS exposure to the human CNS.
Trans-synaptic neurotransmission of both electrical and neurochemical information in the central nervous system (CNS) is achieved through a highly interactive network of neuron-specific synaptic proteins that include pre-synaptic and post-synaptic elements.
These elements include a family of several well-characterized integral-and transmembrane synaptic core proteins necessary for the efficient operation of this complex signaling network, and include the pre-synaptic proteins: (i) neurexin-1 (NRXN-1); (ii) the synaptosomal-associated phosphoprotein-25 (SNAP-25); (iii) the phosphoprotein synapsin-2 (SYN-2); and the post-synaptic elements: (iv) neuroligin (NLGN), a critical cell adhesion protein; and (v) the SH3-ankyrin repeat domain, proline-rich cytoskeletal scaffolding protein SHANK3.
All five of these pre-and post-synaptic proteins have been found to be significantly down-regulated in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) cell cocultures after exposure to Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide (BF-LPS).
Interestingly, LPS has also been reported to be abundant in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain cells where there are significant deficits in this same family of synaptic components.
This "Perspectives" paper will review current research progress and discuss the latest findings in this research area.
Overall these experimental results provide evidence (i) that gastrointestinal (GI) tract-derived Gram-negative bacterial exudates such as
The Human GI-Tract Microbiome and Gram-Negative Anaerobic Bacillus

Bacteroides fragilis
Emerging evidence continues to suggest a contribution of the gastrointestinal (GI)-tract microbiome to human neurological health and disease
The GI-tract of Homo sapiens contains a complex microbiome consisting primarily of bacteria, with archaea, fungi, microbial eukaryotes, protozoa, viruses, and other microorganisms making up the balance
Together with human host cells the microbiome comprises the entire metaorganism whose host interactions and symbiotic associations are significantly implicated in the biochemistry and neurochemistry of human health and disease
Microbiome-linked diseases include lethal, progressive, agerelated, inflammatory neurodegenerative and synaptic disorders of the human CNS such as AD
Interestingly, of the 52 currently recognized bacterial phyla, H. sapiens have co-evolved with just two dominant divisions: Bacteroidetes, representing ∼20-30% of all human GI-tract resident bacteria, and Firmicutes (about 70-80%), with Actinobacteria (∼3%), Proteobacteria (∼1%), and Verrucomicrobia (∼0.1%) making up the remaining divisions.
These five major bacterial phyla represent the "microbial-core" of the human GI-tract microbiome
The vast majority of all human GI-tract microbiota consists of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and Bacteroidetes species represent the most abundant Gram-negative anaerobic genus, outnumbering Escherichia coli in abundance by about one-hundred-to-one
Interestingly, certain Bacteroidetes species such as Bacteroides fragilis (B.
fragilis), as a normal commensal microbe of the human GI-tract, are thought to be usually advantageous to human health due to their abilities to biosynthesize and/or metabolize dietary fiber, complex sugars and polysaccharides, volatile fatty acids, and other nutrients, to function in the development, maintenance, and homeostasis of the host immune and digestive systems
However, when enterotoxigenic strains of Bacteroidetes species including B. fragilis proliferate and their formidable array of secreted neurotoxins, including the classic neuro-inflammatory pattern recognition molecule LPS, leak through normally protective mucosal barriers of the GItract and blood-brain barrier (BBB) they can cause substantial inflammatory pathology both systemically and within vulnerable CNS compartments

BF-LPS, NEUROINFLAMMATION AND SYNAPTIC DISTURBANCES
The lipopolysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis (BF-LPS) is one of the most neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory lipoglycans known
The pathogenic actions, pro-inflammatory mechanisms and neurodegeneration-promoting activities, however, of these secreted Gram-negative exotoxins on developing, adult or aging synaptic structure and function remain incompletely understood but currently significant progress is being made
LPSinduced cognitive impairments appear to be, in part, the result of attenuated neocortical and/or hippocampal microglial activation, cytokine and reactive oxidative species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress damage, disruption of the BBB, the ROSmediated oxidative destruction and loss of synaptic plasticity related proteins, up-regulated neuroinflammatory signaling or any combination of these

EFFECTS OF LPS IN EXPERIMENTAL MODELS OF CNS INJURY AND NEURODEGENERATION
The intraperitoneal injection of LPS in experimental brain injury models elicits a rapid innate-immune-response and systemic inflammatory reaction with accompanying cognitive deficits
Interestingly both LPS-treated and chronically sleep-restricted mice exhibit higher brain expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and significant reductions in the levels of pre-and post-synaptic marker proteins
Hippocampal neurons from newborns are highly susceptible to LPS-induced brain inflammation affecting microglial-mediated synaptogenesis with disproportionate alterations in synaptic adhesion molecules and synaptic scaffolding proteins, and accompanying deficits in cognition
Systemic inflammation as the result of LPS injection in neonatal mouse models or the use of the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD has been further shown to increase the permeability of the BBB
Prenatal exposure to LPS also results in cognitive deficits in offspring rodents as they age
LPS also induces a progressive neuro-inflammation, apoptosis, synaptic dysfunction cognitive impairment in aging murine models of neurodegeneration
Taken together these data indicate that LPSmediated deficits in multiple synaptic components, LPS-induced synaptic dysfunction and altered synaptogenesis may be the common factor linking a progressive or developmental synaptic disorganization that is temporally associated with cognitive failure and/or age-related cognitive decline.

HNG CELLS -DNA ARRAY AND ELISA-BASED ASSAY OF β-ACTIN, NF-L AND SYNAPTIC GENE EXPRESSION
The culture and growth of human neuronal-glial (HNG) cells and preparation of LPS-enriched extracts from different Gram negative bacterial sources has been previously described in detail by our laboratory
The commercial source of HNG cells (Lonza, Houston TX, United States; Catalog #: PT-2599; see Figures
The analysis, verification and quantitation of the control β-actin filament, the down-regulated neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain intermediate filament protein and this family of five pre-and post-synaptic messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins described here were based on: (i) micro-fluidic DNA array analytical technologies for mRNA abundance, speciation and complexity (Figure
Both of these methodologies have been extensively described and developed by our laboratory over the last 21 years

β-ACTIN, NF-L AND SYNAPSE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS: THEIR INTEGRATED FUNCTIONS AND METHODS OF DETECTION
β-actin (also known as ACTB; encoded at human chr 7p22.1) is a highly conserved 42 kDa polypeptide that polymerizes to produce microfilaments that form cross-linked networks in the cellular cytoplasm; interestingly β-actin is the most abundant 6 nm diameter microfilament in the synapse; β-actin proteins and filaments were detected using a ACTB/β-actin ELISA Kit; catalog number LS-F10737 (LifeSpan BioSciences, Seattle WA) with a detection range of 0.312-20 ng/ml.
The neurofilament-light (NF-L) chain protein (also known as NEFL, NF68, NFL; encoded at human chr 8p21.2) is a 68 kDa polypeptide that forms a 10 nm diameter type IV intermediate filament specific to the neuronal cytoplasm; ∼20 um; LPS attraction for neuronal nuclei may be in part glial-cell modulated; there is recent evidence that perinuclear LPS may disrupt the normal transcriptional output of human neuronal nuclei for neuron-specific components such as the neurofilament light chain (NF-L) protein
together with microfilaments and microtubules NF-L forms the neuronal cytoskeleton and regulates axonal caliber and axonal conduction velocity; NF-L has long been known to exhibit significantly reduced expression in AD brain
Neurexin-1 (NRXN; encoded at chr 2p16.3), is a large 162 kDa single-pass type I membrane protein that serves as a cell-surface receptor and binds neuroligins to form Ca 2+ -dependent neurexin/neuroligin (NRXN/NLGN) complexes at CNS synapses; these are required for efficient neurotransmission and are involved in the formation of stable synaptic contacts; NRXN-1 was detected using a NRXN1 ELISA kit; Catalog Number ABIN2870172 (LifeSpan BioSciences); with a detection range of 0.312-20 ng/ml).
The synaptosome associated protein 25 (SNAP25; encoded at human chr 20p12.2) is a 25 kDa synaptic vesicle membrane docking and fusion protein whose actions are mediated by SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) located on the synaptic vesicle membrane (v-SNAREs) and/or the target membrane (t-SNAREs); SNAP25 is a presynaptic plasma membrane protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release; SNAP25 proteins were detected using a SNAP25 ELISA kit; Catalog Number LS-F17747-1 (LifeSpan BioSciences); with a detection range of 0.78-50 ng/ml.
Synapsin-2 (SYN-2; encoded at chr 3p25.2) is a ∼54 kDa member of the synapsin gene family, encoding a neuronal phosphoprotein that associates with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles; SYN-2 is implicated in synaptogenesis and the impairment of neurotransmitter release in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases
The type 1 cell surface-cell adhesion protein neuroligin (NLGN; encoded at human chr 3q26.31) is a 94 kDa type 1 integral membrane protein of the type-B carboxylesterase/lipase family; NLGN is located on the post-synaptic membrane and acts as a ligand for β-neurexins (which are cell adhesion proteins located presynaptically); NLGNs affect the properties of neural networks by specifying synaptic functions and mediating synaptic signaling by recruiting and stabilizing key synaptic components; NLGN also plays a role in synapse function and synaptic signal transmission and mediates its signaling effects by recruiting and clustering other synaptic proteins, by promoting the initial formation of synapses and by triggering the de novo formation of pre-synaptic structures may be involved in the specification of excitatory synapses; synaptic adhesion molecules such as NLGN have an essential role in synaptic development
The SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domain three post-synaptic protein SHANK3 (encoded at human chr 22q13.3) is a very large ∼186 kDa proline-rich post-synaptic cytoskeletal scaffolding protein that functions as an adapter protein at the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses that interconnects receptors of the post-synaptic membrane; these include NMDAtype and metabotropic glutamate receptors via complexes with GKAP/PSD-95 and Homer, respectively, and the β-actin-based micro-cytoskeleton; SHANK3 also plays a critical role in the structural and functional organization of the dendritic spine and synaptic junction and as such are key players in the modulation of trans-synaptic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity

Taken together the results suggest an LPS-directed down-regulation of critical neuron-specific cytoskeletal and synaptic components in HNG co-cultures and this may explain, in part, the significant alterations and deficits in immune responses and cognition observed after bacterial-sourced LPS exposure to the human CNS.

DOWN-REGULATION OF NF-L AND PRE-AND POST-SYNAPTIC PROTEINS IN LPS-TREATED HNG CELLS
The neuron-specific NF-L intermediate filament protein, the pre-synaptic proteins NRXN-1, SNAP-25, SYN-2, and the postsynaptic proteins NLGN and SHANK3 constitute a critical mass of axonal filament support elements and synaptic signaling proteins whose deficits might be expected to lead to the inability of neurons and synapses to carry out both electrical-and neurochemical-based neurotransmission in the CNS, and hence contribute to deficits in cognition and memory formation in AD and in neurodegenerative disease models
Why the expression of genes and proteins involved in the structure and function of the synapse appears to be targeted by the intensely pro-inflammatory LPS may be explained in part by the following multiple and highly interactive and dynamic factors:
(i) specific LPS-induced destabilizing effects on celladhesion proteins and vascular endothelial cells
(ii) LPS-mediated generation of ROS and the induction of significant amounts of oxidative stress which directly impacts the abundance and integrity of synapses, synaptogenesis and cognition in murine and related rodent models of neurodegeneration
(v) run-on transcription studies using HNG cells in primary culture employing an extremely sensitive endogenous RNA polymerase II activity driven incorporation of [α-32 P]-uridine triphosphate (10 8 dpm/ml) into newly synthesized total RNA indicates that LPS at nanomolar concentrations strongly inhibits the transcriptional output of neuronal nuclei; this may contribute in part to the generalized down-regulation of gene expression for transcription factors and synaptic and neurotrophic markers as is widely observed in sporadic AD

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY
The primary evidence of a potentially pathogenic link between microbial-derived neurotoxins of the human GItract microbiome, such as Gram-negative B. fragilis-derived LPS, and the contribution of LPS to the pathogenetic mechanisms of sporadic AD came over 6 years ago
More recent evidence continues to strengthen our hypothesis that GI-tractsourced, microbial-derived neurotoxins -now known to include Gram-negative bacterial-derived LPS, endotoxins and exotoxins (such as fragilysin), bacterial amyloids and bacterial-sourced small non-coding RNA (sncRNA)have substantial potential to cross the aging and/or the diseased GI-tract and the BBB to gain access to CNS compartments, the parenchyma of brain cells and the neuronal cytoplasm to contribute to progressive pro-inflammatory neurodegeneration, altered synaptic organization and progressive loss of synaptic function.
Activated microglial cells, astrocytes, and other types of glial cells appear to modulate many of these pathological activities of LPS, including LPS effects on neuronal nuclei
LPSmediated synaptic alterations now appear to range from defective synaptogenesis during CNS development to increasingly altered cognitive abilities in AD and related neurological disorders which exhibit progressive inflammatory neurodegeneration
In summary, these combined results provide the first evidence that strongly pro-inflammatory, GI-tract microbiomederived LPS induces both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic changes via the down-regulation of critical and specific synaptic components in primary HNG cell co-cultures, many of which are also observed in AD brain.
The findings further support our idea that cytoskeletal-associated and synaptic molecules known to play essential roles in transsynaptic communication: (i) are targeted by LPS and drive inflammatory neurodegenerative disease; and (ii) create specific alterations in neuronal synaptic transmission, and by doing so contribute to cognitive deficiencies characteristic of AD and the neurodegenerative disease process.
