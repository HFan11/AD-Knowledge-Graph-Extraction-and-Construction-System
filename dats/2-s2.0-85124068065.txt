A Perspective on Nrf2 Signaling Pathway for Neuroinflammation: A Potential Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases
Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the leading causes of dementia.
These neurological disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-ß (Aß), tau protein and α-synuclein, contributing to mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.
Misfolded proteins activate microglia, which induces neuroinflammation, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequently facilitates synaptic damage and neuronal loss.
So far, all the proposed drugs were based on the inhibition of protein aggregation and were failed in clinical trials.
Therefore, the treatment options of dementia are still a challenging issue.
Thus, it is worthwhile to study alternative therapeutic strategies.
In this context, there is increasing data on the pivotal role of transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) on the redox homeostasis and anti-inflammatory functions in neurodegenerative disorders.
Interestingly, Nrf2 signaling pathway has shown upregulation of antioxidant genes, inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammation, and improved mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting Nrf2 activation could be a novel therapeutic approach to target pathogenesis.
The present review will examine the correlation between Nrf2 signaling with neuroinflammation in AD and PD.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroinflammation is a crucial hallmark in the progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Friedrich's ataxia, and stroke
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurological disorder is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal aggregation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) accumulation leading to the neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and a gradual loss in cholinergic, synaptic and cognitive functions
Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurological disorder, is characterized by progressive degeneration and death of dopaminergic neurons and the characteristic feature is the formation of fibrillar aggregates into intraneuronal inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LBs) which constitute more than 70% of a-synuclein
Protein misfolding, mitochondrial damages, oxidative stress and inflammation are the primary risk factors in AD and PD.
A common feature of all neurodegenerative diseases is immense oxidative stress leading to the dysfunction of neuronal cells.
Oxidative stress is a biological condition driven by the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cellular antioxidant defense response.
Oxidative stress cause membrane lipid oxidation, ROS attack cellular membranes leading to functional and/or structural impairment of the membranes and to the formation of toxic lipid products as 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE), malondialdehyde, acrolein, and F2-isoprostanes.
In respect of their oxidative-induced damage properties, these compounds are considered as disease mediators and due to their more stable forms their measure render quantifiable the magnitude of oxidative stress in biological samples
Indeed, the brain tissue in AD and PD and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients showed high levels of HNE
Similarly, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs), acrolein, and F2-isoprostanes are all found to be elevated in AD
As an endogenous defense mechanism, the activity of the antioxidant proteins such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase are significantly up-regulated in the hippocampus and amygdala of AD brains
Furthermore, Aβ42 binds copper (I) ions forming Aβ42-Cu + complex which could reduce oxygen to generate H 2 O 2 and free radicals
It is well established that the development and progression of PD involved oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and also neuroinflammation
In vivo and in vitro studies have shown disruption of mitochondrial function in the dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra in early stages of PD
Moreover, increased mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with impaired Complex I and consequently increased oxidative stress was observed in later stages of PD patients,
In PD, α-synuclein has a mitochondrial targeted aminoterminal sequence which is responsible for the interactions with the inner mitochondrial membrane and disruption of complex I function, thereby triggers oxidative stress
Moreover, the parkin protein, which is constitutively expressed in normal mitochondria, reportedly found to be inhibited with impaired complex I activity in oxidative stress conditions
In addition, DJ-1, a protein with antioxidant properties, is a well-known oxidative stress sensor as excess oxidation of DJ-1, renders this protein inactive.
The oxidized form of DJ-1 protein has been observed in patients with sporadic PD and AD, suggesting the role of DJ-1 in the onset and pathogenesis of sporadic PD as well as familial PD
In response to oxidative stress, nuclear factor (erythroidderived 2)-like2 (Nrf2) plays a crucial role by inducing expression of a wide range of cytoprotective genes.
Overexpression of DJ-1 has been reported to increase the Nrf2 protein levels and enhances its antioxidant role to improve the phase II response
Nrf2 plays a crucial role in regulation of cellular redox homeostasis and neuroinflammation.
Accumulating evidences indicated the expression of Nrf2 in neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells
Interestingly, Nrf2 expression is found to be higher in astrocytes than in neurons and activation of Nrf2 triggers Nrf2 target genes in astrocytes
Furthermore, astrocytes overexpressing Nrf2 protects neurons from oxidative stress

NRF2-KEAP1 SIGNALING PATHWAY
Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), is a member of the Cap'n'collar (CNC) transcription factor family and involved in redox signaling, xenobiotic metabolism
Nrf2 protein consists of 605 amino acids and is divided into seven highly conserved functional domains, namely Neh1-Neh7 (Figure
The Neh1 domain has a cap "n" collar basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is responsible for DNAbinding
The Neh3, Neh4, and Neh5 are transactivation domains which regulates the binding of Nrf2 with other coactivators
The Neh6 domain acts as a negative regulatory domain and binds with a β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) for Nrf2 ubiquitination
The Neh7 domain is involved in the direct binding to the retinoic X receptor α (RXRα), a repressor of NRF2, thus contributing to the inhibition of Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway
On the other hand, the Neh2 domain constitutes an Nterminal regulatory domain and regulates the stability of Nrf2 by influencing binding with different proteins.
Neh2 domain consists of seven lysine residues which are responsible for ubiquitin conjugation.
In addition, it also consists of two peptidebinding motifs (DLG and ETGE), which interact with Keap1 and is responsible for Nrf2 ubiquitination and its proteasomal degradation under normal physiological conditions
Keap1, the main intracellular regulator of Nrf2, is a cysteinerich protein, which is divided into five domains (Figure
Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered by cytoplasmic Keap1 and targeted to proteasomal degradation
During homeostasis, the BTB domain regulates Keap1 homodimerization and its binding to the cullin-based (Cul3) E3 ligase, forming Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 (Ring box protein-1) (Figure
During oxidative stress conditions, the DLG motif dissociates from Keap1 protein leading to a disruption in the alignment of Nrf2 lysine residues that prevents its ubiquitination and consequently, Nrf2 is released from Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex, translocate into the nucleus and heterodimerizes with one of the sMaf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog) proteins
This activates the transcription of a cascade of genes containing an antioxidant response element (ARE) within their promoter region
However, the binding of DGR domain to Nrf2 is competitively inhibited by proteins with specific motifs, such as p62 and localizer of BRCA2
A non-canonical pathway for activation of Nrf2 involves competitive inhibition of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction via p62/Sqstm1
In case of p62-Keap1-Nrf2 axis, p62 acts as a modulator of Nrf2 activation.
The Keap1-interacting region (KIR) of p62 interacts with Keap1, preventing Keap1 from trapping Nrf2, which leads to the Nrf2 stabilization following its activation
The KIR region of p62 consists of serine 349, which is phosphorylated during oxidative stress conditions.
The phosphorylated p62 in turn has a higher affinity for Keap1
Another model, Nrf2-EpRE pathway regulation via nicotinic receptors postulates that in oxidative stress conditions, after receptor activation, post-translational modifications occurs in Nrf2 which stimulates nuclear translocation and binding of Nrf2 with the EpRE sequences
Interestingly, this model represents a correlation between anti-inflammatory pathway and the Nrf2-dependent phase II antioxidant regulation
The phosphorylation of Nrf2 by different kinases has been reported to affect the Nrf2 translocation.
Phosphorylation of Ser40 residue of Nrf2 by atypical PKC iota (aPKCι) releases Nrf2 from Keap1
Similarly, other kinases such as casein kinase-2 (CK2)
Several kinases are constitutively activated or over-expressed in chronic inflammation or oxidative stress conditions.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3β) can phosphorylate Nrf2 leading to the recognition of Nrf2 by an E3 ligase receptor and the Fbox protein β-TrCP followed by its degradation in a Keap1independent manner
It has been shown that the Neh6 domain of Nrf2 consists of two motifs, the activity of one of which, DSGIS, is significantly up-regulated by GSK3β activity
On the other hand, accumulating evidences also indicated that, GSK3β activation could phosphorylate Fyn, which in turn regulates Nrf2 via phosphorylation, nuclear export and proteasomal degradation during pathological conditions
Another kinase, MAPK p38 reportedly stabilizes the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 thereby induces the Nrf2 breakdown

ROLE OF NRF2 IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
AD affects more than 50 million people, and medical management is still a challenge as its pathogenesis still needs to be explored
The pathogenesis in AD is related to the aggregation of Aß plaques and hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau resulting in neurofibrillary FIGURE 2 | The regulatory mechanism of Nrf2 in AD.
Under oxidative stress (electrophiles or ROS conditions) Nrf2 is released from Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex for translocation into the nucleus followed by its heterodimerization with sMaf which leads to its binding with the antioxidant response elements (AREs), and transcription of ARE-driven genes.
Nrf2 activation may increase the levels of p62 which is responsible for the autophagic process and inhibit the BACE1 that generate amyloid-β peptides in the neurons.
Moreover, Nrf2 counteracts neurofibrillary, tau proteins tangle and amyloid-β plaques.
tangles (NFTs).
The AßPP processing by proteases leads to the generation of Aß, which is then transferred from the brain to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is engulfed by microglia by phagocytosis
On the other hand, hyperphosphorylated tau protein forms oligomeric paired helical fragments (PHFs), leading to intracellular NFTs, forming abnormal aggregates.
The level of Nrf2 is reportedly decrease as a function of age
Accumulating evidences also suggested a significant negative correlation between Nrf2 deficits and AD
Also, Nrf2 directly and indirectly influences changes in autophagy in vivo and in vitro
Some other reports have shown the cognitive deficits in AD animal models and aggravates AD-like pathology via Nrf2 ablation
Furthermore, activation of Nrf2 by genetic and pharmaceutical inteventions leads to a neuroprotective role in AD patients
Nrf2 target genes such as NADPH quinone oxidoreductase I (NQO1), Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) expressions were observed in AD brains
Nrf2-regulated target genes, NQO1 and NQO2, are two cytosolic flavoproteins responsible for the catalysis of two-electron mediated reduction of quinones to hydroquinones
NQO1 maintains the reduced form of CoQ9 and CoQ10 inside the lipid vesicles and thus protects the plasma membrane from membrane lipid peroxidation and free radicals.
A number of evidence suggest a NQO1 role in development and progression of AD
In this respect, it was reported that NQO1 enzyme activity is up-regulated in the brain areas involved in AD pathology such as frontal cortex
Another recent study showed the elevation in NQO1 expression in 3xTg-AD mice preceded any intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity suggesting that up-regulation of NQO1 in AD pathology
In contrast, in another study performed in AD human and mouse models, it has been demonstrated that Nrf2 activation was not able to regulate some of its target genes thus determining repressed expression of antioxidant defenses
This discordance could depend on the stage of disease.
In fact, during the initial phases of AD, Nrf2-dependent gene expression is up-regulated due to the initial defensive cellular mechanism against ROS, however in the latter stages, as oxidative stress increases, Nrf2-dependent gene expression was shown to either reduced or remains stationary
The protective role of Nrf2 in AD is supported by results derived from Nrf2-deficient mice.
In fact, Nrf2 -/-mice crossed with mutant APP/PS1 mice leads to the increase in Aβ and AβPP intracellular levels compared to mutant AβPP/PS1 mice
A significant increase was also observed in the insoluble p-tau and Aβ levels in Nrf2-deficient mice was observed
It was shown that the lack of Nrf2 significantly worsens cognitive deficits in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD
Impaired proteostasis is a crucial hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases
Macroautophagy is one of the main mechanisms that ensure timely degradation of misfolded, oxidized or altered proteins that otherwise develop proteinopathy
A functional connection between Nrf2 and macroautophagy gene expression was shown in a mouse model of AD that reproduces impaired APP (amyloid β precursor protein) and human (Hs)MAPT/Tau processing, clearance and aggregation
Nrf2-regulated autophagy marker SQSTM1/p62 was observed to be reduced in the absence of Nrf2
Other reports stated that Nrf2 has an impact on chaperone-mediated autophagy
Nrf2 binding sequences were identified in the LAMP2 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A) gene in several human and mouse cell types and Nrf2 deficiency and overexpression was found to be correlated with reduced and increased LAMP2A levels, respectively
Nrf2 deletion in APP/PS1 mice reportedly enhanced inflammatory response and increase in intracellular APP, Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels.
Mechanistically, neurons from Nrf2-deficient APP/PS1 mice shows enhanced accumulation of endosomes, lysosomes, and multivesicular bodies
These findings indicated Nrf2-dependent processing and accumulation of APP/Aβ, and autophagic dysfunction.
In agreement with these findings, in vivo Nrf2 activation in response to the ADinitiating Aβ42 peptide, was shown to prevent neuronal toxicity
Another study in the AD animal model reported the reduction in Aβ42 level and p-tau after treatment with Nrf2 activator, isoastilbin
Accordingly, further analysis revealed that Nrf2 inhibits the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression by binding to the AREs in the promoter of BACE1 in AD animal models.
This further inhibits Aβ production, and ameliorates cognitive deficits, however, Nrf2-dependent regulation of BACE1 is independent of ROS repression
BACE1 is a beta secretase that generate amyloid-β peptides in the neurons.
Importantly, Nrf2 could reduce the levels of p-tau in AD by inducing nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52) by binding to the AREs in the promoter of NDP52
NDP52, is an autophagy-associated protein which facilitates autophagy-mediated degradation of p-tau
Consistent with this, another study reported the Nrf2-dependent modulation of selective autophagy processes which facilitates the clearance of tau species
The downregulation in the expression of BAG3, NBR1, NDP52, and p62 genes were observed in aged Nrf2 -/-animals compared to those in young Nrf2 -/-animals, suggesting the role of Nrf2 in gene expressions during aging
In the hippocampus of mice expressing human TAUP301L protein and AD patients with tauopathy, the TAU-injured neurons release the chemokine fractalkine CX3CL1 and an increase in the Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins levels
The plasma and CSF levels of soluble CX3CL1 was reportedly found to be elevated in cognitive impairment and AD
The interconnection between CX3CL1 and NRF2 in the modulation of neuroinflammation was elucidated by Lastres-Becker et al. (
The authors showed that CX3CL1 stimulation increases the NRF2-ARE gene expression by activating AKT (phospho-AKTSer473), leading to the inhibition of GSK3B by phosphorylation of Ser9 (phospho-GSK-3βSer9). On the contrary, by using primary microglia from mouse strains that lack either NRF2 (Nrf2 -/-) or CX3CR1 (Cx3cr1 -/-) in vitro stimulation with CX3CL1 failed to induce the HO-1 expression.
Of note, both knockout mice showed microgliosis and astrogliosis in case of neuronal TAUP301L expression, suggesting the CXCL1/NRF2/HO-1-dependent mitigation of the pro-inflammatory phenotype.
Moreover, inhibition of GSK3β correlated with a stability in the Nrf2 levels, indicating that inhibition of GSK3β prevents Nrf2 degradation bypassing the KEAP1.
Indeed, GSK3β activity in the Neh6 domain of NRF2 creates a degradation domain that is then recognized by β-TrCP
Therefore, the lack of CX3CR1/PI3K/AKT signaling results in the non-phosphorylated active conformation of GSK3β which in turn leads to the Nrf2 downregulation via GSK3β/β-TrCP pathway.
A summary of the regulatory mechanism of Nrf2 in AD is reported in Figure

ROLE OF NRF2 IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is another common neurodegenerative disorder affecting 1-4% of people above 65
The pathological feature of PD includes the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and intraneuronal accumulations of a-synuclein into Lewy body inclusions (Figure
PD patients show resting tremor, postural instability, gait imbalance, bradykinesia, and dementia in some cases as the most characteristic symptoms
Microglia, a cell type of the monocytemacrophage linage, is mainly responsible for inflammation in the brain.
PD is observed to be associated with the up-regulation of the free radical generating enzymes and the accumulation of CA-MO microglia
The Nrf2 activity was found to be significantly reduced in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD, and loss of Nrf2 further exacerbated the phenotype
Mice and monkeys when treated with MPTP showed astroglial HO-1 expression in striatum and elevated iron deposition
In support of these, several studies have demonstrated increased markers of oxidative damage along with decreased levels of antioxidants in the blood and CSF of PD patients, which was found to be linked with Nrf2 pathway
Expression of Nrf2 was strongly nuclear in PD nigral neurons, whereas it is cytoplasmic in normal conditions
Furthermore, Nrf2 signature, represented by NQO1 and HO-1 expressions are up-regulated, suggesting Nrf2-dependent brain protection
Another report showed the sequestering of NQO1 and p62 protein expressions in Lewy bodies in postmortem samples of PD patients, suggesting Nrf2-dependent neuroprotection
Similarly, in a PD Drosophila model, Nrf2 overexpression and Keap1 knockdown attenuated the reduced locomotor activity and dopaminergic neuron degeneration
Activated microglia play a key role in neuroinflammation by release of cytokines.
Microglia are resident innate immune cells of the brain that act as macrophages, which ranges from pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to immunosuppressive M2 phenotype.
Activated microglia encompasses multiple functions: clearance of accumulated or deteriorated neuronal and tissue elements, dynamic interaction with neurons whilst regulating the synaptic pruning process, and maintaining overall brain homeostasis as well as maintenance of chronic inflammation
A significant increase was observed in proinflammatory cytokines in the experimental models and cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients
In vivo findings confirmed that widespread microglial activation is associated with the pathological process in PD thus supporting the hypothesis that inflammation is a significant component of progressive dopaminergic degeneration via cytokine release
Evidence for a role of NRF2 in the modulation of microglial dynamics between pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes was reported by Cuadrado's group
In Nrf2-knockout mice with MPTP treatment, basal ganglia show a more severe dopaminergic dysfunction than wild type.
Nrf2-deficient mice exhibited intense astrogliosis and microgliosis indicated by an increase in expressions of GFAP and F4/80, respectively.
These changes were also associated with an increase in the levels of COX-2, iNOS, IL-6, and TNF-α with a significant decrease in anti-inflammatory markers such as FIZZ-1, YM-1, Arginase-1, and IL-4.
These results were further confirmed in microglial cultures stimulated with apoptotic conditioned medium from MPP1-treated dopaminergic cells.
These findings indicated a role of Nrf2 in tuning microglial activation in PD progression
Multiple studies investigated expression profiles at cellular levels and reports showed selective expression of Nrf2 in astrocytes as compared with neurons
Additionally, it has also been shown that astrocyte specific Nrf2 pathway activation confers protection to vulnerable neurons
Using a cell model derived from biopsies of the olfactory mucosa termed, human olfactory neurosphere-derived cells (hONS), it has been observed that a significant alteration of "Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response pathway" was associated to reduced levels of glutathione and salt, a measure of cellular metabolic activity based on reduction by NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes in PD patient-derived hONS cell lines when compared with control-donor derived cells
Another study, reported that knocking down Nrf2 with siRNA in control-donor derived hONS cells leads to the cellular phenotypes seen in PD cell lines
In this hONS model, Nrf2 pathway activation by treatment with L-Sulforaphane, restored disease-specific deficits in cellular functions (glutathione content and MTS metabolism)
Reports showed the up-regulation in Nrf2 expression in the hippocampal cells of AD brain tissue
DJ-1 (gene; PARK7) a recessively inherited Parkinson's gene, prevents oxidative stress in a Nrf2-dependent manner by preventing Keap1mediated ubiquitination
In addition to this, a short, cell penetrating, peptide derivative of DJ-1 prevents H 2 O 2 , 6-OHDA, and DA-induced oxidative stress in Nrf2-dependent pathway in neuroblastoma cell lines
Furthermore, mutant isoforms, knockdown, and knockout models of DJ-1 have shown to prevent the expression of the Nrf2-mediated redox signaling molecules, thioredoxin 1
Therefore, a strong relationship between Nrf2 and PD is well established till date and it has been proposed that intervening oxidative stress through the Nrf2-dependent pathway could be useful in the treatment of PD.
Another line of evidence revealed the key role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt kinases in the activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response
The regulation of neuroprotection in PD involving PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling axis is supported by the fact that Akt activity declines with age, which is the main risk factor for sporadic PD
Additionally, an association between PD and single nucleotide polymorphism has been reported in the GSK3B gene leading to the elevation of GSK3β expression and activity
Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3β enhanced Nrf2 activity and increased expression of Phase II antioxidant genes, thereby protecting against oxidants such as H 2 O 2 , 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and MPP +
A summary of the regulatory mechanism of Nrf2 in PD is reported in Figure

CROSS-TALK BETWEEN NRF2 AND NEUROINFLAMMATION IN AD AND PD
It is assumed that Nrf2 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathways cooperate for the maintenance of the physiological tissue homeostasis and for the regulation of the cellular response to stress and inflammation.
Several pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated by NF-κB, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), have been shown to be enhanced in Nrf2-deficient mice in neuroinflammation as compared with wild-type mice, indicating that Nrf2 silencing promotes NF-κB -mediated inflammation
Since a bidirectional connection occurs between the brain and the peripheral immune system, therefore, Nrf2 plays a crucial role in neuroinflammation
In neurodegenerative disorders, microglial cells become activated, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)
To circumvent the damaging effect of oxidative stress and inflammation, cells have developed several defense mechanisms.
Nrf2/ARE signaling influences antiinflammatory changes in many kinds of brain injuries, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, ischemia and neurodegenerative disease
The Nrf2 activation pathway promotes the expression of antioxidative response elements, whereas nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a protein complex which influences cytokine production and cell survival, also promotes cellular responses to neuronal injury and synaptic plasticity
Aging per se is associated with Nrf2 dysfunction and continuous, low-grade inflammation.
These processes further contribute to neurodegeneration.
So far, results have shown that neuroinflammation has a vital role in the progression and development of AD and PD and the imbalance between Nrf2 and Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) could contribute to their pathogenesis of neuroinflammation.
Considerable evidence has revealed oxidative stress as well as chronic inflammation and autophagy in the brain correlated with the slow deterioration of AD
In addition, experimental data so far suggest that all these changes are associated with impaired Nrf2 activity
The impaired spatial learning and memory abilities of mice and the accumulation of Aβ and p-tauS404 in the hippocampus were observed to be aggravated in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1 transgenic (AT) mice with genetic removal of Nrf2
Furthermore, astroglial and microglial activation was exacerbated along with upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
Since, inflammation is implicated as the key mechanism that actively contributes to neurodegeneration, by influencing the responses of microglia and astrocytes.
Nrf2 is the key regulator for the two important cytoprotective pathways, anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation.
Nrf2, which is essential for protection against oxidative/xenobiotic stresses, has been shown to block transcriptional upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β in myeloid cells by binding to the proximity of proinflammatory genes that guide the macrophage activation toward the M1 proinflammatory phenotype
Treatment of neural stem/progenitor cells with Aβ induced reduction of neuronal differentiation which was prevented by Nrf2 over-expression, while Nrf2 deficiency enhanced impairment of neuronal differentiation
In the same study, the Aβ40 treatment had no direct effect on neurosphere proliferation, however, when associated with Nrf2 overexpression it led to an enhanced proliferation of neurospheres and Nrf2 deficiency reduced neurospheres proliferation.
Knockout of Nrf2 in mice crossed with AT or mutant HsAPPV717I/HsMAPTP301L mice showed exacerbated astrocyte and microglial activation
However, treatment with the kavalactone methysticin, an Nrf2 activator, significantly reduced microglial infiltration, astrogliosis, and the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A in APP/Psen1 mice
Furthermore, Nrf2 deletion exacerbated the inflammatory response in AT mice as shown by increased proinflammatory factors and hippocampal astrogliosis and activation of microglia surrounding the Aβ plaque, and NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles) in AD animal models or human patients
Indeed, hyperphosphorylated tau protein and fibrillar Aβ lead to inflammatory processes and the release of IL-1β in vivo and in vitro
Other reports showed that Aβ accumulation induced progressive impairment in microglial cells in their ability to phagocytize Aβ
However, Nrf2 absence induced more aggressive activation of astroglia and inflammation in AT mice, which might be through activation of the NF-κB pathway
Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is also a crucial pathological process and the key factor is glial activation, especially microglial activation.
It has already been reported that chronic Nrf2 deficient microglia leads to neuroinflammation and AD, and loss of Nrf2 primed microglia toward inflammatory phenotype with an increase in Clec7a and CD68 markers
Nrf2 knockout in aged mice leads to increased reactive microglia, proinflammatory cytokines, and infiltrating immune cells in the brain with AD-like impairment.
Nrf2 knockout microglia showed increased NF-κB p65 and CD86 suggesting inflammatory phenotypes.
Moreover, loss of Nrf2 leads to the reduction in microglial expressions of P2ry12, Tmem119, Gpr34, Tgfbr1, and Mafb, suggesting the Nrf2dependent regulation of microglial homeostasis.
On the other hand, astrocytes are also well-known for active involvement in AD disease progression by influencing accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress.
It has been shown that Presenilin 1 mutated (PSEN1 E9) AD patient astrocytes have altered cytokine secretion upon inflammatory stimulation and exploits higher oxidative metabolism, thereby leading to the high production of ROS than healthy control astrocytes
The same study shows that inflammation activates the metabolism of human astrocytes.
In a consecutive study, it has been shown that Nrf2 activation reduces amyloid secretion, cytokine release, with a subsequent increase in GSH secretion in AD astrocytes
Activation of Nrf2 also enhances the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of glycolysis.
It is well established that inflammation is a complex interplay of different pathways.
In this context, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, HMOX1, EC 1.14.99.3), is an inducible 32 kDa protein which is responsible for the catalysis of the rate-limiting step of oxidative heme degradation which converts heme into three bioactive products namely free iron, carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin.
Biliverdin is further rapidly converted into bilirubin and plays crucial roles in inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress
Nrf2 directly regulates the expression of the HMOX1 gene responsible for the activity of HO-1 enzyme.
Several in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown the role of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression for the antiinflammatory activity.
In presence of AD, HO-1 is observed to be increased in the temporal cortex and hippocampus in human brains
Hippocampal expression of mutated tau induces increase in HO-1 and GCLC transcripts in wild type mice but not in Nrf2 knockout mice, indicating the crucial role of Nrf2 in the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation
Apart from this, NF-κB p65 subunit downregulated the Nrf2-ARE pathway at transcriptional level by competitive interaction with the CH1-KIX domain of CREB-binding protein (CBP), which results in Nrf2 inactivation, or by the recruitment of the corepressor histone deacetylase 3 to ARE, thus promoting local histone hypoacetylation
Accordingly, silencing of p65 by knockdown promotes Nrf2 complex formation with CBP
A study in primary cultured astrocytes from Nrf2 wild type or knockout mice exposed with oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) has shown activation of NF-κB and an up-regulation of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines in astrocytes.
Moreover, this upregulation was much greater in knockout astrocytes than in wild type astrocytes
Recently a study was conducted in a transgenic mouse that combines amyloidopathy and tauopathy with either wild type (AT-Nrf2-WT) or Nrf2deficiency (AT-Nrf2-KO)
The results showed that AT-Nrf2-WT mice died prematurely, at around 14 months of age, due to motor deficits and a terminal spinal deformity, whereas AT-Nrf2-KO mice died roughly 2 months earlier.
Nrf2-deficiency mice showed exacerbated astrogliosis and microgliosis, with a significant increase in GFAP, IBA1 and CD11b levels.
However, treatment with Nrf2 activator, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) showed a reduction in proinflammatory mediators COX2 and NOS2, as well as the gliosis markers GFAP, IBA1 and MHCII with a significant increase in the expression of Nrf2, Nqo1, Osgin1, and Gstm1 in the brain, thereby preventing cognition and motor complications
With aging, the cerebral blood vessels of Nrf2-deficient mice showed enhanced senescence markers, aging-induced vascular inflammation and blood-brain barrier leakage
Astrocytes provide trophic support for neurons, promote formation and function of synapses, and prune synapses by phagocytosis, in addition to fulfilling a range of other homeostatic maintenance functions
Astrocytes undergo a dramatic transformation called "reactive astrocytosis" after brain injury and disease.
Liddelow and colleagues have shown that activated microglia is able to induce pro-inflammatory astrocytes, designated as A1-astrocytes, via secretion of IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q both in vitro and in vivo.
This subset of astrocytes changes their expression profile and phenotype to form neurotoxic reactive astrocytes.
Indeed, A1s lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce death of neurons and oligodendrocytes
The authors also show that A1s are highly present in human neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD.
Silencing by either knockout gene or antibody drugs for IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q inhibit A1 reactive astrocyte formation, therefore, this pathway has a therapeutic value in neurodegenerative diseases
A prolonged dysfunction of astrocytes and microglia activation reportedly accelerate the degeneration of SNpc dopaminergic neurons during early dysfunction induced by 6-OHDA lesion in rats
Upon activation to the M1 phenotype, microglia secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic molecules leading to the inflammation and cytotoxic responses.
In contrast, the M2 polarized microglia secrete antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, neurotrophic factors (e.g., BDNF and IGF-1), and extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin
With age, the failure of the astrocytic Nrf2-antioxidant axis response upon inflammation and oxidative stress significantly influences VM astrocyte-microglia-neuron interactions
At the SNpc level, aging-induced decline of astrocytic Nrf2 gene expression promotes an up-regulation of major microglial proinflammatory gene expressions, such as TNF-α, IL1β, IL-6 and Nos2 both at striatal
In a very recent study, NRF2 knockout and wild-type mice that overexpress human α-Syn (hα-Syn + /Nrf2 -/-and hα-Syn + /Nrf2 +/+ respectively) were developed and an increased phosphorylation and oligomerization of α-Syn was observed in hα-Syn + /Nrf2 -/-mice.
Further analysis showed a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expressing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra with amplified oxidative stress, higher inflammatory markers including COX-2 and iNOS-2 levels and an increased autophagic burden, especially in the midbrain, striatum and cortical brain regions

POTENTIAL NRF2 ACTIVATORS TOWARD NEUROINFLAMMATION CLINICAL TRIALS
So far, we discussed different aspects of Nrf2 signaling pathway in oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, therefore, it is also worthwhile to discuss compounds and natural products which could modulate Nrf2-dependent treatment of neuroinflammation.
Extensive research has been focused till date on identifying the agents/factors that regulate the association between Nrf2 and Keap1 and there are many chemical compounds, and natural products that have been identified as Nrf2 activators in neuroinflammation
In this context, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), is the only drug so far approved by US Food and Drug Administration and marketed by Biogen, as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent in multiple sclerosis with the ability to inhibit inflammation via Nrf2 antioxidant pathway
More importantly, in a pre-clinical study performed in an animal model of PD, it was observed that the oral administration of DMF protected nigral dopaminergic neurons against α-synuclein toxicity and reduced astrocytosis and microgliosis from stereotaxic delivery to the ventral midbrain of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector expressing human α-synuclein
Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that the neuroprotective effect of DMF was associated with the altered regulation of autophagy markers SQTSM1/p62 and LC3 in MN9D, BV2 and IMA 2.1 and a switch in microglial phenotype toward a less pro-inflammatory type
DMF and its bioactive metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) activate in vitro the Nrf2 pathway by promoting S-alkylation of Keap1 and by determining nuclear exit of the Nrf2 repressor Bach1
Nrf2 activation by DMF was associated with glutathione depletion, decreased cell viability, and inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis rates, whereas MMF determined an increase of these activities.
However, despite these differences, both DMF and MMF showed neuroprotective effects and blocked neurotoxicity in a mouse model of PD.
Interestingly, this effect was not observed in Nrf2 null mice
Mechanistically, Linker and colleagues demonstrated that in an animal model of chronic multiple sclerosis DMF treatment improved preservation of myelin, axons and neurons
In the same study, in vitro experiments demonstrated that fumarates were able to increase murine neuronal survival and to protect human or rodent astrocytes against oxidative stress.
Moreover, it was observed that MMF was able to promote Nrf2 activation by determining a direct modification of Keap1 at cysteine residue 151
More recently, a study performed in human astrocytes demonstrated that cytoprotective activity of MMF is mediated by the upregulation of the oxidative stress induced growth inhibitor 1 (OSGIN1)-61 kDa isoform
MMF-induced OSGIN1 expression is NRF2-dependent and modulates inflammatory markers thus contributing to cell protection against oxidative challenge
More recently, Bach1 inhibitor by vTv Therapeutics (High Point NC, USA) proved to be effective against MPTP-induced dopinergic neurodegeneration via Nrf2 activation
Another compound has been identified to bind Keap1 in the in vitro assay in the low micromolar range, by Biogen Idec, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Celgene Corporation (USA), Evotec AG (Germany), and NoValix (France)
Another compound within the isothiocyanate group of organosulfur compounds, Sulforaphane (SFN), activates Nrf2 in the basal ganglia leading to the upregulation of phase II antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO1
Importantly, SFN treatment activates Nrf2-dependent pathway to restore glutathione and MTS metabolism in PD hONS cultures
In wild-type mice, SFN protected against parkinsonian toxin methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced death of nigral dopaminergic neurons by reducing astrogliosis, microgliosis, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
Similar effects have also been shown by SFN treatment in other animal models of PD
Sulforaphane, originally isolated from Brassicaceae plants, has been enrolled in clinical trials (NCT04213391) for the treatment of AD based on Nrf2 activation.
However, sulforaphane is relatively unstable at room temperature.
In this context, its synthetic analogs such as SFX-01 (Evgen Pharma developed drug) are attracting considerable attention for AD drug development.
The expression of HO-1 in microglial cells was observed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of compounds such as schizandrin C
Moreover, in tauopathy, NRF2-and fractalkine receptor-knock out mice did not express HO-1 in microglia, suggesting their crucial role in the mitigation of neuroinflammation
Cryptotanshinone, a monomer compound, can attenuate LPSinduced neuroinflammation via Nrf2/ HO-1 signaling pathway in BV-2 microglial cells
Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, significantly attenuated the LPS-induced synaptic loss in the cortex and hippocampus of the adult mouse brain
Quercetin protects against mitochondria dysfunction and progressive dopaminergic degeneration of neurons in experimental models of PD
Quercetin also shows an improvement in cognitive impairment in 6-OHDA-induced PD
In another study, quercetin prevents NO and iNOS over-expression in PC12 cells and down-regulates pro-inflammatory genes expressions (IL-1ß, COX-2 and TNF-α) in zebrafish
Treatment with synthetic triterpenoids such as CDDO-methyl amide
(2-cyano-N-methyl-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28 amide; CDDO-MA) of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in Nrf2 activation and translocation from cytosol to nucleus and significant protection against MPTP-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, pathological α-synuclein accumulation and oxidative damage in mice
CDDO-MA treatment of fibroblasts from wild type, but not from Nrf2 knockout mice, inhibited ROS production induced by t-butylhydroperoxide by promoting the activation of ARE genes
The two structural analogs of CDDO (TP-319 and TP-500), obtained by the cyclization of squalene, have demonstrated improved blood-brain-barrier permeability, and protected against oxidative stress and inflammation in MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice
This activity was Nrf2-dependent as treatment of Nrf2 knockout mice with these CDDO analogs failed to inhibit MPTP neurotoxicity and to induce Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective genes
Another potent Nrf2 activator, KKPA4026 was identified by virtual screening of the Asinex and Chemdiv databases
KKPA4026 was demonstrated to induce the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 in BV-2 cells.
Furthermore, in the MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, KKPA4026 was able to reduce behavioral deficits and protected dopaminergic neurons in an Nrf2-dependent manner.
Similarly, a recent report showed a novel therapeutic candidate ALGERNON2 (altered generation of neurons 2) reduced the proinflammatory cytokines secretion and stabilized cyclinD1/p21 complex by inhibiting Dyrk1A activity, leading to Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses in a MPTP-induced PD model
Interestingly, this compound enhanced neuronal survival also in other neuroinflammatory conditions, particularly in the transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons into murine brains, thus confirming the therapeutic potential of ALGERNON2 in neuroinflammation-triggered neurodegeneration conditions

CONCLUSIONS
Oxidative damage and neuroinflammation are the key regulators in the pathogenesis of AD and PD.
Therefore, one way to prevent these oxidative stress and inflammation is to upregulate the endogenous protection system in the neuronal cells.
Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway is the hallmark of redox signaling and controlled neuroinflammation.
Here, we reviewed ongoing scientific literature about regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway in different aspects of neuroinflammation and related cognitive impairment.
However, there are still some mechanisms such as interactions between Nrf2 and JAK/STAT signaling in neuronal cells that needs to be studied.
Although many clinical studies and pharmaceutical companies are currently targeting Keap1, the key regulator of Nrf2, it is still challenging to enhance the targeting of these compounds against neurodegenerative disorders due to the targeted Nrf2 dissociation from Keap1 and its persistence in the nucleus as well as the permeability through the blood brain barrier as well as their proper biotransformation.
Furthermore, new chemical entities which have entered clinical trials for AD and PD therapy should be analyzed for Nrf2 response to determine their advantages in neuroinflammation.

An upregulation in the dopamine release could result into the oxidative stress, increased ROS production and neuroinflammation.
However, when astrocytes and microglia produces Nrf2, it activates the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory gene expressions.
