Lithium as a Treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease: The Systems Pharmacology Perspective
Systems pharmacology is a novel framework for drug research that models traditional and innovative pharmacological parameters and provides the overall efficacy and safety profile of a drug across body systems and complex, non-linear, molecular interactions.
Lithium chloride, a pharmacological compound approved for the therapy of psychiatric disorders, represents a poorly explored compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Lithium has been shown to reduce downstream effects associated with the aberrant overactivation of certain molecular pathways, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 subunit ␤ (GSK3-␤)-related pathways, involved in AD-related pathophysiology.
It seems that overactivation and overexpression of GSK3-␤ lead to an impairment of long-term potentiation and amyloid-␤ induced neurotoxicity that can

INTRODUCTION Precision pharmacology for precision neurology and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
Complex chronic diseases such as cancer, immune system, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's (AD), are characterized: by 1) a multifactorial nature, because of the coexistence of poly(epi)genetic and environmental susceptibility and 2) dysfunction of multiple networks, at both the molecular and large-scale biological level.
It is well established that spatial-temporal evolution of AD pathophysiology has non-linear fashion.
For instance, the alteration of evolutionarily highly conserved molecular and intracellular pathways as well as of several body systems cross-talks underlie the core features of the disease, including brain proteinopathies and neurodegeneration
Continuous failure of late stage clinical drug trials, following the traditional drug development paradigm in AD, demonstrates that a conceptual shift in drug Research and Development (R&D) pipelines is required to attain therapeutic breakthroughs
Systems-based biology, physiology, and pharmacology are expected to transform R&D strategies considerably, paving the way for developing biomarker-guided targeted therapies, i.e., pathwaybased treatments, specifically adapted (tailored) to the individual biology and genetics
In particular, systems pharmacology is a novel conceptual framework that models traditional pharmacological parameters, derived from pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, operating under the experimental and computational framework of systemsmedicine
Indeed, multimodal exploratory and predictive outcomes, throughout proof-of-pharmacology as well as all relevant decision-making steps, can be integrated into a single prediction model
The consequence of a standardized systems-wide approach to develop drugs will be represented by precision pharmacology-oriented R&D programs which will ultimately facilitate precise future medical strategies
In the coming future, we expect all individuals to be accurately clustered by degree of vulnerability to complex diseases and treated with preventive therapeutic strategies tailored to the individual biological make-up in line with the precision medicine paradigm shift
Through implementation of R&D pipelines with multimodal biomarkers for different context-of-use, the next-generation of trials investigating putative disease-modifying compounds will rely on robust proof of pharmacology: 1) alteration of pathophysiological mechanism(s) due to active target engagement; 2) modifications of disease pathophysiology toward physiological conditions (from molecular pathways to higher complexity network re-modeling); 3) long-term improvement of clinical outcomes upon target engagement and related pathomechanistic changes.
This biomarker-based approach has already been adopted in certain advanced medical areas (i.e., Oncology and Clinical Immunology) in which several phenotypes of cancer differing in histology, cytologic topography, and clinical manifestations but sharing pathomechanistic alterations and molecular commonalities are treated with the same drug
The advanced holistic systems-level approach of systems biology and systems pharmacology is assumed to facilitate the drug repositioning process-also known as the drug re-profiling or drug repurposing process-indicating that a drug with a recognized biological effect could be utilized to treat a disease for which it has not been registered
In order to advance the development of precision medicine and precision pharmacology in AD, the international Alzheimer Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) and its associated Cohort Program (APMI-CP) have been recently launched by our consortium and conceptually linked to the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) (available at
and the U.S. "All of Us" Research Program (available at
The APMI is an innovative research platform promoting the following objectives: 1) predicting the individual's susceptibility to developing AD in the asymptomatic preclinical phase, 2) accomplishing an accurate AD detection and diagnosis targeting early pathophysiological alterations over the preclinical course, 3) optimizing patients' assignment to treatments more likely to be beneficial with the lowest risk of adverse events
The APMI acts at the level of generating theoretical and explorative biomarker-based frameworks aimed at supporting substantial progress in the discovery, development, and validation of multimodal biomarkers (body fluids, functional and structural neuroimaging, electrophysiological measures) serving at several context of use
The APMI research activity operates at the systems-wide level consistent with the systems biology and systems physiology approaches for which complex diseases, such as AD, originate from failure of network adaptation and compensatory mechanisms leading to loss of resilience and decompensation
The final step of this detrimental cascade is represented by loss of systems homeostasis which underlies the widespread pathophysiological dynamics such as synaptic failure and loss of neural plasticity, cerebral overaccumulation of amyloid-␤ (A␤) and neurofibrillary pathology, neuroinflammation, and endothelial dysfunction
Thus, the APMI research activity, in line with the precision pharmacology and precision medicine paradigms, aims at developing effective biomarker-and disease stage-guided targeted therapies, ultimately serving as a preventive and individualized medicine
With regards to the relevance of drug repositioning programs inherent to the precision pharmacologyoriented pipelines, lithium chloride, a therapeutic agent approved for major psychiatric disorders
Although lithium chloride has been shown to effectively modulate downstream effects of aberrant molecular pathways involved in AD, it has been poorly investigated so far
The invivo and in-human tracking of tau post-translational modifications (PTMs) will be soon feasible through high-throughput technologies and breakthroughs currently utilized within in-silico sciences.
Thus, we firmly think that focusing on lithium-induced modulation of tau pathology is, at the moment, a therapeutic avenue to pursue for accomplishing preventive treatments of AD.
The preliminary phase of investigations on novel therapeutic targets, including neuroinflammation, alongside the increasing debate on the validity of the etiological hypothesis, i.e., the amyloid cascade
Moreover, it is well established that the magnitude of tau-related pathophysiological alterations correlates better with the rate of cognitive decline than A␤-induced lesions.
Therefore, in the recent years, several drug R&D pipelines investigating candidate disease-modifying compounds have introduced tau targets

LITHIUM AND THE TREATMENT OF AD: FROM IN VITRO TO ANIMAL MODELS
Lithium is the oldest and most widely used treatment for major psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression
Pharmacological and genetic studies suggest that lithium affects multiple steps in cellular signaling, usually increasing basal and decreasing stimulated activities
The main pharmacodynamic targets include inositol monophosphatase (IMP) within the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), response element binding protein (CREB), and Na+-K+-ATPase
Due to its pleiotropic effects, lithium influences neuronal homeostasis involved in the activation of neuroprotective and neurotrophic responses, in the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades, and in the upregulation of mitochondrial function
Such findings provided the basis for investigating its beneficial effects in animal models of neurodegenerative disease, including AD.
The widespread misfolding and accumulation of tau and A␤, respectively in NFT and neocortical A␤ plaques are established neuropathological hallmarks of AD.
Robust translational evidence has demonstrated that loss of axonal sprouting and remodeling of dendritic spines are primary features of AD-related pathophysiology.
It is widely recognized that loss of synaptic plasticity associated with progressive decline of synaptic function, manifested both as longterm potentiation (LTP) impairment and long-term depression (LTD) amplification, always precede neuronal death (i.e., neurodegeneration)
It has been hypothesized that conditions that favor LTD may promote the loss of synapses via a process termed synaptosis (a GSK3-dependent mechanism)

The modulation of GSK3 to slow down AD pathophysiological evolution
In mammals, there are two isoforms of GSK3, the subunits ␣ and ␤
GSK3-␤ is highly expressed in neuronal tissues, especially in some regions such as the hippocampus where neurogenesis (the process of generating functional neurons from precursors), neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity have been shown to be clearly linked to GSK3 activity.
In neurons, the GSK3 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality
GSK3, initially identified as a key regulator of glycogen synthase, to date is well known being involved in several cell processes related to both prosurvival and apoptotic signaling as well as pathways leading to cell development/differentiation, endocytosis, microtubule stability, and lipid membrane dynamics
While over 100 substrates GSK3 can bind are known
A fine negative regulation of GSK3 activity, based on evolutionarily highly conserved feedback loops, has also been demonstrated.
An example is represented by insulin that increases the activity of PKB, a kinase that phosphorylates serine 21 residue in GSK3-␣ or serine 9 residue in GSK3-␤ inhibiting GSK3 activity
GSK3 dysfunction has been linked to a broad range of pathomechanistic alterations occurring in different human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
Regarding AD, it has been demonstrated that amyloid-␤ protein precursor (A␤PP) is a substrate for GSK3
There is a feedback loop regulation of GSK3 through A␤ since the latter interferes with insulin or the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, thus, increasing GSK3 activity
Furthermore, presenilin 1 (PS1) may inactivate GSK3 through PI3K/PKB signaling
As a proof of concept, a selective GSK3 inhibitor was able to prevent the acute effect of A␤ (500 nM) to inhibit LTP
Interestingly, this GSK3 inhibitor was still fully effective if applied after the A␤ peptide had inhibited LTP, demonstrating reversibility in the deleterious effects of acute A␤.
The ability of a different GSK3 inhibitor to prevent the effects of A␤ to inhibit LTP was also reported
A link with the involvement of GSK3-␤ in chronic AD mouse models is the finding that either lithium or kenpaullone, two structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitors, reverse LTP deficit in slices from the Tg2576 APPswe mouse model of AD
Thus, it seems that overactivation of GSK3-␤ is a key factor in the mediation of the pathological effect of A␤ on synaptic plasticity
Consistent with this idea, overexpression of GSK3-␤ leads to an impairment of LTP that can be recovered by treatment with lithium
Certainly, GSK3-␤ plays a major role in the phosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau
A role for tau in pathological plasticity is also supported by the fact that A␤ inhibition of LTP is prevented in tau knockout mice
Similarly, pharmacological blockade of Cdk-5, another primary kinase involved in the phosphorylation of tau, with either butyrolactone or roscovitine, prevents A␤-mediated inhibition of LTP
Likewise, microtubule-stabilizing agents preserve synaptic markers in response to lysosomal stress
Therefore, tau could be a point of convergence of multiple kinases underlying pathological plasticity in AD, some of which are direct targets of lithium (see below).
It has been also described that GSK3 hyperactivity may promote pro-inflammatory pathways
On the flip side, a few pro-inflammatory cytokines may trigger or enhance GSK3 activity
GSK3 slows down the neuronal production of fractalkine whose decrease may result in microglia activation
Besides an effect at the synaptic level, GSK3 inhibitors also improve cognitive deterioration in non-clinical models of AD
Genetic and pharmacological manipulations aimed at stimulating GSK3 activity are associated with cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze, as well as with hyperphosphorylation of tau, reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis, and neuronal death
Conversely, GSK3 transgene shutdown in symptomatic AD mice leads to normal phospho-tau levels, diminished neuronal death, and rescue of the cognitive deficit, thus confirming the potential of GSK3 inhibitors in the treatment of AD
Similarly, deletion of tau protein in GSK3-␤ overexpressing mice significantly reduces impairment in the Morris water maze task, further supporting a role for GSK3-tau interplay underlying cognitive impairment
A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that lithium can prevent tau phosphorylation in mouse models of tauopathies
Mice overexpressing GSK3 in neurons
As a proof of concept, transgene shutdown in conditional GSK-3␤ overexpressing mice leads to normal p-tau levels, and more interesting to recover of the cognitive deficit observed in this animal model
More recently, it was demonstrated that lithium could have a therapeutic benefit in neurodegenerative tauopathies by preventing tau hyperphosphorylation and reversing hyperphosphorylated somatodendritic tau in a double transgenic model, overexpressing GSK3-␤ in a conditional manner, using the Tet-off system and tau protein carrying a triple frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) mutation.
On the contrary, lithium was not able to change back tau already aggregated associated into NFTs
Previous works have shown that chronic microdose lithium treatment reverses cognitive decline and histopathological alterations in a transgenic model of AD
Microdose formulations have shown better bioavailability and safety profiles than conventional formulations.
Indeed, microdose can be administered through routes of administration bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and liver metabolism, thus leading to high bioavailability.
It is well acknowledged that lithium's central and peripheral toxicity is dose-dependent which may substantially narrow long-term administration for chronic diseases
A similar effect was also obtained when combining microdose lithium with pyrroloquinoline quinone, a strong antioxidant compound
Notably, a recent study conducted in the 3xTg-AD mice revealed that chronic lithium treatment was associated with longer telomeres in the hippocampus and in the parietal cortex, hence providing new insights in the mechanism of action of lithium
The beneficial effect of lithium microdose is not limited to hitting GSK3-␤
Indeed, Wilson and colleagues recently reported that an innovative experimental formulation of lithium microdose release is associated with the lowering of BACE1 gene expression and overall cerebral A␤ accumulation.
They also found that lithium is associated with a neurogenic effect suggesting a potential neuroprotective property of the compound
Further experimental evidence obtained from worms, flies, and mice revealed that lithium's neuroprotective effect is mediated by GSK-3 dependent and independent pathways
To summarize, GSK-3 inhibition might lead to 1) activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) to prevent oxidative damage, 2) inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to counteract neuroinflammation, and 3) increase of Wnt-dependent gene transcription to enhance adult neurogenesis.
On the other hand, GSK-3independent effects include: 1) inhibition of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to exert anti-inflammatory action, 2) activation of CREB-dependent transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to promote neurotrophic actions including neurogenesis, cell survival and synaptic plasticity, and 3) inhibition of IMP leading to activation of autophagy and protein turnover
Moreover, it has been reported that inhibitors of GSK3 could increase the degradation of acetylcholinesterase, thus enhancing the cholinergic firing
As homeostatic regulator, lithium may prevent several pathomechanistic features related to a broad spectrum of disorders.
Indeed, several studies have clearly shown that dysregulation of GSK-3 and slowdown of neurogenic pathways play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of the so-called synucleopathies such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD)
Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of these molecular cascades are expected to enhance multilevel adaptation and compensation (resilience), from subcellular to synaptic, until large-scale brain networks, ultimately prolonging brain homeostasis

Drug repositioning of lithium for AD: In-human clinical trials
In the last ten years, human studies conducted on individuals suffering from AD have reported that lithium may improve cognitive performance as well as impact on exploratory outcome measures such as AD-related biomarkers.
Regarding the cognitive outcomes, in a meta-analysis of randomized placebocontrolled trials testing lithium as a treatment for subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia has suggested that lithium may have beneficial effects on cognitive performance
Indeed, the main finding indicated that lithium significantly inhibited the progression of cognitive decline compared to placebo and with an effect size almost equal to the approved cholinergic drugs
The rate of cognitive improvement in active treatment harm was significantly higher in AD dementia compared with MCI
In addition, more recent studies
For what concerns AD core biomarkers, lithium has shown mixed effects.
In this context, one of the earliest clinical lithium-trial in AD was conducted by Astra Zeneca
This underfunded and too short duration (only 10-weeks) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker outcome trial with an insufficient number of recruited patients could not achieve sufficient power to demonstrate hypothesized biological effects on hyperphosphorylation using low lithium concentrations among the other restrictive methodological and trial design issues.
As a consequence of the results of this trial, the NIH decided to discontinue their planned large-scale lithium trial in AD
Two years later, Fortaleza and colleagues carried out a longer protocol, with a 12month treatment period, finding a decrease in CSF p-tau181 in the active harm compared with the placebo one (besides reporting lower rate of conversion from MCI to dementia)
Therefore, future clinical trials with appropriate duration of treatment and including biological markers of AD pathophysiology seem mandatory to better explore the putative long-term cognitive and biological effects of that lithium may have in subjects with MCI.
In line with the objective of preventing the development of a dementia syndrome and exploring whether lithium may slow down AD-related molecular pathways, in 2017, Ariel Gildengers in collaboration with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has started the LATTICE (Lithium As a Treatment to Prevent Impairment of Cognition in Elders) trial to evaluate the capacity of lithium in delaying brain and cognitive changes in elderly individuals with MCI.
Of note, besides cognitive measures, the primary outcome measures will be performed by biomarker assessment analyzing GSK-3␤ activity in blood and CSF (

SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY STUDIES WITH GSK3-␤

Multiple aspects of tau post-translational modifications
The tau molecule is phosphorylated at multiple sites in a number of tauopathies.
There seems to be a dynamic molecular signature of tau phosphorylation through time and progression of a certain tauopathy or in clusters of individuals affected by certain tauopathies, such as AD.
Augustinack and colleagues found that this appears to start early and preclinical with phosphorylation at Thr231, then at Thr181, and later at clinical Ser199, this has to be further worked out including more phosphorylation sites and in subjects longitudinally through all stages to identify clusters of dynamic tau phosphorylation molecular non-linear sequences which in turn will present targets for therapies at different timepoint and different clusters of people)
In AD, increased phosphorylation at Thr181 measured in CSF is a diagnostic marker.
Many tau kinases have been identified and the list is growing, but GSK3-␤ is one of the earliest discovered and most important tau kinases.
An updated list of tau phosphorylation sites and their associated kinases can be found online (
Although hyperphosphorylation is a major PTM of tau protein in neurodegenerative diseases, it is by no means the only one.
Additional modifications include acetylation, methylation, glycation, truncation, and ubiquitination, and the molecules often interact either directly by competing for the same site or indirectly by changing the conformation of the protein, thereby affecting the total outcome.
Depicting accurately the overall dynamic leading to loss of proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases is challenging.
For instance, phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) primes GSK3-␤-mediated phosphorylation of Thr181, Ser199, Ser202, Thr205, Thr217, Thr231, Ser396, Ser413, and Ser422, but inhibits phosphorylation at Thr212 and Ser404
Phosphorylation at Ser214 and Thr217 (both substrates for GSK3-␤) promote subsequent phosphorylation at Ser210 and Ser214
This illustrates the many non-linear interactions during PTM, and the challenges encountered in influencing these processes for therapeutic purposes.

Functional consequences of GSK3-β-mediated changes
Hyperphosphorylation of tau tends to enhance dissociation from microtubules and, therefore, induce destabilization of the neuronal cytoskeleton.
Phosphorylation by GSK-3␤ of tau at Ser131, Thr153, Ser202, and especially Ser262 leads to substantial dissociation from microtubules.
However, some phosphorylation sites such as Thr50 (longest 2N-4R 441 AA numbering) that are weakly affected by GSK3-␤, lead to microtubule stabilization
Increased phosphorylation of serine/threonine tau sites at Thr181, Ser202, Thr212, Ser214, and Thr231 have been documented in the postmortem brain of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Similarly, hyperphosphorylation at Ser198, Ser199, and Ser202 is transiently increased after traumatic brain injury
The contribution of GSK3-␤ to these changes is unclear, but these observations suggest that tau hyperphosphorylation might be a general reaction to neuronal cell stress and death.
Besides being truncated, presumably toxic tau oligomers are extensively phosphorylated
Whether this is due to reduced phosphatase activity or because phosphatases cannot reach the tau sites due to the conformational changes is so far unknown.
Tau phosphorylation at sites that are substrates for GSK3-␤ reduces proteolysis of misfolded tau proteins, leading to increased intracellular stress, and enhances mislocalization of toxic tau species in dendritic spines in a Fyn-independent manner
While this tau phosphorylation leads to a variety of PTM and subsequent impact on cellular functions, it also allows, in principle, to link the individual PTM 'signature' of patients to a unique environment of tau pathology.
It is of interest to note that other modifications at tau sites can interfere with the phosphorylation kinetics or have different effects on their own.
Such modifications include, for example, acetylation, glycation, methylation, ubiquitination, and truncation.
Recent technological advances such as FlexiTau approach make it possible to quantitatively describe the modifications at individual sites
While they are not used yet in clinical practice, they have in principle the capability to report on the individual tau signature.
Another biomarker used in clinical studies is Tau-PET imaging.
However, it is unclear at this point how modulating GSK3-␤ might affect this biomarker and one of the next challenges is to develop computational models that link molecular processes such as hyperphosphorylation to these imaging biomarkers (see the paragraph below).
Therefore, in the case of lithium and the related putative neuroprotective role, it is expected in the next years to explore traditional and novel outcome measures and endpoints assessed through multimodal biomarker-based study design.
Novel emerging systems pharmacology frameworks will enable to accomplish a multilevel (from molecular to synaptic until large-scale networks) proof of pharmacology for a disease-modifying effect.

Developing a quantitative systems pharmacology platform
The sheer complexity of these non-linear dynamic interactions calls for a novel approach to develop a more predictive platform, especially when therapeutic interventions combining, for instance, GSK-3␤ inhibitors, such as lithium, with modulators of other PTM are considered.
To complicate the situation, there is some evidence that GSK3-␤ activity is highest in early Braak stages and decreases as the disease progresses
Tau hyperphosphorylation is a crucial step for A␤-induced neuronal loss and tau-mediated neurotoxicity even precedes accumulation of NFT, i.e., the Braak "pre-tangle" stage
A converging pathway initiating tau aggregation and propagation, and the distinctive biological signatures specific for each brain tauopathy, including AD, remain elusive.
A deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms such as the GSK3-mediated upstream regulation of tau homeostasis is required to determine the pathophysiological commonalities and differences within the broad spectrum of brain proteinopathies with neurodegeneration.
To date, all clinical trials investigating anti-tau agents with putative disease-modifying effects have shown their relevant efficacy and safety in animal models of AD but weak or no benefits in human individuals.
This discrepancy can be partially attributed to inappropriate study methodology and design with improper biomarker selection for target engagement.
In general, the most important characteristic of an AD biomarker in clinical trials is the mechanistic relationship with the target on trial, followed by the correlation with clinical outcome.
Efforts to generate the biomarker data and cost (for instance the high cost of tau-imaging) are also quite important.
The vast number of tau strains generated from aberrant PTM in humans indicate the need for a paradigm shift when developing clinical trials.
Indeed, CSF concentrations of tau phosphorylated at Thr231 (p-Tau231) correlate with brain NFT accumulation rates significantly better than the CSF concentrations of p-Tau181, a surrogate marker of neurofibrillary tau pathology for AD diagnosis.
We have previously reported that p-Tau231, among others hyperphosphorylated tau epitopes, may be generated by GSK-3 overactivity
In addition, Augustinack and colleagues showed that p-Tau231 seems to appear as the earliest and most prominent phosphorylated tau strain detectable in the preclinical "pre-tangle" stage of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology
Different molecular signatures related to tau hyperphosphorylation patterns occur at different times during the cellular and molecular phases of AD progression.
Such pathophysiological sequences may display interindividual differences related to the (epi)genetic background and its interaction with environmental stressors.
The lack of studies exploring such dynamics and investigating the specific tauisoforms occurring even before the accumulation NFT indicates the need for a change in approach in drug R&D programs.
Besides the established p-Tau181, a more comprehensive panel of tau PTMrelated biomarkers should be investigated.
With regard to the epidemic burden of AD, such a panel of blood biomarkers should be developed by conducting large-scale longitudinal studies in asymptomatic individuals.
Advanced computer modeling based on a formal implementation of quantitative parameters and basic enzymatic insights into a mechanism-based model is a good start to tackle these dynamic non-linear interactions.
For example, the interaction between GSK3-␤ and PKA has been modeled
In a collaboration with Cohen Veterans Bioscience, the MAPTA (Modeling Alliance for Systems Pharmacologies in Tauopathies) program was launched, where the knowledge about tau biology and pathology that is available in the public domain will be modeled, so that observations from preclinical animal models or human induced pluripotent stem (hIPSC) cells can be translated into a more relevant human tau pathology situation (see Fig.
This will allow estimation of the indirect impact of specific kinase inhibitors on the general signature of the tau molecule with possible implications for biomarkers related to target engagement in novel therapeutics.
As an example, the MAPTA project simulates the kinetics of GSK3-␤ mediated tau phosphorylation at different tau sites based on transition rates between the enzymatic reaction states and constrained from biochemical studies using either antibody-mediated readouts
Similarly rate constants for the enzymatic reaction of phosphatase (both PP2A and PP1)-mediated tau dephosphorylation can be derived from experimental condition
Finally, the interaction between these two enzymatic reactions will be modeled in an 'in vivo cellular environment' and various scenarios will be explored to reproduce experimental observations in clinical samples
This allows in principle the exploration of subsequent changes in ATP, tau, phosphatase or GSK3-␤ levels on the phosphorylation state.
Expansion of this modeling approach to different sites and modifications to the degree of specific site phosphorylation (such as Thr181) and comparison with experimentally measured CSF levels can in principle identify the activation states of both classes of enzymes.
Such an approach, however, depends heavily upon the availability of experimental clinical data on post- into oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and increased resistance against autophagy or proteasome-mediated degradation.
Some of these post-translational modifications can possibly be detected in biological fluids using antibodies or most recently and quantitatively using mass spectrometry (FlexiTau), providing a "fingerprint" tau modification of the individual patient.
QSP intends to link the difference in tau PTM 'fingerprint' at the individual patient level with treatment to these changes and ultimately to the firing dynamics of more extensive neuronal circuits that have been shown to be correlated to clinical outcomes.
Comparison between the predicted and actual changes in clinical trials allow to validate the QSP model or to identify differences that can be addressed with an improved QSP model.

translational tau site modification and might not be easily generalizable to other conditions.
In addition, the number of possible combinations of tau-site PTMs can rapidly become prohibitive for calculations, so prioritization of the biological processes will be mandatory.
A compartmental model will be developed to relate levels of interstitial tau (tau secreted in the extracellular space) to CSF tau, mostly based on rodent preclinical studies.
Furthermore, a computer model is being developed for the slow axonal transport of tau along the microtubule; the phosphorylation status of tau as determined by the competition between GSK3-␤ and phosphatase can be implemented both as a decrease in the binding rate of free tau (both monomeric and seed-competent) to microtubule, affecting the transport in neuronal projections as well as an effect on microtubule stability.
A major challenge in all clinical trials is determining the level of target exposure at the site of action.
The combination of a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP)
Using FLEXITau, differences in these PTM fingerprints after lithium treatment can be detected in human sample
The QSP platform can then predict (see Fig.
The QSP model will use these individual patient fingerprints in combination with comedications and genotypes to predict clinical outcomes which can be compared to the actual observed clinical change after lithium treatment.
This would allow to validate the platform, better understand the clinical trial results or identify areas for improvement.
Performing this operation for multiple clinical trials with compounds that affect tau post-translational modification allows to develop an increasingly better and predictive computer model that may ultimately pave the way to pathway-based therapies tailored to the individual's biological profile, in line with the primary objectives of precision pharmacology
In conclusion, systems pharmacology, through innovative and unique platforms and technologies, will enable researchers to decipher early AD-related pathophysiological signatures even in asymptomatic individuals, offering preventive and individualized strategies in line with precision pharmacology and precision medicine.

Phosphorylation as a post-translational modification (PTM, light brown) has been studied most extensively, but other modifications such as acetylation (yellow), O-GlcNAcylation (pink), methylation (red), truncation (light grey), and glycation (black) affect neuronal function.
Neuronal functions affected by tau PTM changes include loss of binding to microtubules (MT) and reduced MT stability, direct and indirect effects on synaptic function, aggregationinto oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and increased resistance against autophagy or proteasome-mediated degradation.
Some of these post-translational modifications can possibly be detected in biological fluids using antibodies or most recently and quantitatively using mass spectrometry (FlexiTau), providing a "fingerprint" tau modification of the individual patient.
