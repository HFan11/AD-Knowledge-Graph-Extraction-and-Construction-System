A Prospective Repurposing of Dantrolene as a Multitarget Agent for Alzheimer’s Disease
The orphan drug dantrolene (DAN) is the only therapeutic treatment for malignant hyperthermia (MH), a pharmacogenetic pathology affecting 0.2 over 10,000 people in the EU.
It acts by inhibiting ryanodine receptors, which are responsible for calcium recruitment in striatal muscles and brain.
Because of its involvement in calcium homeostasis, DAN has been successfully investigated for its potential as neuroprotecting small molecule in several animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Nevertheless, its effects at a molecular level, namely on putative targets involved in neurodegeneration, are still scarcely known.
Herein, we present a prospective study on repurposing of DAN involving, besides the well-known calcium antagonism, inhibition of monoamine oxidase B and acetylcholinesterase, cytoprotection from oxidative insult, and activation of carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier, as concurring biological activities responsible for neuroprotection.

Introduction
Dantrolene (DAN), see Figure
DAN is the only drug approved for treating malignant hyperthermia (MH), that is, a pharmacogenetic disorder triggered by volatile anesthetics and characterized by muscle rigidity and fatal rise in body temperature
In a MH episode, an excessive leak of Ca 2+ ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) results in an uncontrolled hypermetabolism that leads to respiratory and metabolic acidosis due to rapid consumption of energy stores and ATP
DAN depresses the intrinsic mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling by acting on the ryanodine subtype 1 receptor (RyR1) within the SR of muscle cells
In addition to RyR1, other two forms of these receptors are known, i.e., RyR2, mainly expressed in cardiac muscle, and RyR3, which is particularly abundant in the brain
DAN also reduces neuronal cell death induced by both transient ischemia and hypoxia and glucose deprivation in rats
Nowadays, intravenous DAN is successfully used to treat 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) intoxication
In this respect, some authors showed that a neurotoxic dose of MDMA in rats triggers a mitochondrial oxidative damage in brain regions, increases the lipid and protein peroxidation, and induces mitochondrial DNA deletion
Furthermore, the activity of monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO A and B) and the resulting production of hydrogen peroxide as byproduct of MAO catabolic activity are increased by MDMA-induced release of neurotransmitters.
A proof of this is the capability of selegiline, as seen in Figure
The pivotal role of MAOs as metabolizing enzymes in modulating the concentration of neurotransmitters has attracted significant attention as favored target in some severe and chronic neurodegenerative diseases
This well-established reputation is closely related to the substrate and tissue specificity of both isoforms: MAO A selective inhibitors are clinically administered as antidepressants
Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of both isoforms into the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure
The neuroprotective effects of MAO B inhibitors also provide the rationale for their potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly for the efficacy of MAO B inhibition in reducing ROS toxicity and oxidative stress (OS)
The multifactorial nature of AD and the absence of an effective and long-lasting therapy so far, have stimulated medicinal chemists to follow multitarget drug design strategies based even on repositioning of approved drugs
A recent example is represented by the antidiabetic drugs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, as seen in Figure
The high specificity shown by pioglitazone, and the crystallographic data in support of it

The high specificity shown by pioglitazone, and the crystallographic data in support of it
In addition to MAO inhibition, drugs able to restore appropriate neurotransmitter (namely acetylcholine, ACh) levels found their rationale against AD in the so-called cholinergic theory addressing the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
Albeit most clinically administered AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) show limited or palliative care, research is fervent and interesting perspectives are emerging
In this context, dual-targeting compounds inhibiting AChE and MAOs may significantly slow down the progression of AD, in addition to mitigating its symptoms
The main biochemical property of DAN in inhibiting the calcium release by RyRs suggests possible interactions with other transport systems present at a cellular and subcellular level.

The main biochemical property of DAN in inhibiting the calcium release by RyRs suggests possible interactions with other transport systems present at a cellular and subcellular level.
RyR1 has been described as a redox-sensitive system, for which reversible redox modifications of specific reactive cysteine residues (S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation) or their oxidation to form disulfide bridges, give rise to the active conformation responsible for calcium influx
RyR1 shares this redox sensitization with many membrane transporters.
We pointed at the study of DAN on carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), an antiport shuttle localized at the inner mitochondrial membrane, involved in the trafficking of acylcarnitines into the mitochondrion for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA by β-oxidation pathway and ATP production
CAC is also known to play a key role in the transport of acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC), a well-recognized nutraceutical
On this basis, we decided to investigate these off-target activities of DAN, not only in inhibiting MAO and AChE, but also in modulating CAC activity.
The neighboring proximity of MAO and CAC within the mitochondrial membranes suggests that inhibition of the former, hampering the production of ROS, may indirectly prevent the inactivation of the latter.
Besides, a possible role of endogenous ALC exported by CAC in OS conditions has been discussed.
Although DAN does not appear at a glance as a "classical" reducing agent, its antioxidant properties have been described
Thus, in vitro antioxidant potency was tested with DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays.
To deepen this feature, we also tested DAN in a cell-based method using immortalized SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in OS conditions induced by dopamine.

Results and Discussion

Stability of Dantrolene in Buffered Solutions
In order to check the hydrolytic stability of DAN in buffered media, we used a HPLC method to check the stability of 20 µM DAN in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at physiological pH of 7.4, at 37 • C. DAN was fully stable, even in prolonged incubations (92% of recovery after 60 h).
The same result was obtained for shorter (2 h) incubation times in phosphate pH 7.4 and PIPES pH 7.0 buffers.

Inhibition of MAOs and ChEs
Routine kynuramine fluorescence
Selectivity over the corresponding isoforms hMAO A and butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) was also verified.
Data in Table
The investigation of inhibition kinetics of DAN resulted in Michaelis-Menten curves fitting for competitive (hMAO B) and noncompetitive (hAChE) inhibition, as confirmed by Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots, as seen in Figure
This result provided the proof of a noncovalent, reversible occupancy of DAN within the catalytic cavity of MAO B, as already described for glitazone derivatives
In turn, the potency of AChE inhibition was seven-fold lower than reference compound galantamine; the noncompetitive inhibitory mechanism on hAChE may lie in an interaction limited to the peripheral binding site of the enzyme, without interference with the catalytic site.

Inhibition of Self-Aggregation of Amyloid Peptides
As an additional proof of the potential of DAN in interfering with AD-related processes, we investigated the effects on the in vitro self-aggregation of beta amyloid peptide 1-40 (Aβ40) and Tau hexapeptide (306)VQIVYK(311) (PHF6).
Aβ40 is used as an in vitro probe of the fibrillization process leading to amyloid fibrils and ultimately to senile plaques in AD
With this aim, we developed a fast screening method of Aβ40 aggregation using thioflavin T (ThT) as fluorescent probe and 2% 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) as aggregation enhancer
Regarding PHF6, we started from an already published methodology
Results in Figure
Quercetin was used as a standard reference for the inhibition of amyloid aggregation
The concentrations of inhibitors were 100 μM and 25 μM in Aβ40 and in PHF6 assay, respectively.
The high planarity and the extended conjugation of aromatic rings of DAN may represent a key feature for β-sheet intercalation and disruption, while the heteroatom-rich hydantoin core may behave as hydrogen bond (HB) donor/acceptor for strong HB and dipolar interactions with the peptide backbone

Radical Scavenging Activity

Radical Scavenging Activity
Previous studies
Starting from these evidences, we tested DAN in two in vitro models of radical scavenging activity, i.e., the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2 -azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical production
Both generate stable nitrogen radicals showing high absorption in visible spectrum, thus allowing easy and straightforward spectrophotometric measures.
Results showed no activity of DAN in both assays, in contrast with quercetin, which behaved as a strong radical scavenger, as is typical for polyphenols, as seen in Figure
It can be assumed that the antioxidant activity of DAN is independent from its radical scavenging properties.

Cell-Based Assay of Neuroprotection
In order to get further information about the potential neuroprotective effects exerted by DAN, we tested it in a 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorescence-based assay, measuring the production of ROS induced by dopamine in cultured SH-SY5Y cells.
Immortalized neuroblastoma cells are a widely used model for neuroprotection assays, while dopamine at a concentration of 10 nM acts as an inducer of oxidative stress
Once hydrolyzed and oxidized, DCF acts as the fluorescing probe of the OS state of cells.
In the presence of an antioxidant, or even of a MAO inhibitor, ROS burden is lowered and DCF fluorescence decreased.
Figure
Its activity is completely superimposable to that of phenelzine, a nonselective MAO inhibitor used as a positive control in Figure 5B
These results gave further proof that protection from ROS is exerted by DAN through inhibition of MAO (specifically MAO B), rather than its intrinsic antioxidant properties.

Activation of CAC Transport
CAC contains six cysteine residues whose structure-function relationships have been well studied by site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification, and homology modelling.
In particular, two of these residues, C136 and C155, play a regulatory functional role depending on the redox state of the protein.
These amino acids represent the specific target for various physiological compounds involved in the cell redox homeostasis, such as GSH/GSSG, nitric oxide, and hydrogen sulphide, inhibiting or activating the transport activity of the carrier
The formation of a disulfide bridge by oxygen exposure or in conditions of OS inhibits the transporter
Thus, it was tested whether the reducing action of DAN was effective in activating CAC, since this feature would represent an interesting intervention for restoring abnormal depletion of ATP and increasing cellular levels of ALC.
First, it was verified whether DAN entered intact mitochondria and had an effect on the CAC function.
The purification of crude rat mitochondria and the measurement of CAC transport activity are described in Materials and Methods.
The uptake of carnitine was started by adding 0.05 mM [ 3 H]-carnitine in the presence or absence of 50 µM DAN (dissolved in 1:1 DMSO/H 2 O).
The transport activity was inhibited at various times by adding cold 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in a buffer containing 150 mM sucrose, 50 mM TRIS-HCl, 50 mM KCl. Figure
Addition of DAN to intact mitochondria induced an increase of transport function up to 41% after 120 min.

To test the stability of DAN during its incubation with CAC and then calculate the maximum efficacy over time on the protein, transport activity of WT was measured at time intervals with 10 μM DAN, as seen in Figure
The graph displays how the action of DAN remains almost constant over time with average values of around 160% compared to the control.
These data may indicate that the stability of DAN may allow the molecule to cross mitochondrial membranes and reach the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier.
The reducing properties of DAN were studied on the recombinant WT CAC with the protein at different states of oxidation.

When the carrier was incubated with 50 mM DTE, recovery was 25%, demonstrating that the action of DAN is exerted on thiol groups.
To identify the cysteines responsible for the activation of the CAC carrier, the proteoliposomes of the WT protein and the mutants C136S, C155S, C136/155S, and C-lessV (C23V/C58V/C89S/C136V/C155V/C283S) were incubated with 10 μM DAN.
The increase in transport activity observed on WT (180%) was significantly lost when cysteines C136 and C155 were alternately or together mutated (C136S, C155S, and C136/155S) or all cysteine residues were replaced (C-less V), as seen in Figure

Although ALC is able to cross the blood-brain barrier

In Vitro Radical Scavenging Assays
Already published protocols for DPPH and ORAC radical scavenging were used
The scavenging of the radical DPPH • , or the monocation radical ABTS •+ , were determined by measuring the loss of absorbance at 515 or 755 nm, respectively.
Samples were prepared in clear polystyrene flat-bottomed 96-well microplates.
Briefly, for the DPPH assay, to 35 µL of test sample solutions (or vehicle for controls: ethanol containing 5% DMSO), 215 µL of ethanol solution of DPPH were added.
The final concentrations of DPPH • and inhibitors were 100 µM and 50 µM, respectively.
To form ABTS •+ , a 10 µM ABTS water solution was added to 8.2 mM potassium persulfate in water (ratio 7/3); this solution was stored to darkness for at least 16 h, then diluted 60-fold with ethanol immediately before use.
A preliminary absorbance reading at 755 nm allowed to determine the actual ABTS The cell line SH-SY5Y (obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Biological Testing Branch; Frederick, MD, USA) was maintained in the logarithmic phase at 37 • C in a 5% CO 2 humidified air in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium (DMEM) without phenol red supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 50 µg/mL gentamycin.

100 nM) were added and the plate was incubated at 37 • C and 5% CO 2 for 45 min (final volume 50 µL).
The dilutions of the compounds and their addition was performed by liquid handler ECHO 550 (Labcyte Ltd, Cannock, UK).
After 45 min the cellular medium was removed and 25 µL of dopamine were added to all the wells, except for those assigned to the negative control, and incubated for 10 min.
Subsequently the dopamine solution was removed, a washing with commercial PBS was performed and 25 µL of DCFDA solution (25 µM) were added.
The plate was incubated at 37 • C and 5% CO 2 for 35 min in the dark.
The DCFDA solution was then eliminated and a further washing with commercial PBS was performed.
After washing, the fluorescence was read immediately, and the readings were taken every 15 min in a 60-min time interval.
Fluorescence signal at 535 nm (excitation at 485 nm) was measured using Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland).
In order to isolate crude mitochondria from rat liver, a standard protocol was performed, involving cell destruction by mechanical stress, isolation by differential centrifugation in order to eliminate various subcellular contaminations, and purification by centrifugation on colloidal silica Percoll 30% gradient
The average purity of the mitochondrial preparation was monitored by measuring the specific activity of alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1).
The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase, in the mitochondria preparations was measured at 37 • C as substrate consumed per min per mg protein
The measurement of CAC activity in isolated entire mitochondria has been performed as previously described
The purified mitochondria (5 mg/100 µL) were incubated for 2 h with 20 mM carnitine, washed three times with a buffer containing 150 mM sucrose, 50 mM TRIS-HCl, 50 mM KCl, and the transport activity was measured.
The uptake was started by adding 0.05 mM [ 3 H]-carnitine (Scopus Research B.V., Wageningen, Netherlands) and the transport activity was inhibited at various times (inhibitor-stop method)
Finally, the samples were read by a liquid scintillation counter.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis, Overexpression, and Isolation of the CAC Proteins
The previously constructed pMW7-WTrat CAC recombinant plasmid
The PCR products were purified by the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Milan, Italy), digested with the restriction enzymes Nde I and Hind III (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and ligated into the pMW7 cloning vector (given as a gift).
All resulting pMW7-rat CAC constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Except for the desired base changes, all the sequences corresponded to the CAC coding sequence.
Bacterial overexpression was obtained using the expression vector of Escherichia coli C0214 (given as a gift).
Wild-type and mutants rat CAC inclusion body fractions were isolated from E. coli, solubilized, and purified as previously described

Reconstitution of Mitochondrial Extract or Recombinant CAC Proteins in Liposomes
Mitochondrial rat liver extract (0.3 mg proteins in 3% Triton X-100) containing native CAC was reconstituted into liposomes by removing the detergent from the mixed micelles through a hydrophobic ion-exchange column containing the resin Amberlite XAD-4, as described previously
The reconstitution mixture of mitochondrial or recombinant CAC proteins was composed of protein, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mg of egg yolk phospholipids (l-α-phosphatidylcholine from fresh turkey egg yolk), in the form of sonicated liposomes, 30 mM NaH 2 PO 4 at pH 7.0, 15 mM carnitine, in a final volume of 680 µL.
This mixture was passed 15 times, at room temperature, through the same Amberlite column (Pasteur pipette filled with 0.5 g resin) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 30 mM NaH 2 PO 4 at pH 7.0 and 15 mM carnitine.

Transport Measurements
Before starting the transport activity, proteoliposomes were passed through a Sephadex G-75 column (0.7 cm diameter; 15 cm height; Pharmacia, Milan, Italy) to remove the external substrate.
The turbid eluate (550 µL) from the Sephadex column was collected and used for transport measurement by the inhibitor-stop method
For uptake measurements, transport at 25 • C was started by adding 0.1 mM [ 3 H]-carnitine to proteoliposomes and stopped by the addition of 0.1 mM NEM.
In control samples, the inhibitor was added together with the labeled substrate at time zero.
The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values.
Finally, the external substrate was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-75 columns (0.7 cm diameter; 10 cm height) and intraliposomal radioactivity was measured by a liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy).

Conclusions
Repurposing of existing drugs is considered a valid shortcut to alternative therapies or, as in the case of neurodegenerative diseases, to give chances to unmet therapeutic needs
The main advantage of this approach is in avoiding the preclinical phase of drug development, thus minimizing the costs required for ADMET profiling and the business risks for companies and investors.
On the other hand, the main challenge of drug repurposing is to achieve the desired off-label activities regardless of the original therapeutic effect or balancing it into a risk/benefit evaluation for a new therapeutic use.
In this context, we disclosed new biological activities exerted by dantrolene, a drug specifically used in the management of malignant hyperthermia, which has been proposed for repurposing in several pathologies, including MDMA intoxication
In this work, we demonstrated for the first time that DAN competitively inhibits MAO B with a micromolar K i value for the human enzyme, showing, in addition, activity as an AChE inhibitor and hampering the aggregation of Aβ 40 and PHF6, i.e., two probes of amyloid aggregation in AD brain.
Regarding the antioxidant properties
A significant outcome of this work was the discovery of the activation of the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier exerted by DAN, with an EC 50 of 9.3 µM for the purified recombinant WT protein.
This transporter acts through reductive activation and is involved in trafficking of acyl groups into the mitochondria, carried by l-carnitine.
By treatment with DAN, this transport system ultimately facilitates, under OS conditions, the restoring of ATP production and thus cell vitality, and an increase of export from mitochondria of endogenous acetyl-l-carnitine, a well-known nutraceutical with neuroprotective effects
Herein, we demonstrated that the activation of CAC exerted by DAN takes place via a redox mechanism involving the reduction of specific disulfide bridges of the protein.
Such a feature, which appears in contrast with the lack of any intrinsic antioxidant activity, deserves further investigations.
Finally, DAN acts in the therapy of MH by inhibiting ryanodine receptors, which are responsible for Ca 2+ recruitment from sarcoplasmic reticulum, and are hyperactivated in MH.
Such on-target activity of DAN is in full accordance with the pleiotropic actions of DAN disclosed herein.
Since calcium dyshomeostasis represents one of the main alterations in AD, the therapeutic potential of DAN has been suggested in cellular
Taken together, all the biological activities provide a body of evidence that prompts the repurposing of DAN as a multitarget neuroprotective agent, with potential in AD to be challenged with in vivo animal models of neurodegeneration.
