Plasma p217+tau versus NAV4694 amyloid and MK6240 tau PET across the Alzheimer's continuum
We evaluated a new Simoa plasma assay for phosphorylated tau (P-tau) at aa217 enhanced by additional p-tau sites (p217+tau).
Methods: Plasma p217+tau levels were compared to 18 F-NAV4694 amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) and 18 F-MK6240 tau PET in 174 cognitively impaired (CI) and 223 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants.
Results: Compared to Aβ-CU, the plasma levels of p217+tau increased 2-fold in Aβ+ CU and 3.5-fold in Aβ+ CI.
In Aβ-the p217+tau levels did not differ significantly between CU and CI.
P217+tau correlated with Aβ centiloids P = .67
(CI, P = .64;
CU, P = .45)
and tau SUVR MT P = .63
(CI, P = .69;
CU, P = .34).
Area under curve (AUC) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia versus Aβ-CU was 0.94, for AD dementia versus other dementia was 0.93, for Aβ+ versus Aβ-PET was 0.89, and for tau+ versus tau-PET was 0.89.

INTRODUCTION
Assessing brain levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque and tau aggregation has a central role in the selection of individuals for clinical trials and assessing the efficacy of therapeutic compounds.
It may also aid earlier and more accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In a recent report, the accuracy of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 to predict the presence of Aβ in the brain using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IMS) assays was equal to 90%.
Consequently, measures of plasma P-tau have recently received much attention.
Measurement of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) was the first P-tau to demonstrate good accuracy.
4]
P-tau181 was also a good predictor of elevated brain Aβ and tau as measured by positron emission tomography (PET).
Subsequently, plasma P-tau217
and P-tau231 have also shown strong association with AD pathology with accuracy comparable to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and PET measures,
re recently a high-sensitivity Simoa assay has been developed using a capture antibody (pT3) that was raised against tau in paired helical filaments (PHFs) of AD brain.
The core requirement for this antibody binding is phosphorylation at aa217 (p217), with enhanced binding when other nearby phosphorylated sites are present, predominantly at aa212.
The recognized epitope is thus referred to as "p217+tau" and its measurement in plasma has demonstrated good concordance with CSF markers of AD in a validation cohort of 227 subjects with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 versus CSF Aβ42/40 and 0.95 versus CSF P-tau181.
asma p217+tau has not been compared to PET measures.
F-NAV4694 and
These recent generation tracers have high target-to-background ratios, giving a wide dynamic range that may improve sensitivity for detection of low levels of Aβ and tau.

METHODS

Participants
Three hundred ninety-seven participants in the AIBL and ADNeT cohorts had both
The AIBL cohort recruitment and evaluation is detailed elsewhere.
The ADNeT cohort all had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia and was evaluated as per AIBL.
A multi-disciplinary panel, blind to all imaging and blood results, classified all participants as CU or CI with MCI, AD, or non-AD dementia.
A diagnosis of CU required performance within 1.5 standard devieation (SD) of the published norms for their age group on neuropsychological assessment.
A diagnosis of MCI or dementia was assigned according to the criteria of Winblad et al.
Those with dementia but a negative Aβ scan were classified as non-AD dementia.

Institutional ethical review committees approved the AIBL and
ADNeT studies, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Aβ PET scans were spatially normalized using CapAIBL,
A CL value of 25 was selected to determine a positive Aβ scan (Aβ+)
F-MK6240 tau PET scans were spatially normalized using Aβ, was centrifuged at room temperature at 200g for 10 minutes to collect platelet-rich plasma, and then at 800g for 10 minutes to provide plasma that was snap frozen within 2 hours of collection and stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen prior to shipping on dry ice from Australia to Janssen R&D (La Jolla, CA, USA).
Plasma ptau217+ assay was performed on a SIngle MOlecular Array (Simoa) HD-X platform blinded to all subject data using the technique described previously.

Image acquisition

Samples
were measured in duplicate, yielding average precision of 12% CV (87% of the samples measured with CV < 20%).
Functional assay range (after accounting for sample dilution) was: lower limit of detection (LLOD) = 1 fg/mL, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) = 10 fg/mL, upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) = 20,000 fg/mL.
All samples were >LLOD.
Data analysis was then performed by AIBL investigators.

Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between Aβ status within clinical classifications using standard generalized linear modeling (GLM) for quantitative features and the chi-square test for categorical comparisons.
ROI, vertex, and voxel-wise correlation between the plasma p217+tau and CL or tau SUVR was performed using Spearman's rank-based correlation (Spearman's Rho accounting for age, gender, and APOE ε4 allele status was done using GLM.
AUC values between models were compared using DeLong's method.
CIs were computed using bootstrap.
False discovery rate (FDR) corrected P-values <.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Demographic and clinical characteristics
Three participants had a low CL but high Braak stage V/VI tau on
These three subjects all showed clearly elevated plasma p217+tau levels and were kept in the analysis but are displayed with a diamond shape in the scatter plots.
The demographic and clinical characteristic of the cohort are presented in Table
Of the 397 participants, 56% were CU, 22% had MCI, and 21% had dementia, of which 82% in the dementia group were Aβ+.
Overall, 170 (43%) had Aβ+ PET and 143 (36%) had high tau PET in the meta temporal region (T MT +).
Participants with dementia were ≈4 years younger than those in the MCI and CU groups (P < .05).

Correlations of plasma p217+tau with Aβ PET and tau PET
Vertex-based analysis (Figure
The correlation in all subjects between p217+tau and Aβ PET CL gave a Spearman's ρ of 0.67 (P < 10 -53 ).
The correlation was significantly stronger in CI than in CU (CI: ρ = 0.64, P < 10 -21 ; CU: ρ = 0.45, P < 10 -12 ; Z-score difference 2.6).
The correlation between p217+tau and tau SUVR was moderate to strong in the meta temporal ROI (Spearman ρ = 0.63, P < 10 -46 ) and the mesial temporal ROI (Me) (Spearman ρ = 0.60, P < 10 -40 ), but was progressively lower when the ROI was restricted to higher Braak stage regions.
In CI subjects, the correlation was again strongest in the meta temporal ROI (ρ = 0.69).
In CU the correlation was lower; meta temporal ROI (ρ = 0.34); mesial temporal ROI (ρ = 0.33), whereas Figure
The correlations persisted between ptau217+ and tau SUVR MT when analysis included only the Aβ+ participants (ρ = 0.52 in CI; ρ = 0.37 in CU).
There was no correlation between p217+tau and tau PET in Aβ-individuals (P > .05).
Surface projection of the Pearson correlation is also available in Figure

Performance of plasma p217+tau versus Aβ PET
For discriminating between the diagnostic groups, the AUC of The Youden threshold was also 126.7 fg/mL [97.4 to 177.2] for the CI (Figure
Youden index provided an optimal threshold of 100.3 fg/mL [100.3 to 137.3] for CU participants (Figure
Applying the whole cohort p217+tau threshold of 126.7 fg/mL to CU gave a sensitivity of 0.72 [0.6 to 0.83], specificity of 0.90 [0.86 to 0.94], PPV 0.66, and NPV 0.92.
The Z-score threshold for p217+tau derived from CU with <15 CL on Aβ PET was higher at 164 fg/mL, resulting in lower sensi-tivity of 0.60, higher specificity of 0.96, and PPV 0.91, and NPV 0.76 for all subjects to detect positive Aβ PET.
In CI, the higher threshold gave sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.94, PPV 0.96, and NPV 0.53.
In CU it gave sensitivity 0.43, specificity 0.96, PPV 0.74, and NPV 0.87.
Altering the CL threshold for Aβ+ PET between 25 to 50 CL had no effect on AUC.
However, at 15 and 20 CL thresholds, the AUC decreased due to more p217+tau false-negative results (Figure

Performance of plasma p217+tau versus

p217+tau versus tau PET in subregions of the mesial temporal in CU
The AUC for p217+tau to detect regional tau+ PET in the CU was higher for the meta temporal region at 0.88 [0.83 to 0.92] than the amygdala 0.81 [0.74 to 0.88] (P = .2),
hippocampus 0.81 [0.74 to 0.88], parahippocampus 0.86 [0.77 to 0.93] (P = .2),
or entorhinal cortex 0.78 [0.71 to 0.83] (P = .01).
Plotting of the data points (see Figure
shows that discordance was due predominantly to p217+tau+/tau PET-subjects with a disproportionately high prevalence of Aβ+ in this category compared to p217+tau-/tau PET-.

DISCUSSION
We determined the performance of a plasma P-tau assay that utilizes an antibody raised against the PHFs of AD.
Human PHF tau is phosphorylated at multiple sites.
Plasma p217+tau measures tau that is phosphorylated at aa217 with binding enhanced by the simultaneous presence of phosphorylation at aa212, so to may better reflect the tau of AD than single-binding site p-tau assays.
To evaluate this assay, we employed PET tracers, which may give greater sensitivity than those previously used for comparison to plasma P-tau.
prior to the rise in meta temporal tau PET.
This is supported by the vertex-based analysis of correlation in CU, that p217+tau and Aβ are highly associated in brain regions where early Aβ deposition occurs and with tau in the anteromedial temporal lobe (Figure
However, the plasma p217+tau level does not reach +2 SD above the mean found in Aβ-CU until Aβ reaches moderate levels (≈70 CL).
These findings are consistent with reports for plasma P-tau measures of p181, p217, and p231.
Wide intersubject variability in plasma P-tau in persons without evidence of AD pathology on amyloid PET remains a challenge and warrants further investigation.
Our data also suggest that tau aggregates in the amygdala region and plasma p217+tau increase together and very early in the development of AD when Aβ load is beginning to rise (Figure
The amygdala performed best in our comparison of p217+tau with tau PET mesial temporal subregions.
This may be due to a reduced partial volume effect compared to smaller structures and less spill-over effect from off-target binding in the meninges giving a more robust signal.
However, tau SUVR in the entorhinal did not correlate as strongly as tau in the amygdala.
This may be due to the effect of primary agerelated tauopathy (PART), where tau aggregates are present without Aβ plaques
First the results need validation in other cohorts and more diverse populations.
Second, this is a crosssectional study, and longitudinal analysis is required to confirm the predictive value of p217+tau as a marker of disease progression and to clearly determine when abnormal levels of p217+tau can be measured along the disease trajectory.
In conclusion, an elevated level of plasma p217+tau is associated with both elevated Aβ and tau across the clinical spectrum of AD.
Elevated p217+tau strongly supports a diagnosis of AD in persons with MCI or dementia, whereas a low level in CU persons is strong evidence against preclinical AD.

To investigate both the preclinical trial screening and clinical diagnostic performance, we examined CU and cognitively impaired (CI) subjects separately and varied the threshold for Aβ PET from 15 to 50 centiloids (CLs).

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) AUC analyses were used to explore the discriminative performance of p217+tau.
Optimal p217+tau thresholds for detecting Aβ+ and tau+ PET were calculated both using Youden's index and two SD above the mean p217+tau levels in Aβ-CU group.
In addition, 95% CIs were shown in square brack-RESEARCH IN CONTEXT1.
Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using PubMed, meeting abstracts, and presentations.Plasma phosphorylated tau (P-tau) measures compare well to positron emission tomography (PET) and postmortem across the continuum of AD but accuracy varies across p-tau target sites and assay methods.
There are no reports comparing PET to plasma assays targeting multiple sites of tau phosphorylation as typically found in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The p217+tau assay targets p217, with binding enhanced by phosphorylation at additional sites such as aa212.
2. Interpretation: Plasma p217+tau elevates early and correlates with both Aβ and tau as measured by PET, indicating that tau phosphorylation is an early event in AD and occurs with Aβ deposition.
Plasma p217+tau measurement should assist both selection for trials and diagnosis of AD. 3. Future directions: Further validation studies, head-tohead comparison with other assays, assessing the influence of co-morbidities, and the ability to measure change in brain Aβ and tau levels are required.

Figure
Figure 1A shows the concentration of plasma p217+tau in the different clinical groups, subdivided into Aβ-and Aβ+.
The mean p217+tau concentration in CU Aβ+ participants (162.7 fg/mL [SD: 85.76]) was approximately twice that of the CU Aβ-participants (71.2 fg/mL [SD: 46.63]; P < 10 -18 ).
Mean p217+tau concentration in MCI Aβ+ (247.1 fg/mL [SD: 141.23]) was not significantly different from those with Aβ+ dementia (AD) (260.5 fg/mL [SD: 148.43]) but both groups showed significantly higher concentration than in the CU Aβ+ group and the CU Aβ-, MCI Aβ-, and dementia Aβ-groups.
Levels of p217+tau in the MCI Aβ-(82.1 fg/mL [SD: 55.81]) and the Aβ-non-AD dementia (93.4 fg/mL [SD: 54.97]) participants were not significantly higher than CU Aβ-participants.


p217+tau for Aβ+ AD versus Aβ-CU was 0.94 [0.90 to 0.97] and for Aβ+ AD versus Aβ+ CU was 0.67 [0.57 to 0.77].
For Aβ+ AD versus all CU was 0.88 [0.84 to 0.92] and for Aβ+ AD versus Aβ-dementia the AUC was 0.93 [0.90 to 0.96].

36d predominantly in the entorhinal cortex.The ability of tau PET and plasma P-tau measures to detect PART is unclear and requires further investigation.Only longitudinal studies will determine if what appear to be false positive p217+tau results in CU compared to PET are due to variation and limitation in the plasma measure or are detecting very early stage AD prior to PET becoming significantly positive, and this work is in progress under the AIBL study umbrella.In contrast to the CU, the CI show more "false-negative" p217+tau results when compared to both Aβ and tau PET.Many of these false-negative p217+tau results were A+/T+ on PET, so this requires further investigation.Reflecting the impact of disease prevalence in our study population (71% Aβ+ in CI vs 21% in CU), the p217+tau positive and negative predictive values of p217+tau for Aβ+ PET were very different for the CI and CU cohorts.The PPVs were high in the CI group for predicting Aβ (0.94) and tau (0.93), suggesting that p217+tau may be a good test to confirm AD in patients with objective cognitive impairment.However, the NPV were relatively low at 0.66 and 0.65, suggesting that a negative p217+tau do not exclude AD.Lowering the p217+tau threshold to 100 fg/mL in the CI group only improved the NPV to 0.73, whereas lowering the PPV to 0.88 and at 75 fg/mL, the NPV was 0.78 and PPV 0.84.P217+tau has potential as a diagnostic tool and in combination with other biomarkers, as discussed by Schindler et al,36may increase accuracy and provide an affordable and accurate diagnostic tool.
Conversely, in the CU group the NPV were high (>0.94),
suggesting that a negative p217+tau test can largely exclude AD pathology in persons with normal cognitive test results.
However, the associated lower PPV (0.50) in CU indicates that positive results would need confirmation by PET or CSF analysis.
These findings show that triage with p217+tau may substantially reduce the number of screening Aβ PET studies needed to identify Aβ+ PET participants for preclinical AD trials, resulting in considerable recruitment cost savings.
