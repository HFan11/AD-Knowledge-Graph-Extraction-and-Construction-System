Synthesis of New Quinoline-Piperonal Hybrids as Potential Drugs against Alzheimer's Disease
Six quinoline-piperonal hybrids were synthesized and evaluated as potential drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Theoretical analysis of the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the compounds suggest that they present good oral bio-availability and are also capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, qualifying as leads for new drugs against AD.
Evaluation of their inhibitory capacity against acetyl-and butyrilcholinesterases (AChE and BChE) through Ellmann's test showed that three compounds present promising results with one of them being capable of inhibiting both enzymes.
Further docking studies of the six compounds synthesized helped to elucidate the main interactions that may be responsible for the inhibitory activities observed.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disease recognized today as the most common cause of dementia worldwide
During the manifestation of this disease an atrophy of the Meynert nucleus basalis occurs in the brain, resulting in lowering levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).
This compromises the transmission of nerve impulses in the patient body, causing serious damages on his cognitive functions, characteristic of AD.
The therapeutic approach to counteract this effect is raising the concentration of ACh through the inhibition of the enzymes acetyl-and butyrilcholinesterase (AChE and BChE), which are responsible for the hydrolysis of ACh in the synaptic clefts
For this reason the cholinesterase inhibitors have been the first line drugs for treatment of light to moderate manifestations of AD.
These drugs are the majority of the few drugs approved so far for the treatment of AD
Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are the cholinesterase inhibitors approved today for clinical use against AD.
Donepezil and galantamine are selective inhibitors of AChE, while rivastigmine is a dual inhibitor of both AChE and BChE
However, these drugs can cause side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, in addition to cardiovascular and neurologic effects.
Tacrine is also an effective cholinesterase inhibitor for the symptomatic treatment of AD.
It is capable of avoiding the excessive degradation of ACh, increasing the cholinergic neurotransmission
Tacrine is also an effective cholinesterase inhibitor for the symptomatic treatment of AD.
It is capable of avoiding the excessive degradation of ACh, increasing the cholinergic neurotransmission
However, this drug is also capable of raising the serum levels of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase, provoking considerable hepatoxicity.
For this reason the use of tacrine was discontinued in USA in 2013
Its quinolinic nucleus, however, presents a wide range of pharmacologic activities, being for this reason incorporated into a wide variety of compounds
Considering the pharmacological potential of the quinolinic nucleus of tacrine we investigated in this work hybrid compounds, merging it with piperonal, and evaluated their cholinesterase activities.
Our compounds contain the 3,4-dioxole bridge, known as a good acceptor of hydrogen bonds-a fact that may increase their capacity of inhibiting AChE
We also evaluated the inclusion of a guanylhydrazone group in order to investigate the effects of this group inside AChE.
This functional group is still little investigated in the literature as a cholinesterase inhibitor.
Our group has pioneered this research in a previous work
These compounds were evaluated against AChE through Ellman's and NMR studies and presented inhibitory activity of AChE from Electrophorus electricus (EeAChE), confirming the guanylhydrazones as potential inhibitors of AChE.
We believe that this activity is due to the presence of the cationic groups, able to interact with the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE
Structures of guanylhydrazones capable of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reported by Petronilho et al.

Results and Discussion

Synthesis of the Quinoline-Piperonal Hybrids
The synthetic route of this work started with the transformations of piperonal into intermediates 6-nitro-1,3-benzodioxole-5-carbaldehyde (1) and 6-amino-1,3-benzodioxole-5-carbaldehyde (2), as shown in Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Synthesis of intermediates
The hybrids piperonal-quinoline were synthesized from condensations via Friedländer reaction
Due to the characteristics of the dicarbonyl compound used, the synthesis of compound (3) was performed under acid media.
The acid catalysis promotes the protonation of one of the carbonyl groups of the di-carbonyl compound, allowing the formation of a double bond inside the ring and favoring the nucleophile attack to intermediate (2).
This way the aldol bond is formed, followed by the imine formation (see mechanism in Figure
Through this reaction, compound (3) was obtained as a brown solid with melting point ranging between 176-178 °C, and 68% of yield

Tacrine, a non-selective inhibitor of both enzymes, with major selectivity towards BChE, instead of AChE
The compounds synthesized in this work were designed with a dioxole ring because according to the literature this ring is important for AChE inhibition, due to the capacity of accepting H-bonds of the 3,4-dioxole moiety
Our compounds also present two aromatic rings in the middle of the molecule.
This confers rigidity and planarity, allowing π-π interactions with the aromatic residues of the AChE gorge
Comparing compounds (3) and (8) it is possible to see that they differ only by the substitution of a carbonyl group in compound (3) by an amino-guanidine in compound (8).
This structural change conferred to (8) an inhibitory activity over EeAChE six times higher than (3), besides making this compound also active towards EqBChE.

NMR Analysis
The NMR analysis of compounds was executed using a Varian 600 MHz (Premium compact TM) using tubes of 5 mm and DMSO-d 6 as solvent.
All spectra were executed at 25 • C and using 20 mg of each sample.
The NMR spectra produced were 1 H, 13 C, APT, Gated Decoupling 13 C, gHSQC, gHMBC and ROESY-1D.

Structure Optimization and Calculation of Pharmacokinetic and Toxicological Properties
As before
In addition, the values of Weight (amu), Polar Surface Area (PSA, Å 2 ), Area (Å 2 ) and their Volume (Å 3 ) were obtained.
Some pharmacological properties were calculated through the online program Pre ADMET (
toxicity, Lipinski's rule (rule of five) and blood-brain barrier penetration (BBB).
These predictions are important for the characterization of these compounds and to evaluate if they have the capacity as pharmacological agents.

Cholinesterase Inhibition Assay by Ellman's Method
In order to determine the anticholinesterase activity, we used Ellman's method
The velocities of substrate hydrolysis by AChE and BChE as function of sample concentration were evaluated for EeAChE and EqBChE.
AChE, BChE and Ellman's reagent (DTNB) were prepared in phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4).
Acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI), and butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCI) were prepared in distilled water.
Stock samples (100 mM) were prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and appropriately diluted in distilled water to the desired concentrations immediately before use.
All solutions were kept on ice during the experiment.
All experiments were performed at 37 ± 1 • C.
All experimental wells received EeAChE (0.01 U/mL) or EqBChE (0.05 U/mL), DTNB (0.25 mM), and phosphate buffer (control-enzyme activity) or sample solutions (1 to 100 µM).
The mixture was incubated for 10 min.
Then, ATCI (0.5 mM) or BTCI (1.0 mM) was added to all wells and the plate was read immediately for 5 min in a spectrophotometer (Spectramax 340PC, Molecular Device ® ).
The spontaneous and sample (100 µM) induced hydrolysis of the substrate were evaluated by replacing enzyme for buffer.
No sample-induced hydrolysis was observed for the compounds studied.
The solvent (DMSO) was evaluated at the highest concentration (0.2%) used in the experiment.
All concentrations refer to final concentrations.
The samples were tested in at least 5 concentrations.
The enzyme activity (absorbance/min) in the samples was determined by comparison with the control (mixture without sample) and expressed as the change in the optic deviation at 412 nm.
The values of absorbance/min were calculated by the software Softmax Pro 6.4 ® .
Inhibition values were calculated through non-linear regression with the software GraphPadPrism 5 (GraphPad software ® , San Diego, CA, USA).
For each sample, results correspond to average ± standard deviation of three experiments, each one being performed in triplicate.
EeAChE (EC.3.1.1.7),
EqBChE (EC3.1.1.8),
ATCI, BTCI and DTNB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, Brazil).

AChE Inhibition Assay by NMR Method
All NMR analyses were performed using an NMR method formerly used in our research group
This enzyme solution was mixed with 30 µL of ACh (100 mM in D 2 O), and then it was diluted to 600 µL using phosphate buffer (100 mM, 100% D 2 O, pH 7.4) in the NMR tube (final concentration = 5 mM for ACh and 33 nM for the enzyme).
This sample was immediately inserted in the magnet for locking and shimming, allowing for the observation of the first 1 H spectra exactly 5 min after the addition of ACh.
The next 1 H spectra were acquired at every 5 min with a single scan over 75 min.
For testing the new compound, the same procedure was performed, including the addition of 5 µL of the potential EeAChE inhibitor (final concentration of the inhibitor in the NMR tube = 10 mM) before the addition of ACh.
The concentrations of ACh and Ac were determined by the integration of the methyl signals (ACh at 2.24 ppm and Ac at 2.16 ppm).
The values generated from the integration of the signals of ACh (consumed during the reaction) and Ac (produced during the reaction) are compared between each other and to the values of Ac produced in the presence and in the absence of the inhibitor.
This enables the calculation of the percentages of inhibition, as described before
All analyses were performed in triplicate.

Docking Studies
The protonation states of the ligands at pH = 7.4 were obtained using the server Chemicalize web-based resource supported by ChemAxon Ltd. at
This server predicts aqueous ionization constants (pKa) of organic molecules based mainly on empirically calculated partial charges and parameterized H-bonds.
The tridimensional structures of the most abundant chemical species of each ligand as calculated by the Chemicalize server
The model of EeAChE inhibited by tacrine was constructed from the crystallographic structure of AChE from Torpedo californica (TcAChE) inhibited by tacrine available in the RCSB PDB Protein Data Bank (
under the code 1ACJ, and the crystallographic structure of EeAChE, available in PDB under the code 1C2B.
These two structures were aligned using the software spdbviewer
The model of EqBChE inhibited by tacrine was constructed from the crystallographic structure of BChE from Homo sapiens sapiens (HssBChE) complexed with tacrine in the active site, available in the RCSB PDB Protein Data Bank (
under the code 4BDS.
EqBChE and HssBChE present 90% of identity and the active site 100% conserved.
The Fasta sequence of EqBChE was aligned to HssAChE and further submitted to the Swiss Model server
Then, the structures of template (HssBChE) and model were aligned using the software spdbviewer
The models EeAChE/tacrine and EqBChE/tacrine obtained were validated using the server PDBSum (www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum/),
where Ramachandran plot and G-factors such as dihedral angles and covalent forces related to bond angles and length were analyzed.
After validation, the ligands were docked inside each model using the software Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) ® [44].
The binding site inside EeAChE was restricted into a sphere with a radius of 10 Å, centered on the coordinates x = 8.95, y = 68.42 and z = 64.80,
while for EqBChE it was centered on the coordinates x = 133.17;
y = 116.22 and z = 40.98.
For both models the residues 6 Å closest to tacrine were considered flexible.
The best conformation of each compound was selected from a set of 300 results (poses) obtained for each ligand, according to the binding energies and hydrogen bonds (H-bond) interactions criteria.
The docking protocol used was validated through re-docking of tacrine inside EeAChE and EqBChE.

Conclusions
The reactions among compound (2) and the carbonyl compounds were confirmed to be very efficient for the synthesis of quinolines.
The synthesis of the guanylhydrazone (8) through the reaction between a quinoline and chloridrate of amino guanidine also showed to be efficient, presenting good yields.
The compounds derived from 1,3-benzodioxole-5-carboxaldheide synthesized were evaluated as inhibitors of AChE.
The results obtained were already expected because quinolines and guanyl hydrazones are molecules with a wide range of applications in medicinal chemistry and bear structural characteristics essential to enable interactions with the active site of AChE.
The presence of the aromatic rings resembling the base structure of tacrine in the quinolines synthesized enables π-π with the amino acids present in the active site, while the guanyl hydrazone was capable of interacting with the CAS of AChE through its guanidine group.
Compounds (6) and (8) presented promising results as AChE inhibitors with results for compound (8) being similar to the known AChE inhibitor rivastigmine.
To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of this compound was reported here for the first time in the literature.
Comparison between structures of compounds (3) and (8) allowed to observe that the presence of a guanylhydrazone contributes to enhancing the inhibitory capacity of this kind of compound.
