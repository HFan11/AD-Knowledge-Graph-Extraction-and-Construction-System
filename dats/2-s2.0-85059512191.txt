Vascular dysfunctionâ€”The disregarded partner of Alzheimer's disease
Increasing evidence recognizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease with multiple contributors to its pathophysiology, including vascular dysfunction.
The recently updated AD Research Framework put forth by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association describes a biomarker-based pathologic definition of AD focused on amyloid, tau, and neuronal injury.
In response to this article, here we first discussed evidence that vascular dysfunction is an important early event in AD pathophysiology.
Next, we examined various imaging sequences that could be easily implemented to evaluate different types of vascular dysfunction associated
1. Commentary on the "NIA-AA Research Framework: Towards a Biological Definition of Alzheimer's Disease" and the need to include biomarkers of vascular dysfunction
The recent 2018 NIA-AA Research Framework "Towards a Biological Definition of Alzheimer's Disease" (referred to below as the Research Framework) outlines a biomarker system to classify individuals in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum using imaging biomarkers and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers focused on amyloid-b (Ab) [A], tau [T], and neurodegeneration [(N)]-the "AT(N)" biomarker system
The AT(N) system has been proposed to define a biomarker-based approach to diagnose AD for observational and interventional research studies but at the same time does not imply a specific order of events nor causality and acknowledges an uncertain relationship between the A and T biomarkers and disease symptoms
The Research Framework defines an individual with biomarker evidence of both Ab deposition and patho-logic tau as having AD yet acknowledges that amyloid and tau deposits may not be causal to AD
The Research Framework distinguishes between AD that is reserved for the pathologic entity (defined by amyloid and tau biomarkers) and the Alzheimer's clinical syndrome.
As Alzheimer's clinical syndrome has been shown to be a disease with mixed pathologies and AD may also be multifactorial, other factors as illustrated in Fig.
Below we use the term AD (not strictly defined as amyloid1 and tau1 biomarkers), but rather more broadly inclusive of AD as a multifactorial and heterogenous disease.
Despite the substantial evidence indicating early vascular contributions to AD pathophysiology and dementia, vascular disease very commonly accompanies AD and may also be in the causal pathway.
Below, we first briefly discuss evidence that vascular dysfunction is a prominent and early feature in prodromal AD, and, without implying a causality, order of events, or specificity, suggest that adding vascular biomarkers to the proposed AT(N) biomarker system will help to better characterize and understand contributions of vascular dysfunction to cognitive impairment in patients suffering from AD. Next, we focus on 2-18 F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), a molecular imaging biomarker for early preclinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) mentioned in the AT(N), and examine the evidence indicating that FDG-PET should also be considered a biomarker of vascular and/or blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport dysfunction rather than uniquely neuronal hypometabolism and neurodegeneration, as elaborated in recent reviews
Recognizing these concepts will achieve a more balanced view of AD pathophysiology and its multifactorial origin and provide even better tools for early diagnosis of AD as well as pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches.

Vascular dysfunction and vascular biomarkers in AD
Neuropathological studies have shown that cerebrovascular pathology is a major risk factor for clinically diagnosed AD-type dementia with clinical expression associated with low scores in most cognitive domains
A large autopsybased neuropathological study importantly revealed that 80% of patients diagnosed with AD and no evidence of Fig.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease.
AD is defined as a unique neurodegenerative disease based on the presence of amyloid-b (Ab) and tau deposits.
Additional factors (red), however, contribute to the onset and progression of AD pathophysiological changes directly affecting brain vascular system (i.e., blood-brain barrier leakages, blood flow shortfalls) and innate immune system, and neuronal health and functioning independently and/or simultaneously with Ab and tau pathologies.
This includes but is not limited to genetic risk factors, vascular factors, and environmental factors including socioeconomic stress, microbiome, and lifestyle.
Aging still remains the key risk factor for AD and also profoundly affects brain vasculature, innate immune responses, and neuronal functions (blue).
mixed (vascular) dementia had vascular pathology including cortical infarcts, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and multiple microinfarcts indicative of small vessel disease (SVD), intracranial atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, perivascular spacing, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
Furthermore, mounting evidence shows that vascular risk factors (VRFs) are associated with lower FDG-PET
Structural arterial changes leading to functional changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF)
The overlap of cerebrovascular and traditional AD pathologies is not exclusive to the late-onset form of AD but also present in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD)
It is important to extend epidemiology research beyond clinical VRFs to subclinical vascular measures that point to the mechanistic pathways linking vascular dysfunction to the various aspects of AD and dementia pathology in diverse cohorts.
Vascular dysfunction appears early in AD, as shown using different imaging biomarkers of BBB integrity
BBB permeability to gadolinium, measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is routinely used for clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain tumors
Only recently has the DCE-MRI technique been modified and advanced to detect subtle changes in BBB permeability in the living human brain with a subregional spatial resolution capable of detecting changes at the level of hippocampal subfields and different gray and white matter regions studied in parallel
Early BBB breakdown has been shown in the hippocampus and its CA1 and dentate gyrus subregions in individuals with MCI
In addition, BBB failure was found to be a core mechanism in cerebral SVD and dementia (see below)
Widespread utilization of various imaging sequences could be easily implemented to evaluate different types of vascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology.
Fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is the most common sequence used in aging and AD studies to define macrostructural white matter hyperintensities.
Microstructural changes at tissue-level interstitial fluid (ISF) shifts are easily detected on diffusion tensor imaging sequences and quantified using the mean diffusivity parameter, which several studies have shown is highly sensitive to white matter microstructural damage and correlates with BBB failure
Another vascular biomarker, microbleeds, can be measured with short 5-minute T2*-weighted sequences
Cerebral microbleeds are related to vascular wall damage by arteriosclerosis or CAA and also reflect a marker of ischemic white matter disease
In addition, the DCE sequence to evaluate subtle, subregional BBB permeability lasts about 15 minutes, requires intravenous injection of a gadolinium contrast agent, and can be obtained in either coronal or transverse orientations for individual input function analysis.
The DCE sequence has already been added to imaging protocols at several Alzheimer's Disease Centers, including University of Southern California (USC), Washington University in St. Louis, and Banner Alzheimer's Institute, and is also being used to study individuals with ADAD at USC in addition to its frequent use in patients with SVD (sporadic and genetic) and Binswanger's type of dementia.
Functional changes such as impaired cerebrovascular reactivity that reflects diminished vasodilation of cerebral vessels in response to a CO 2 inhalation challenge can be measured using either blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI
CBF reductions are detected by several different imaging methods, including pseudo-continuous ASL-MRI
Recently, using advanced DSC methods, it is now possible to specifically detect capillary dysfunction that is impaired in AD
Beyond the recognized microvascular dysfunction, emerging evidence also indicates CBF reductions at largeand medium-sized arteries in adults at risk for AD
New methods of evaluating angiography of three-dimensional vascular anatomy using time-of-flight (TOF) MRI sequences can provide several quantitative parameters such as number and order of branches, branch artery lengths and volumes, tortuosity, planarity, intensity, and so on, can be derived
TOF sequences are already used to clinically evaluate vascular stenosis and detect aneurysms and vascular disease, and they could easily be added to MRI protocols and applied to cognitively normal older adults, MCI and AD for comprehensive analysis of angiographic data with the potential to provide new insights into vascular contributions to AD.
In addition to imaging biomarkers, CSF and blood-based biomarkers of vascular damage in the AD continuum are emerging such as, for example, CSF soluble plateletderived growth factor receptor-b reflecting mural cell injury
Biofluid (CSF and blood) biomarkers of vascular damage should continue to be validated by multiple independent studies.
Furthermore, the more conventional pattern of low Ab 42 in the CSF reflects a failure of drainage of Ab from the ISF of the brain across blood vessels and by perivascular ISF flow
Moreover, imaging biomarkers of SVD are already established, well characterized, and easy to recognize, including white matter hyperintensities, lacunes (subcortical infarcts of vascular origin), microbleeds, and so on, as well as more subtle markers emerging now (such as microinfarcts and perivascular spaces)
Beyond the vascular imaging biomarkers defined previously, further inclusion of SVD features in the differential biological approach in sporadic AD, ADAD
Acknowledging and further characterizing vascular contributions to the AD and association with biomarkerbased AD pathology is important for ongoing observational studies in diverse cohorts and to target interventional strategies to prevent or slow down cognitive decline and dementia.
This may be particularly important underrepresented minority groups including African-Americans and Latinos at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and AD.

FDG-PET
FDG, a radiolabeled form of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), which is an analog of glucose, is frequently used as a ligand for FDG-PET studies as a "surrogate" marker for glucose brain uptake
Impaired FDG-PET uptake is often considered an exclusive biomarker of brain hypometabolism or neurodegeneration as proposed in the NIA-AA Research Framework
However, below we examine evidence that FDG also tracks BBB transport of glucose, and therefore low FDG-PET uptake should also be considered as a biomarker of vascular dysfunction.
Glucose and its 2DG and FDG analogs are transported across the BBB via brain endothelial-specific glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and then taken up by different cell types (e.g., neurons) in the brain via their respective glucose transporters, which does not include GLUT1
The ubiquitous intracellular hexokinase then phosphorylates glucose, 2DG, and FDG to their respective 6-phosphates (6P)
However, after this initial phosphorylation step by hexokinase, there are critical differences between glucose versus 2DG/FDG metabolic fates in brain
After phosphorylation, glucose-6P is converted to fructose-6P that undergoes glycolysis followed by pyruvate entry into the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
But, glucose analogs 2DG and FDG are not substrates for glucose-6P isomerase and thus cannot be converted into fructose-6P, which is the necessary step to enter the glycolytic pathway as well as the subsequent Krebs cycle
Instead, 2DG-6P and FDG-6P remain trapped in the brain in their 6P forms and are only slowly eliminated from the brain
For example, 60-90 minutes after 2DG
Because of very low brain glucose-6-phosphatase activity and poor 2DG-6P membrane permeability
Importantly, FDG-PET studies show diminished glucose uptake in several brain regions (e.g., precuneus, posterior Fig.
Glucose, a key energy metabolite in the brain, is transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via endothelial-specific glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) hexose transporter.
After uptake by brain cells, glucose undergoes glycolysis followed by Krebs cycle and oxidative metabolism providing the fuel for physiological brain functions through the generation of high-energy adenosine-3 phosphate (ATP) molecules, the foundation for neuronal and nonneuronal cell maintenance, and the generation of neurotransmitters.
On the other hand, glucose surrogate analogs 2DG and FDG, although still transported across the BBB via GLUT1 hexose transporter, cannot enter the glycolytic pathway or Krebs cycle in brain.
After the initial hexokinase step, 2DG-6P and FDG-6P get trapped in the brain because they are not substrates for glucose-6P isomerase, which is a necessary metabolic step in the glycolytic pathway.
Therefore, 2DG and FDG are not metabolized by the glycolytic pathway or Krebs cycle and do not generate any ATP energy-donor molecules in the brain, and their net metabolic rate in brain is zero joules.
cingulate, right angular gyrus, bilateral temporal cortices) before any detectable neurodegenerative changes, brain atrophy, and/or conversion to AD
Reduced regional FDG brain uptake in AD is not due to brain atrophy, as confirmed by studies in the posterior cingulate gyrus and parieto-temporal cortex
Longitudinal FDG-PET findings have suggested that reductions in hippocampal glucose uptake during normal aging can predict cognitive decline years in advance of clinical AD diagnosis
Diminished glucose uptake in the hippocampus, parieto-temporal cortex, and/or posterior cingulate cortex has been repeatedly shown by FDG-PET in early AD
The patterns of FDG brain uptake can also discriminate individuals with normal cognition from MCI and AD patients
FDG-PET changes preceding neurodegeneration are not only found in humans
Although FDG-PET changes in AD are typically interpreted as the result of neuronal glucose hypometabolism, in vivo dynamic FDG-PET kinetic studies in humans consistently show significant reductions in glucose BBB transport in AD subjects compared to controls
On the other hand, a few studies that directly measured hexokinase activity levels in AD brains reported rather conflicting results showing a decrease
In addition, in contrast to glucose, 2DG does not proceed beyond the initial phosphorylation step into glycolytic or Krebs metabolic pathways as shown by rodent
The lack of FDG contribution to brain energy metabolism supports the concept that FDG-PET tracks BBB transport of glucose and an initial phosphorylation step by hexokinase, but it does not dependably track all steps involved in energy metabolism of glucose in neurons and is not metabolized by neurons.
New tracers such as 3-O-[ 11 C]-methylglucose that exclusively track BBB transport and are not phosphorylated by hexokinase or metabolized should be used by future studies to specifically determine the role of glucose transport in AD as possibly an early biomarker

Recommendations
We recommend the following extensions of the Research Framework: (1) Incorporate biomarkers of vascular dysfunction to assess vascular contributions to AD using imaging biomarkers such as FLAIR, diffusion tensor imaging, T2*-weighted sequences, DCE, ASL, and DSC MRI sequences, TCD, BOLD-fMRI, and TOF, and molecular biomarkers of vascular damage in individuals with AD or dementia risk or with suspected dementia; whenever and whichever possible, vascular imaging biomarkers should be adopted in AD research studies, large epidemiological studies, and interventional trials
Integration of vascular dysfunction biomarkers into the diagnostic process may allow for earlier diagnosis of AD in some patient subsets.
Recognizing and including the wealth of knowledge on how to prevent and treat vascular disease and on interventions to modify vascular dysfunction could significantly advance research in AD and dementia, thus ultimately helping patients.
(2) Reclassify diminished FDG brain uptake by PET not as a unique biomarker of neuronal hypometabolism due to diminished hexokinase activity, but also as a biomarker tracking vascular, that is, BBB transport, abnormality.
This particularly, as a few direct studies determining hexokinase activity in AD subjects showed mixed results including a decrease
This reclassification could have profound consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of AD patients because it would highlight the potential of FDG uptake to identify therapeutic windows of opportunity before the onset of irreversible neurodegeneration.
Recent evidence indicates that reducing stroke incidence also reduces dementia incidence
Later, this year (October 2018), a one-day satellite meeting held by the World Health Summit will jointly discuss cerebrovascular and neurodegeneration diseases and the concept of dementia prevention by stroke prevention:
Similarly, managing and reducing VRFs may protect against cognitive decline because VRFs act synergistically with Ab to promote cognitive decline
VRF reduction approaches may be particularly effective in ethnic minorities at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and AD.
Remarkably, a third of elderly individuals have considerable Alzheimer-type pathology (plaques and tangles) in brain but no cognitive impairment
We are only beginning to understand some of the potential mechanisms of brain resistance and brain resilience
Finally, future longitudinal studies in individuals at genetic risk for AD should examine how changes in vascular biomarkers relate to amyloid and tau biomarker changes, structural and functional brain connectivity, and cognitive measures over time.
The 2018 Research Framework attempts to unify language of biomarker-based definition of AD, but it underrecognizes AD as a heterogeneous disease and does not clearly define AD in the context of multifactorial and functional systems contributing to disease pathophysiology.
Many factors can influence onset and progression of cognitive dysfunction in AD, which besides aging, includes genetics, VRFs, environmental factors, microbiome, and lifestyle, to mention a few (see Fig.
All these factors influence aging of the vascular system, innate immunity, and neuronal health and function directly independent of amyloid and tau, as well as synergistically with Ab and tau (see Fig.
The Research Framework acknowledges vascular biomarkers could be added when they are defined but unfortunately does not fully appreciate that several vascular biomarkers "ready-to-be-used" already exist and are well defined.
Because amyloid and tau deposits may not be causal in AD pathogenesis, as recognized by the Research Framework
Finally, rather than focusing only on amyloid and tau, broadening the perspective and study of contributing factors to AD will aid in patient-directed therapeutic efforts to apply the right drug(s)-at the right dose-at the right time-in the right study design-and with the right outcome measures for successful intervention to delay, prevent, and/or reverse dementia and AD.
Individualized, targeted therapies for AD patients will be successful when the complexity of AD pathophysiology is fully appreciated so that multidisciplinary team efforts can be mounted to successfully address one of the most challenging diseases in the 21st century.
