Natural Compounds for Alzheimer’s Disease Therapy: A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder related with the increase of age and it is the main cause of dementia in the world.
AD affects cognitive functions, such as memory, with an intensity that leads to several functional losses.
The continuous increase of AD incidence demands for an urgent development of effective therapeutic strategies.
Despite the extensive research on this disease, only a few drugs able to delay the progression of the disease are currently available.
In the last years, several compounds with pharmacological activities isolated from plants, animals and microorganisms, revealed to have beneficial effects for the treatment of AD, targeting different pathological mechanisms.
Thus, a wide range of natural compounds may play a relevant role in the prevention of AD and have proven to be efficient in different preclinical and clinical studies.
This work aims to review the natural compounds that until this date were described as having significant benefits for this neurological disease, focusing on studies that present clinical trials.

Introduction
Neurodegenerative diseases induce alterations in the central nervous system with psychological and physiological negative effects
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as a neurodegenerative disorder with major importance and the principal cause of dementia among the elderly
Microscopically, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular senile plaques (or amyloid plaques) characterize the AD.
While senile plaques are constituted by extracellular deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, the hyperphosphorylation and abnormal deposition of tau protein compose the NFTs
Aβ derives from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), an integral membrane protein that possesses the general properties of a cell surface receptor
However, this amyloidogenic pathway can be stopped by the competition of α-secretase with γ-secretase (non-amyloidogenic pathway)
The amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) suggests that the imbalance between the Aβ generation and its clearance causes the dysfunction and consequently cell death.
Aβ polymerizes in a variety of structurally different forms including oligomeric, protofibrillar, and fibrils, forming the senile plaques
Several findings suggest that oligomers play an important role in the ACH
Nowadays, it is proved that Aβ oligomers, including protofibrils and prefibrils, are more toxic than fibrils
Tau protein is also related with the ACH.
First, tau monomers aggregate and form oligomers that aggregate into a β-sheet conformation, forming NFTs
NFTs accumulate inside the neurons, resulting in their death.
The ACH suggests that toxic concentrations of Aβ cause changes in tau protein and subsequent formation of NFTs, leading to synaptic and neuronal loss
Though a direct relationship between the degree of AD and the amount of Aβ aggregates and tau levels have been established, numerous other mechanisms of neurodegeneration have been suggested, such as neuroinflammation
So, there is an urgent need to develop efficient therapies that target the various pathogenic mechanisms associated with AD.
Based on these mechanisms, different therapeutic molecules can act through different pathways
However, the currently available medications only control the symptoms in an early stage of the disease
Therefore, it is fundamental to seek for new strategies for AD therapy
Natural compounds were the first molecules used as therapeutic agents
Nowadays, the study of these natural compounds revealed that they present neuroprotective effects, arousing an increasing interest in the scientific community and in the pharmaceutical industry
A diversity of natural compounds from different origins was described to be suitable to prevent and attenuate several pathologies, including neurological diseases, such as AD
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have proven the therapeutic potential of natural compounds, however, just a small percentage has reached the clinical trials stage
Since several causes are related with this disease, the preventive properties of the natural compounds can be associated with several mechanisms as shown in Figure

Natural Compounds in Clinical Trials and Their Effects on AD
Natural compounds are an emerging approach for AD therapy.
For the assessment of their therapeutic efficiency and potential side effects, human trials have been performed in the last years.
The first natural product studied in a clinical trial was nicotine in 1992.
However, no clinical trials were performed in the last two decades for this molecule.
During the 90s, several other compounds were studied in clinical trials for AD therapy, such as vitamins.
These molecules are still being tested in human trials up until this date.
In the last years, other natural compounds are gaining interest by the scientific community and have achieved the clinical trials phase, such as bryostatin, which effects started to be evaluated in humans in 2017.
A detailed report of these findings is described below.
The natural compounds were divided into two groups: bioactive compounds and natural extracts, and they are summarized in Tables
Here, a bioactive compound refers to a therapeutic molecule while a natural extract is the mixture of several molecules.
The compounds are listed from the ones with more participants and longer duration.

Bioactive Compounds
Vitamins have been described as therapeutic compounds for AD.
Among them, vitamin C, E and D have aroused great interest.
Vitamin C (Figure
In vivo studies reported that vitamin C prevented the neuroinflammation
Also, it was observed in an AD mouse model that Vitamin C reduced the Aβ oligomers formation and tau phosphorylation, improving the behavioral decline.
The reduction of Aβ levels
On the other hand, vitamin E, which is present in several fruits and vegetables (Figure
Other in vivo study revealed that vitamin E reduced the Aβ levels
Other vitamin with reported beneficial effects for AD, is vitamin D. Adding to several benefits of vitamin D
Although the major source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure (vitamin D 3 , Figure
In vivo studies revealed that vitamin D is an anti-inflammatory compound
As result, an improvement on learning and memory performance was verified in AD rats
Also, low plasma Aβ is linked to the incidence of AD. also observed in vivo.
On the other hand, vitamin E, which is present in several fruits and vegetables (Figure

In vivo studies revealed that vitamin D is an anti-inflammatory compound
As result, an improvement on learning and memory performance was verified in AD rats
Also, low plasma Aβ is linked to the incidence of AD.
Clinical trials revealed that vitamin D increased plasma Aβ in mild cognitive impairment patients, suggesting a reduction in Aβ levels in the brain.
In fact,
Patients were randomly divided in two groups, treatment and placebo groups.
Patients from the treatment group were administered with 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks.
The obtained results showed that vitamin D intake increased plasma Aβ levels, suggesting a decrease in Aβ brain levels
Clinical trials revealed that vitamin D increased plasma Aβ in mild cognitive impairment patients, suggesting a reduction in Aβ levels in the brain.
In fact,
Patients were randomly divided in two groups, treatment and placebo groups.
Patients from the treatment group were administered with 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks.
The obtained results showed that vitamin D intake increased plasma Aβ levels, suggesting a decrease in Aβ brain levels
SanMartin et al. (
Patients with mild cognitive impairment and very early AD (n = 47) were orally supplemented with vitamin D at 50,000 IU once a week for six weeks, followed by 1500-2000 IU daily for 18 months.
The obtained results showed that lymphocyte susceptibility to death, Aβ plasma levels and cognitive status improved after six months of vitamin D supplementation in cognitive impairment patients, but not in very early AD patients.
Thus, supplementation with vitamin D proved to be beneficial in cognitive impairment patients.
The lack of effects in very early AD patients suggest that vitamin D intake is not able to delay the progression of the disease in a more advanced stage
Co-therapy with vitamin D and other molecules for AD therapy has also been explored in clinical trials.
In fact,
The main goal of this trial was to evaluate the combination of neuroprotective effects of memantine and vitamin D in preventing neuronal loss and cognitive decline.
Memantine was selected because is one of the most prescribed drugs for AD therapy
Patients were randomly divided in three groups, being administered with memantine plus vitamin D (n = 8), or memantine alone (n = 18), or vitamin D alone (n = 17).
Patients were administered with drugs for 24 weeks.
Memantine was administered orally at 5 mg per week for the first four weeks and then 20 mg per day for the rest of the trial.
Patients received a drinking solution of vitamin D at 100,000 IU every four weeks.
After the study, patients co-treated with memantine and vitamin D showed better cognitive performance than patients treated with vitamin D or memantine alone
Co-supplementation with vitamin D and other natural compounds was also studied in clinical trials.
In fact,
Patients with mild to moderate AD (n = 78) received placebo or daily supplement containing 800 IU of vitamin E, 500 mg of vitamin D, 900 mg of α-lipoic acid and 400 mg of coenzyme Q for 16 weeks.
The attained results showed that the co-supplementation did not affect amyloid or tau levels, but a reduction on levels of an oxidative stress biomarker, the cerebrospinal fluid F2-isoprostane, was verified.
Also, co-supplementation with multivitamins was evaluated in clinical trials.
In fact,
Lipid oxidation is related with AD progression.
Twenty patients with AD were randomly divided in two groups.
The first group received a daily supplement for one month of 400 IU vitamin E alone, and the second group received a daily combination of 400 IU vitamin E and 1000 mg of vitamin C. The obtained results proved that combined supplementation was more efficient in maintaining active doses of vitamins in the plasma and decreasing lipid oxidation.
Co-therapy of different drugs with vitamin E was also studied in clinical trials.
Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, that prevents dopamine degradation
For that, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 341 patients with moderate AD's symptoms for two years.
The patients were randomly divided in four groups, a placebo group, one receiving vitamin E, one receiving selegiline, and another one receiving both drugs.
Vitamin E was daily administered at a dose of 2000 IU per day, and 10 mg of selegiline daily.
Co-therapy proved to efficiently slow the progression of the disease
The combined effect of donepezil and vitamin E was also studied.
Donepezil is a drug used for AD therapy to control the symptoms.
To compare the effects of this drug with vitamin E on the outcome effects on patients with mild cognitive impairment, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted by
Patients over the age of 55 (n = 769) were randomly divided in three groups, placebo, vitamin E alone or donepezil alone.
The daily dose of vitamin E was 1000 IU, and after six weeks the dose was increased to 2000 IU, for five years.
Vitamin E proved to not be able to delay the disease progression.
For that, a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 613 patients with mild to moderate AD's symptoms for five years.
The patients were randomly divided in three groups, one receiving vitamin E, one receiving memantine, and another one receiving both vitamin E and memantine.
The used doses for vitamin E were 2000 IU per day, and 20 mg of memantine daily.
Treatment with vitamin E alone proved to be more efficient in slowing disease cognitive decline comparatively with the placebo group.
However, no differences were verified for co-therapy comparatively with treatment with memantine alone.
Although no evidence exists to support the use of selenium in the treatment of AD, some works suggest that this product has a preventive potential
A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 3786 male patients was conducted for 13 years.
The participants were randomly divided into four groups.
The first group received vitamin E, to the second only selenium was administered, the third group received a combination of vitamin E and selenium, and the fourth received placebo.
The conclusions of this trials were that neither of the supplementation regimen proved to be able in preventing dementia
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid from marine fish and algae
In addition, in vivo experiments showed that DHA reduces the Aβ levels, Aβ accumulation and plaque burden
Some in vitro experiments demonstrated that DHA decreases the βand γ-secretase activity and increases the α-secretase activity treatment of AD, some works suggest that this product has a preventive potential

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dietary co-supplementation of DHA with other fatty acid, the eicosapentaenoic acid, on the cognitive functions of patients with mild to moderate AD.
The patients were randomly divided in two groups, treatment and placebo.
Patients on treatment group received a daily dose of 1.7 g of DHA and 0.6 g of eicosapentaenoic acid for six months.
After this period, all patients received fatty acid co-supplementation for six more months.
Despite the treatment being safe and well tolerated, the supplementation with these fatty acids did not delay the rate of cognitive decline of the patients.
Quinn et al. (
A daily dose of 2 g of DHA or placebo was administered to 295 patients for 18 months.
The extent of The effects of supplementation with DHA in AD patients were studied in different clinical trials.

The extent of brain atrophy was measured, and the results showed that DHA did not alter the patients' condition.
The attained results also proved that administration of DHA did not slow the rate of cognitive and functional decline.
The same group conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study in the same year to evaluate the ability of DHA to improve the cognitive functions of 485 participants with age-related cognitive decline
The subjects were randomly assigned to a daily oral administration of 900 mg of DHA orally or placebo for 24 weeks.
The attained results proved that supplementation with DHA improved cognitive health, since the participants showed enhanced learning and memory functions.
The participants (n = 36) were randomly divided in two groups, placebo and treatment group.
The treatment group was orally administered with 430 g of DHA three times a day, for one year.
No significant side effects were verified, suggesting the potential of DHA to improve memory functions.
However, studies with more patients and longer intervention periods, are necessary to define the optimal dosage.

Discussion
Several bioactive compounds and natural extracts that were described herein to treat and prevent AD were revised and discussed.
Until this date, most of the studied natural compounds are mainly derived from vegetable sources, with just a few molecules isolated from animals and marine organisms.
Since AD is a multifactorial disorder, different therapeutic mechanisms were associated with these natural compounds.
The approval process for a new compound to become clinically available is an extremely lengthy process, and it is divided into different phases.
Before tests on humans, new compounds must be evaluated in preclinical studies.
Several natural compounds proved to be promising for AD therapy in in vitro and in vivo studies, as discussed in this work.
However, due to physiological differences between tested animals and humans, clinical trials are still necessary to validate the safety and efficacy of these compounds.
Clinical studies are of outmost importance for the development of new therapeutic compounds, drugs and devices.
Human studies allow to assess safety, tolerance and effective therapeutic doses for treating diseases.
Some of the performed clinical trials described in this review did not show significant improvement in the delay or treatment of the symptoms.
However, even if the trials do not exhibit positive outcomes, the obtained results can be still used to guide the scientists in the right path for drug discovery.
Also, some of the conducted clinical trials with natural compounds for AD therapy, showed no conclusive results due to the limited size of samples.
However, several compounds proved to be safe in human studies and were allowed to proceed to subsequent phases.
To this date, homotaurine is the only compound that reached phase III of clinical trials for AD therapy.
Despite only a few natural products having been studied in clinical trials, numerous compounds proved to have beneficial properties in preclinical studies, as shown in Figure
Based on the works mentioned in this review, 21% of natural compounds achieved the clinical trials phase.
However, it needs to be taken into account that since these types of products are commonly consumed in the daily life, it is easier to reach the phase I of clinical trials as they are supposed to be safe for humans.
Unfortunately, not all these natural products demonstrated significant effects in the AD treatment.
However, they could be used for AD prevention.
In the next few years, it is expected that the number of natural compounds being studied in clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of AD will significantly increase.
Since the enrichment of several food and beverages is a recent trend, fortification strategies using natural products could be a promising approach for AD prevention.
In fact, some groups have studied the combination of different natural compounds.
In 2009, a group started clinical trials for a beverage with supplementation of a mixture of natural compounds to be consumed by
This supplement, commercially called Souvenaid ® , demonstrates beneficial effects in the patients.
This product is already commercially available in some countries being partially financially supported by the public health care systems.

Still, the neuroprotective effects of natural compounds depend of their ability to cross BBB.
The low bioavailability of drugs and the difficulty to cross the BBB remains the major obstacles for the development of new therapies
Drug delivery systems (DDS) targeting the brain seem to be a promising strategy to increase the bioavailability of compounds and the transport across the BBB
DDS can protect the natural compounds from biological degradation and transport the molecules to the brain by masking their limiting physicochemical properties
Thus, low doses of natural compounds are slowly released in the brain, increasing the efficiency of the therapeutic effects.
Among the studied natural compounds, only a small percentage have been encapsulated in DDS for brain targeting.
Only the encapsulation of curcumin
Therefore, some of these compounds seem to be the most promising for the AD treatment.
One interesting approach could be the co-encapsulation in the same DDS of more than one natural compound with different therapeutic mechanisms, obtaining a synergistic effect.
In the future, in addition to being necessary further studies to understand how natural compounds exert their therapeutic effects on AD, further experiments to target the drugs to the brain need to be performed.

Conclusions
AD is a disabling disorder with a major negative impact on our current society.
At this moment, no drugs have been developed to prevent or treat AD.
The existing molecules only aim to control the symptoms.
With the increase of average life expectancy, it is fundamental to discover and develop new molecules able to prevent and treat AD.
Several natural products have proven to be promising for AD therapy in clinical and preclinical studies.
Clinical trials have shown that several compounds appear to be effective for AD therapy, whereas others have failed in human trials.
Natural compounds in earlier phases of research need further studies to uncover their therapeutic potential for AD.

Chemical structure of homotaurine.
This compound was the first inhibitor of Aβ aggregation that has reached a phase III clinical trial.
The participants were randomly divided in three groups.
The first group was the placebo group, and the other two groups received daily treatment with homotaurine at dose of 100 and 150 mg for 78 weeks, respectively.
The authors proved that homotaurine administration had beneficial effect on cognition[108,109]   The safety and tolerability of this compound administered to 58 patients with mild to moderate AD symptoms, were studied previously in a phase II clinical trial conducted by the same group
Patients received placebo, 100 or 150 mg of homotaurine for three months.
No harmful effects on vital signs were verified and the most frequent side effects were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.Martorana et al. (2014) conducted a study with 10 patients with mild cognitive impairment with ages between 59 and 74
The participants were administered daily with 100 mg of homotaurine for four weeks.
The obtained results showed that homotaurine improved the central cholinergic transmission.Huperzine A is isolated from Huperzia serrata (Thunb.)
Trevis.
(Lycopodiaceae) and its structural formula is presented in Figure5.
This compound demonstrated to have antioxidant properties.
Huperzine A was able to reduce ROS and lipid peroxidation in an AD rat model[110].
Also, this product presents the in vitro ability to increase the α-secretase activity, significantly decreasing the Aβ levels, suggesting a blocking action in the Aβ production[111].

Chemical structure of bryostatin.Recently,
A single dose of bryostatin at 25 µg/m 2 was administered to six patients, while three patients received placebo.
Bryostatin proved to improve cognitive functions and to be safe and well tolerated.Another phase II clinical trial was performed with the same goals
Farlow et al. (2018) administered 20 or 40 µg of bryostatin or placebo to 150 AD patients, for 12 weeks.
This study confirmed the safety of both doses of bryostatin.
Also, an improvement of cognitive functions was observed using doses of 20 µg of bryostatin.Melatonin is collected from animals, plants, fungi and bacteria and its structural formula is presented in Figure7.
This compound demonstrated to have antioxidant properties due to its ability to decrease ROS in vivo[115].
In addition, an in vivo study reported the beneficial effects on neuroinflammation[116].
Further, an in vitro study proved the ability to inhibit the β-sheet conformation and, consequently, Aβ fibrils[117], decreasing the Aβ levels in the brain of AD rat model[118].
Another in vitro study proved that melatonin inhibits βand γ-secretase activity and enhances the α-secretase activity, blocking the Aβ monomers production[119].

Only one of the twins orally received daily 6 mg of melatonin for 36 months.
The results suggest that melatonin improved the memory of the treated patient.
Also, the clinical evaluation revealed that the twin that did not receive the treatment presented a more advanced state of the disease.Later, the same group studied the effect of melatonin in cognitive dysfunctions of 14 AD patients
The patients received 9 mg of melatonin daily for 22 to 35 months.
The results showed an improvement in cognitive functions, after the treatment.The same results were obtained by
Melatonin or placebo was administered to 80 patients for 24 weeks.
Placebo was also administered two weeks before and after melatonin treatment.
The results revealed an improvement in cognitive functions of AD patients treated with melatonin, comparing to placebo.
Also, treatment was safe for both groups.
Thus, these clinical trials suggested that melatonin administration can be a suitable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.Resveratrol is a naturally occurring non-flavonoid polyphenol present in grapes (Vitis vinifera L. (Vitaceae)) and red wine and its structural formula is presented in Figure8[120].
In vitro experiments demonstrated that resveratrol induces the inhibition of studies proved a reduction of Aβ fibrils formation [121] and induced the in vitro Aβ disaggregation by an intracellular proteasomal action [108].
In vitro results showed that resveratrol has the ability to reshape toxic aggregates into a non-toxic aggregate type [109].
As result, resveratrol decreased the Aβ levels [122] and plaque levels in brain of AD rats [123].
In addition, in vivo evidence suggests that resveratrol has anti-inflammatory [122] and antioxidant effects [124].
Also, an in vitro study showed that resveratrol prevents the tau hyperphosphorylation [125].

Nicotine presents the ability to delay the amyloidogenesis by inhibiting the β-sheet structures in vitro [126], decreasing in vivo β-secretase expression [127] and inhibiting in vivo Aβ aggregation [128].
An in vitro study revealed that nicotine inhibits the Aβ fibrils formation and their length, and disaggregate Aβ fibrils [129], causing an in vivo decrease of Aβ [127] and plaque amounts [128].
In addition, an in vitro study suggested valuable effects of nicotine due to their antioxidant properties [130].
Also, the decrease of APP containing Aβ peptide observed in in vivo experiments can be the reason to the diminution of Aβ and amyloid plaque levels [131].
