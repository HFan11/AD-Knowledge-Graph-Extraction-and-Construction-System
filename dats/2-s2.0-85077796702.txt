Relationships of Cerebrospinal Fluid Alzheimer’s Disease Biomarkers and COMT, DBH, and MAOB Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
The noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes and proteins that are components of these systems can affect products of transcription and translation and lead to altered enzymatic activity and alterations in overall dopamine and noradrenaline levels.
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) are the enzymes that regulate degradation of dopamine, while dopamine ␤hydroxylase (DBH) is involved in synthesis of noradrenaline.
COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DBH rs1611115 (also called -1021C/T or -970C/T), and MAOB rs1799836 (also called A644G) polymorphisms have been previously associated with AD.
We assessed whether these polymorphisms are associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers including total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau 181 , p-tau 199 , and p-tau 231 ), amyloid-␤ 42 (A␤ 42 ), and visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) to test possible relationships of specific genotypes and pathological levels of CSF AD biomarkers.
The study included 233 subjects: 115 AD, 53 mild cognitive impairment, 54 subjects with other primary causes of dementia, and 11 healthy controls.
Significant decrease in A␤ 42 levels was found in patients with GG compared to AG COMT Val158Met genotype, while t-tau and p-tau 181 levels were increased in patients with AA compared to AG COMT Val158Met genotype.
A␤ 42 levels were also decreased in carriers of A allele in MAO-B rs1799836 polymorphism, while p-tau 181 levels were increased in carriers of T allele in DBH rs1611115 polymorphism.
These results indicate that COMT Val158Met, DBH rs1611115, and MAOB rs1799836 polymorphisms deserve further investigation as genetic markers of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Neuropathological changes of monoaminergic systems are considered an early and clinically important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (for a review, see

Polymorphisms in genes for these enzymes can lead to altered transcription and translation products, and their dysfunctional enzymatic activity consequently leads to changes in dopamine and noradrenaline levels.
It is therefore not surprising that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes for COMT, DBH, and MAOB are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders
The possible association of COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DBH rs1611115 (also called -1021C/T or -970C/T), and MAOB rs1799836 (also called A644G) polymorphisms with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers has not yet been evaluated.
CSF AD biomarkers can serve as intermediate quantitative traits (endophenotypes, proxy variables) of AD as they can reflect AD-related pathology
Increased deposition of amyloid in brain is reflected in reduced concentration of CSF amyloid-␤ 42 (A␤ 42 )
Total tau (t-tau) and visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) are also increased in CSF during neurodegeneration and their levels positively correlate with the cognitive impairment
In order to determine if pathological levels of CSF biomarkers are more likely to occur in patients with certain genotypes, we measured the levels of CSF AD biomarkers (A␤ 42 , t-tau, ptau 181 , p-tau 199 , p-tau 231 , and VILIP-1) and assessed whether they differed between patients with COMT Val158Met, DBH rs1611115, and MAOB rs1799836 genotypes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects
The study included 233 Croatian Caucasian subjects recruited at the University Hospital Center Zagreb.
While this population is clearly represeantative of a European ethnic group, by which it may not be entirely comparable to US populations investigated in comparable contexts, it is nonetheless purely Caucasian.
Of note, assessing our Croatian population using a Croatian version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) yielded outcomes entirely comparable to other population similarly assessed worldwide
Out of 233 subjects recruited, 115 were AD patients, 53 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 54 were patients with other primary causes of dementia (14 patients had dementia due to vascular cognitive dementia [AD+VaD], three had dementia with Parkinson's disease [PD], 7 had dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], 23 had frontotemporal dementia [FTD], and one had corticobasal syndrome [CBS]).
Eleven subjects were healthy controls (HC) (Table
AD was clinically diagnosed using criteria of the National Institutes on Aging -Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)
VaD was diagnosed by using the criteria of National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke -Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINCDS-AIREN)
FTD diagnosis was

Analysis of CSF biomarkers
CSF was collected by lumbar puncture between intervertebral spaces L3/L4 or L4/L5.
After lumbar puncture, CSF was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 g and stored in polypropylene tubes at -80 • C. CSF biomarkers were measured using the following enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA): A␤ 42 (Innotest ␤-amyloid1-42, Fujirebio, Gent, Belgium), p-tau 231 (Tau [pT231] Phospho-ELISA Kit, Human, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), p-tau 199 (TAU [pS199] Phospho-ELISA Kit, Human, Thermo Fisher Scientific), p-tau 181 (Innotest Phospho-Tau [181P], Fujirebio), t-tau (Innotest hTau Ag, Fujirebio), and VILIP-1 (VILIP-1 Human ELISA, BioVendor, Brno, Czech Republic) according to the manufacturers' instructions.

DNA analysis
Venous blood was collected in plastic syringes with 1 ml of acid citrate dextrose as an anticoagulant.
Isolation of DNA from the peripheral blood was done by the salting-out method
TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were used for determination of COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DBH rs1611115 (also called -1021C/T or -970C/T), and MAOB rs1799836 SNPs.
Analysis of SNPs was done using ABI Prism 7300 Real Time PCR System apparatus (Applied Biosystems).

Statistical analysis
SPSS 19.0.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses with level of statistical significance set at ␣ = 0.05.
Normality of data was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Because some groups contained small number of subjects, nonparametric statistics were also used.
Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison of the CSF biomarkers' levels among the groups.
Post-hoc non-parametric test with calculation of the corrected p value was used for pairwise comparisons.
One limitation of our study was the small number of HC available (n = 11).
Statistical analysis was performed in all subjects combined (n = 233).
Additionally, association of CSF biomarkers with SNPs was tested separately in AD subjects, MCI patients, a mixed group of AD, MCI, and HC subjects, as well as in a mixed group of MCI and HC subjects.
Only statistically significant associations were reported.

RESULTS

COMT Val158Met (rs4680)
Levels of t-tau (H test = 7.657, df = 2, p = 0.022) and p-tau 181 (H test = 6.348, df = 2, p = 0.042) were significantly different in patients with different COMT Val158Met genotype (in all subjects with different diagnoses; AD, MCI, VaD, FTD, DLB, AD+VaD, CBS, ND, PD, and healthy controls).
Levels of t-tau (Kruskal-Wallis post hoc p = 0.017) and p-tau 181 (K-W post hoc p = 0.035) were significantly increased in patients with AA compared to AG COMT Val158Met genotype (Fig.
A␤ 42 levels were significantly different in all subjects with AD, MCI, and HC grouped together with different COMT Val158Met genotype (H test = 7.354, df = 2, p = 0.025).
More precisely, A␤ 42 levels were significantly decreased in patients with GG compared to AG COMT Val158Met genotype (KW post hoc p = 0.038) (Fig.
Patients with AG genotype had normal levels of CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau 181 , and A␤ 42 ), while patients with AA and GG genotype have pathological levels of CSF biomarkers (increased t-tau and p-tau 181 levels and decreased A␤ 42 levels) (Figs.

DBH rs1611115
Significant difference in the levels of p-tau 181 was observed in MCI patients with different DBH rs1611115 genotype (H test = 8.377, df = 2, p = 0.015).
Namely, p-tau 181 levels were significantly increased in patients with CT compared to CC DBH rs1611115 genotype (K-W post hoc p = 0.036) (Fig.
P-tau 181 levels were also significantly increased in MCI patients with TT and CT compared to CC DBH rs1611115 genotype (U = 146, Z = -2.857,
p = 0.004) (Fig.

MAO-B rs1799836
A␤ 42 levels were significantly decreased in MCI patients with AA and AG compared to GG MAO-B rs1799836 genotype (U = 206, Z = -2.047,
p = 0.041) (Fig.
These results were confirmed when MCI patients and HC were grouped together (U = 313, Z = -1.980,
p = 0.048) (Fig.

DISCUSSION
In this study we showed that COMT Val158Met, DBH rs1611115, and MAOB rs1799836 polymorphisms deserve further investigation as genetic markers of AD.
Future research in this direction is also motivated by the occurrence of significant neuropathological alterations of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in AD
For example, up to 70% of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are lost in AD brains
A postmortem analysis of 118 brains showed that >20% of Braak stage 0 and all of Braak stage I cases have substantial neurofibrillary changes in dorsal raphe nucleus (the earliest site of neurofibrillary pathology in 6% of all AD cases) and LC (the earliest site of neurofibrillary pathology in 8% of all AD cases)
These findings are paralleled by clinicopathological correlations.
For example, in a retrospective review of 100 autopsy-confirmed AD cases, it was found that, on average, depression, mood change, social withdrawal, confusion, disorientation, agitation, disturbed wake-sleep cycle, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were documented more than 2 years before the diagnosis of AD, whereas the first non-cognitive symptom appeared, on average, 33 months before the diagnosis
Another study of 235 patients with early probable AD reported that only 8.5% of them were free of BPSD during the first three years of follow-up
Perhaps the most impressive confirmation of the importance of the LC integrity to memory and cognition in aging was a recent in vivo study of Dahl and collaborators
Using high-resolution, neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these authors found that individual differences across a variety of memory tasks in both 66 younger and 228 older adults strongly correlated with integrity of rostral LC
Experimental work has shown that LC input to hippocampal CA3 drives single-trial learning of a novel context
However, besides its role in memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity, LC neurons modulate many other different processes, such as sleep-wake cycle, blood-brain barrier permeability, and neuronal metabolism, all functions that have been impaired in AD
Over the past 40 years Aston-Jones and colleagues have elucidated many of the roles of noradrenaline that regulate behavior (for a review, see
One of these roles is that noradrenaline is released from LC when a subject is engaged in cognitive and motor tasks in relation to novelty, interest, excitement, or effort
As noradrenaline regulates the phagocytosis of A␤ by microglia and acts as a neuroprotective and antiinflammatory agent
It was also observed that enhancement of dopaminergic transmission ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD
Decrease in dopamine, dopamine metabolites, and number of dopamine receptors has been reported in AD
Animal models of AD also showed decrease in dopamine levels in the brain
Also, polymorphisms in genes for the dopaminergic system proteins are associated with characteristic BPSD in early AD
In this study, we compared the levels of six AD CSF biomarkers (A␤ 42 , t-tau, p-tau 181 , p-tau 199 , ptau 231 , and VILIP-1) in patients with different COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DBH rs1611115 (also called -1021C/T or -970C/T), and MAOB rs1799836 (also called A644G) polymorphisms.
We observed that the levels of t-tau and p-tau 181 are increased in patients with AA compared to AG COMT Val158Met genotype, while A␤ 42 levels are decreased in patients with GG compared to AG COMT Val158Met genotype.
Ptau 181 levels are also increased in carriers of T allele in DBH rs1611115 polymorphism, while A␤ 42 levels are decreased in carriers of A allele in MAO-B rs1799836 polymorphism.
As COMT is involved in degradation of dopamine, functional polymorphisms in its gene can lead to different transcription and translation products that can affect its enzymatic activity and consequently dopamine levels in the brain.
Val158Met polymorphism in COMT gene involves substitution at codon 158 of amino acid Val by Met
Met/Met homozygotes have four times lower COMT enzymatic activity than Val/Val homozygotes.
Val allele (G allele) in COMT gene that results in lower dopamine levels in synaptic cleft was associated with increased risk for AD
COMT Val158Met polymorphism was compared with genetic biomarkers of AD, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE)
However, the association of COMT Val158Met polymorphism with CSF AD biomarkers was not previously tested, and case-control studies on association of COMT Val158Met polymorphism and AD yielded incon-sistent results.
The G allele in COMT Val158Met polymorphism was associated with increased risk for AD (mostly in synergy with the effect of APOE 4)
Several studies showed no association between COMT Val158Met polymorphism and AD
The metaanalysis of Lee and Song
The results of our study suggest that heterozygosity in COMT Val158Met polymorphism could be protective against AD as the patients with the AA genotype had pathological levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau 181 , while patients with the GG genotype had pathological levels of A␤
The presence of a T allele in the rs1611115 DBH polymorphism contributes to a decrease in plasma DBH (pDBH) activity
Decrease in DBH activity has been detected in both brain
Given that pDBH activity decreases in early AD regardless of rs1611115 DBH genotype
Combarros et al.
However, this association of rs1611115 DBH polymorphism and AD has not been confirmed in other studies
Synergy between DBH rs1611115 and BDNF rs6265 polymorphisms was also observed, and this synergistic interaction contributed to a greater risk for AD
The meta-analysis of Tang et al.
The association of rs1611115 DBH polymorphism with CSF AD biomarkers was not previously tested.
The results of our study agree with evidence of increased risk of AD in carriers of the T allele in rs1611115 DBH polymorphism and are supported by the finding of pathological CSF p-tau 181 levels in patients carrying this allele.
It has been proposed that MAOB rs1799836 polymorphism affects MAOB transcription and translation, enzyme's activity and consequently concentration of monoamines in synapses
However, studies investigating influence of MAOB rs1799836 polymorphism on MAOB activity yielded conflicting results.
Namely, both A allele
Lower MAOB activity was associated with poor impulse control, risky behavior, and behavioral disinhibition
However, other studies
Because MAOB activity is influenced by smoking, aging, gender, ethnicity, and various medicaments
As environmental and lifestyle factors may influences epigenetic mechanisms
Although there are many indices of increased MAOB activity in AD
Veitinger et al.
The present results and existing evidence indicate that additional investigations should consider more closely the distribution of MAOB rs1799836 genotypes between AD patients and HC, as well as the association of MAOB rs1799836 polymorphism with neuroimaging AD biomarkers and APOE genotype.
In conclusion, our study shows that carriers of different genotypes in COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DBH rs1611115 (-1021C/T or -970C/T), and MAOB rs1799836 (A644G) polymorphisms have altered levels of CSF AD biomarkers.
As persons with specific genotypes in COMT, DBH, and MAOB genes are more prone to develop AD pathology (as reflected by their levels of CSF AD biomarkers), the potential of these polymorphisms as genetic biomarkers of AD is significant and should be further assessed in larger cohorts of AD patients and healthy controls.
