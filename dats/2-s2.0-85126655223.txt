Chinese Herbal Extracts Exert Neuroprotective Effect in Alzheimer’s Disease Mouse Through the Dopaminergic Synapse/Apoptosis Signaling Pathway
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an age-related, irreversible neurodegenerative disease, characterized by cognitive dysfunction, has become progressively serious with a global rise in life expectancy.
As the failure of drug elaboration, considerable research effort has been devoted to developing therapeutic strategies for treating AD.
TCM is gaining attention as a potential treatment for AD.
Gastrodia elata Blume, Polygala tenuifolia Willd., Cistanche deserticola Ma, Rehmannia lutinosa (Gaertn.)DC., Acorus gramineus Aiton, and Curcuma longa L. (GPCRAC) are all well-known Chinese herbs with neuroprotective benefits and are widely used in traditional Chinese decoction for AD therapy.
However, the efficacy and further mechanisms of GPCRAC extracts in AD experimental models are still unclear.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the synergistic protective efficacy of GPCRAC extracts (composed of extracts from these six Chinese medicines), and the protein targets mediated by GPCRAC extracts in treating AD.
Methods: Scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment mouse model was established to determine the neuroprotective effects of GPCRAC extracts in vivo, as shown by behavioral tests and cerebral cholinergic function assays.
To identify the potential molecular mechanism of GPCRAC extracts against AD, label-free quantitative proteomics coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were performed.
The integrated bioinformatics analysis was applied to screen the core differentially expressed proteins in vital canonical pathways.
Critical altered proteins were validated by qPCR and Western blotting.
Results: Administration of GPCRAC extracts significantly recovered scopolamineinduced cognitive impairment, as evidenced by the improved learning and memory ability, increased Ach content and ChAT activity, as well as decreased AchE activity in the hippocampus of mice.
In total, 390 proteins with fold-change>1.2 or <0.83 and p < 0.05 were identified as significant differentially expressed proteins, of which 110 were

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by learning decline and memory dysfunction with neuropathologically negative consequences
Epidemiological investigations suggest that the number of people with dementia in the world may reach 131.5 million in 2050
However, there is currently no disease-modifying therapies available for AD
The cost-intensive development of drugs that target a single protein may not achieve expected therapeutic results.
Traditional Chinese medicine associated with multiple targets and various pharmacological actions have obvious advantages in treating AD.
The combination of Gastrodia elata Blume,Polygala tenuifolia Willd., Cistanche deserticola Ma, Rehmannia lutinosa (Gaertn.)
DC., Acorus gramineus Aiton and Curcuma longa L.(GPCRAC) is commonly used in Chinese medicinal prescription for AD therapy, such as Tianma Xingnao capsule, which has been licensed for clinical use in China and widely used to treat headaches, chronic pain, fatigue, memory loss and insomnia
Several active ingredients extracted from these six traditional Chinese medicines have shown neuroprotective properties.
Curcuma, the primary ingredient of Curcuma longa L., have receives a lot of attention for its promising neuroprotective effects in the prevention and treatment of AD
Gastrodin, the major functional component of the orchid plant Gastrodia elata Blume, is widely recognized for its vast variety of biological functions.
Additionally, Gastrodin was able to reduce the abnormal expression levels of synaptic proteins
The main active ingredients of Polygala tenuifolia Willd.
include oligosaccharide esters (3,6′disinapoyl sucrose, Sibiricose A5, Sibiricose A6), Onjisaponin, and Xanthones
Previous study have indicated that Onjisaponin B could contribute to the restoration of cognitive ability by improving the antioxidant capacity in D-gal induced aging rats
Furthermore, Ethnocide, a physiologically active component isolated from Cistanche deserticola Ma, can help with learning and memory loss by modulating hippocampus insulin, glucose transport, and energy metabolism
Also, it was previously shown that Acteoside, which is found in Cistanche deserticola Ma, can ameliorate the deficiency of learning ability in mice induced by scopolamine
Taken together, these active components isolated from these Chinese herbs may exert synergistic action against AD through multiple targets and pathways.
Moreover, the combination of extracts derived from these six Chinese medicines have been developed as an adjunct to dietary supplements for treating AD (CuralUtra, Batch No. CM18220191028-2, Product code: T-4010-1).
It is also applied for a patent of novel formula to improve cognitive impairment (patent number: 201911113149.
X).
Even though there are lots of evidence of therapeutic application of GPCRAC extracts in AD treatment, but it remains unknown whether the efficacy of the GPCRAC extracts in AD experimental model and the further mechanism.
And, the exploration of potential pharmacological mechanisms is still a challenge in the research of TCMs containing multiple herbal constituents.
The powerful proteomics technology is now pushing forward the frontiers of Chinese medicine compound mechanism research.
Quantitative proteomics based on Mass Spectrometer (MS) has been shown to be a powerful technique for elucidating novel pathophysiological processes and possible therapeutic targets, allowing for in-depth analysis of protein expression variations.
Through proteomics analysis, we assessed the possible protective effect of GPCRAC extracts in scopolamine-induced model mice and investigated the underlying mechanism.

Behavioral Tests

Novel Object Cognition Test
Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test was performed to detect the short-term memory ability of mice.
When contacting a new object for the first time, mice will explore more frequently instead of spending time on an object they have seen before (familiar object).
On the first day, place two identical objects in a room and allow the mouse to explore for 5 min.24
h later, one of the objects was replaced by a novel object in the chamber.
Exploration is defined as mice touching or sniffing the object within a distance ≤2 cm from the object

RESULTS

GPCRAC Extracts Ameliorated Scopolamine-Induced Learning and Memory Deficit
To assess the neuroprotective effect of GPCRAC extracts in vivo, a mouse model of scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment was created.
Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test, Step-Down Passive Avoidance (SDA) test, and Morris Water Maze (MWZ) test were conducted to evaluate the neuroprotective of GPCRAC extracts on the scopolamineinduced learning and memory deficit in mice (Figure
In the NOR test, scopolamine-treated group (model group) exhibited low-level characteristics in recognize recognition index compared with control group, however, middle-dose group and high-dose group of GPCRAC extracts dramatically improved the reduced RI in AD mice (Figure
By SDA test, we detected that the treatment of GPCRAC extracts notably recovered scopolamine-induced shorter step-down latency in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
In the Morris water maze (MWZ) test, the AD mice showed learning and memory deficits than that of control group, while GPCRAC extracts with high dose group improved cognitive impairment as evidenced by the decreased escape latency to find the platform site and more crossing numbers in platform area on the final day after removed the platform (Figures
During the exploration period, decreased time of staying at target quadrant was also observed in scopolamine treated mice (Figure
Additionally, the escape latency recorded during positioning navigation test revealed that AD mice took longer to reach the platform (escape latency) than the control and GPCRAC extracts group, with the effect most prominent on Day 4 (Figure

GPCRAC Extracts Ameliorated Scopolamine-Induced Hippocampal Neuron Damage
Acetylcholine (Ach), the first identified neurotransmitter, plays an important role in hippocampal memory function and deeply involved in the pathogenesis of AD
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine (Ach), is thought to be present in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma
To further evaluate the neuroprotective of GPCRAC extracts on hippocampal neuron damage, cholinergic dysfunction as indicated by decreased Ach content, ChAT activity and increased AchE activity was evaluated.
As shown in Figure
Together with behavioral experiments, our findings suggested that highdose GPCRAC extracts were helpful in alleviating scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, thus, GPCRAC extracts with high dosage was selected for further mechanism studies.

HPLC Analysis Identified Constituents of GPCRAC Extracts
The mass spectra were recorded across the range of m/z 120-1800.
All of the data were processed using Xcalibur software (version 2.7).
The major components were well separated and detected under optimized UHPLC and MS conditions (Figure
The chemical composition of GPCRAC extracts was determined by comparing the UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS analysis with the TCMSP database (
The molecular ion peak in the positive and negative ion mode was employed for the analysis of the relative molecular mass of the compounds.
And then the compounds were qualitatively identified by comparing chromatographic retention time and MS/MS information.
Finally, 38 compounds were identified from GPCRAC extracts including such as Gastrodin, SibiricoseA5, 3, 6′-Disinapoly sucrose, OnjisaponinB, Echinacoside, Acteoside, Curcumin, 1′, 2′-dihydroxyasarone (Table

Quality Assessment of the Proteomic Data
We performed a high-throughput quantitative proteomic using three replicates of hippocampal proteomes obtained from scopolamine-induced AD mice, the workflow chart based on label-free quantitative proteomics was given in Figure
In detail, to verify whether the hippocampal proteome data of AD mouse model could be applied to further AD studies, we assessed the quantitative reproducibility (differences in technology and experimental conditions) of the hippocampal proteomes.
Normalized protein expression of per sample revealed similarly distributions (Figure
Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to characterize the degree of proteome alterations within and between hippocampal samples.
As demonstrated in Figure
It also showed a clear distinction between the control and model groups.
Furthermore, as compared to the model group, the varied samples from the GPCRAC extracts group were more compactly packed, demonstrating superior reproducibility.
Similarly, as shown in Figure
The distribution of samples correlation heatmap also indicated a good biological reproducibility of the dataset.
In conclusion, the observed variations in quantitative protein expression reflect the variety of molecular alterations across groups in mouse tissues rather than the effect of our label-free strategy.
Thus, the workflow for proteomic analysis was stable and reliable, and the high degree of quantitative accuracy offered by the label-free quantification (LFQ) technique allows us to investigate proteomic alteration in the pathological development of AD.

Analysis of Differentially Expressed Proteins
To characterize the differentially expressed in protein profiles, the Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) model was used to further optimize the population separation of different groups (Figure
Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis, a supervised identification method, was applied to strengthen an established separation between the control vs. model group (Figure
Subsequently, the permutation test was used to evaluate the possible overfitting of the OPLS-DA model.
The corresponding validation plot showed that all of the PLS-DA models built for duplicate samples at different groups were valid (Figures
Results obtained by OPLS-DA classification reveal a clear segregation of each group, indicating the significant changes in the expression of differentially expressed proteins in different groups.
The proteins with MC NC fold-change>1. 2 or <0.83 and p < 0.05 were chosen for further analysis.
A subset of 4,112 proteins were quantified (unique peptides ≥ 2), and 390 quantified proteins were identified as differential expression proteins.
Changes in protein levels were shown in Figure
And, we identified 211 proteins regulated by GPCRAC extracts (128 up-regulated and 83 down-regulated).
The overlaps of differentially expressed proteins between model vs. control and GPCRAC extracts vs. mod were 9 (Figure

The Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis Indicated the Potential Targets Mediated by GPCRAC Extracts in Treating AD
The integrated bioinformatics analysis based on proteomics was undertaken to discover the hub target proteins mediated by GPCRAC extracts in treating AD.
To begin, the GO and KEGG analysis were perform to explore the potential functions of the differentially expressed protein involved in the GPCRAC extracts-mediated treatment of AD.
The biological process of Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these differentially expressed proteins were primarily enriched in the positive regulation of autophagosome, presynaptic active zone membrane, ATPase activator activity, postsynaptic potential, postsynapse assembly, which is consistent with the fact that the pathology of AD correlates positively with synaptic function in hippocampal neurons (Figure
KEGG analysis showed relevant pathways with p < 0.05 (Figure
Spliceosome, RNA transport, Ribosome, Dopaminergic synapse, Long-term depression, Glutamatergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Apoptosis, and other highly enriched terms were found in the KEGG pathway analysis.
We discovered that most of the pathways play an important role in modulating the neurological function of the hippocampal, with the dopaminergic synaptic pathway being the best discriminant neural-related pathway, indicating that the dopaminergic pathway may be a necessary signaling pathway of target enrichment for the treatment of AD.
Furthermore, neuronal apoptosis is a well-known pathway implicated in the degenerative process of AD.
Next, to identify the core protein targets mediate by GPCRAC extracts in treating AD, volcano plot mapping was constructed to detect the proteins that were significantly regulated between control vs. Model (Figure
Specifically, PPP2CA (p63330), PRKACA (P05132), PPP3CC (Q80XK0), GSK3β (E9QAQ5) and BCL-2 (P10417) were confirmed a clearly altered protein profiles in model vs. control group, as well as these proteins were dramatically reversed following GPCRAC extract therapy.
To examine the specific change levels of these significantly altered   proteins that were genetically associated to AD, the 'protein expression level' represented by the ratio of individual samples compared to pooled samples (called "normalized protein abundance") was investigated.
As shown in Figure
Of these hub proteins, PPP2CA and PRKACA were down-regulated and GSK3β, PPP3CC and BCL-2 were down-regulated in AD group.
Following that, we exploit Pearson's correlation heatmap to interpret the 'signs'of interactions (ie, activation-inhibition relationships) between core differential proteins.
The correlation matrix data (Figure
We next sought to further attest the biological interpretations of hub proteins in the core network.
Briefly, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with Cytohubba plugins of Cytoscape was conducted to characterize hub proteins flow within core networks.
The top 35 nodes were first ranked using Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) method.
The pivot protein and its biological function were eventually discovered.
PPI visualization result suggest that several of the altered proteins were significantly connected with each other (enrichment value p < 0.005) and most of the hub differential proteins were primarily concentrated in the dopaminergic synapse and apoptosis signaling pathways, moreover, these pathways and some identified core proteins are implicated in AD pathogenesis (Figure
Eventually, PP2CA, PRKACA, PPP3CC, GSK3β associated with dopaminergic synapse and BCL-2 were selected as further analysis targets due to their closely relevance to neuronal damage.

Validation of the Protein Targets
The hub differentially expressed proteins and pathways of GPCRAC extracts in mediating AD were further verified by western blot and qPCR.
PPP2CA encoding the alpha (α)-isoform of catalytic subunit of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
PP2A and GSK3β are essential proteins involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the dopaminergic synaptic pathway
Additionally, PPP3CC and PRKACA are also important regulators of synaptic and neural plasticity, Figure
Representative western blotting images (Figures
In the hippocampus of mice exposed to scopolamine, reduced expression of PPP2CA, P-PKA, PPP3CC (Figures
Intriguingly, high dosages of GPCRAC extracts caused a considerable reversal in the expression levels of PPP2CA, PPP3CC, P-PKA, and P-GSK3β.
We also found lower levels of PPP2CA and PPP3CCmRNA expression in the scopolamine-treated model mice relative to the control animals (Figures
The apoptosis signaling system is important pathway in animal growth and tissue homeostasis
We discovered apparent alterations in the apoptosis-related protein BCL-2 using proteomics, therefore we wanted to learn more about the level of apoptosis in the hippocampus of mice given by scopolamine and the protective effects of GPCRAC extracts.
Furthermore, qPCR and Western blotting were used to investigate the anti-apoptotic efficacy of GPCRAC extracts in the hippocampus of mice subjected to scopolamine.
When compared with control animals, obviously higher protein expression levels of Bax (Figure
In the mouse brain, treatment with GPCRAC extracts drastically reduced the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 while increasing the expression of BCL-2.
These findings shown that GPCRAC extracts may dramatically regulate the expression of dopaminergic synapse associated proteins and apoptosis-related proteins in scopolamine-induced mice brain tissues, thereby treating AD.

DISCUSSION
The use of TCM as a potential therapeutic treatment for AD is an evolving field of investigation.
However, there is currently a lack of robust experimental proof and mechanism elaboration of TCM treatment.
A more effective therapy is being researched.
In this work, we first investigated the neuroprotective impact of GPCRAC extracts in reducing cognitive impairment evoked by scopolamine.
Scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, is frequently employed as a typical pharmacological model for producing cognitive impairment in animals
According to reports, scopolamine activity is predominantly associated to cholinergic depletion and apoptosis in the brain, both of which are hallmarks of the disease
Based on the scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, we studied the behavioral phenotype of AD model mice and discovered that GPCRAC extracts at high doses markedly alleviate AD-related cholinergic dysfunction, as demonstrated by increased Ach content and ChAT activity and decreased AchE activity.
Furthermore, behavioral tests revealed that scopolamine-triggered mice's hippocampus showed cognitive dysfunction in spatial learning and memory abilities.
Apart from the study of protective efficacy of GPCRAC extracts in improving cognitive impairment, acute oral toxicity and 13 weeks sub-acute toxicity studies were also conducted previously.
Safety evaluations on clinical observation, body weight, hematology, histopathological examination, ophthalmological examination did not show any adverse changes.
Together with previous work, the current study proven that the administration of GPCRAC extracts is both efficacious and safe.
Currently, even though several signaling pathways have emerged as a remarkably effector for AD treatment, there is still under investigating of the mediation of TCM to potential signaling pathway during AD pathological process.
The natural herbs are usually more difficult to be clarified in a specific pathway due to its' complex components especially for compound.
For further understand the mechanism of action of GPCRAC extracts alleviating AD, we employed in-depth quantitative proteomics to characterize the abnormal alterations of the hippocampal proteomes obtained from scopolamine-induced AD mice.
Our MSbased strategy identified 390 proteins that were shared by different groups.
By mapping the significantly regulated proteins, we identified five hub proteins: PPP2CA, GSK3β, PPP3CC, PRKACA, BCL-2.
Surprisingly, the proteins that were significantly altered were heavily enriched in dopaminergic synaptic signaling and apoptosis signaling pathway, respectively.
It is therefore possible that these hub proteins and related pathways may serve as possible mechanisms for the treatment of AD.
As one of the important signal transduction pathways in AD, the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway plays an important biological role in the process of neurotransmitter coordination, memory consolidation, neuronal synapse function
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), found at higher concentrations in brain, is a crucial phosphatase
And accept that the PP2A upregulation has been linked to a reduction in tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid formation
Recently evidence manifest that PP2A-mediated protein dephosphorylation is important for the homeostasis of synaptic plasticity
The GSK3β is a kinase that plays a role in the etiology of AD, and it performs biological functions after being dephosphorylated (p-GSK3β) by upstream proteins like PP2A
Also, GSK3β may be explored as a potential therapeutic target for AD through a mechanism that improves dopamine-dependent memory behaviors via modulating D2 receptor (D2R)-mediated signaling
Furthermore, the interaction between GSK3β and PP2A have been established, that PP2A, the main phosphatase could regulate GSK3β activity by removing phosphorylation at serine 9
Our proteomics research further adds to the evidence for a negative relationship between PP2A and GSK3β, which is critical for both basal synaptic transmission and long-term memory function.
In line with the results of proteomics, our in vivo experiments confirmed decreased expression of PP2A and increased phosphorylated GSK3β (p-GSK3β) in the hippocampus of the model group, which further supports the hypothesis that the balance of PP2A and GSK3β, which coordinate synaptic plasticity function, may be an important molecular mechanism in AD treatment.
Additionally, the cAMPmediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA, corresponds to the gene symbol PRKACA), a classical downstream target of dopaminergic synaptic pathway, play a vital role during the activation of presynaptic long-term plasticity
Phosphorylated PKA (P-PKA) may be a key target for GPCRAC extracts in the treatment of AD, according to our findings from proteomics and western blot analyses.
In addition, the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase (PPP3CC), which encodes a catalytic subunit of calcineurin (CaN; also named protein phosphatase 2B, PP2B)
It was proved that calcineurin could regulate glutamatergic transmission by indirectly influencing NMDARs that is crucial for neuronal communication
According to our proteomics findings, PPP3CC protein expression was up-regulated in the model group.
However, utilizing Western blotting and qPCR verification, a drop in PPP3CC protein and gene expression levels was found in the AD mice hippocampus, which was comparable to the earlier findings by Eastwood et al.
They also discovered lower levels of PPP3CCmRNA expression in hippocampal neurons under pathological conditions in vivo, suggesting that such reductions in expression may contribute to synaptic plasticity failure
Notably, our finding adds to the evidence that PPP3CC level decreases with the pathological progression of AD, and highlights the important role of PPP3CC that may present as a novel protein biomarker for AD.
However, the role of PPP3CC in AD has not been fully described previously, its mechanism to prevent nerve damage needs further investigation.
Overall, GPCRAC extracts may alleviate the cognitive impairment by regulation of the dopaminergic synapse signaling pathway (Figure
In addition to the dopaminergic synaptic pathway related proteins, the apoptosis pathway related protein BCL-2 shown significantly altered profiles.
Dopamine deficiency-mediated nerve cell apoptosis has been shown in studies to be an important pathological basis of neurodegenerative diseases
Cell survival or death cascades can be initiated by increasing the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2
The variation data shown here reveal that BCL-2 expression was considerably up-regulated in the scopolamine-treated group, which contradicts the results of the western blot.
This contradictory finding might be attribute to sample and processing differences.
Furthermore, Bax and capease3 concentrations also had large positive differences following GPCRAC extracts.
Taken together, these results support the conclusion that the neuroprotective effect of GPCRAC extracts treatment against AD may be through modulation of dopaminergic synapse cascade and apoptosis pathway extrapolated from bioinformatics analysis.
Collectively, our work provided novel insights into the molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity alterations in the pathological process of AD, and further confirmed the effectiveness of GPCRAC extracts as a natural herbal formula against progressive AD.
However, the detailed molecular mechanism mediated by GPCRAC extracts is primarily unknown and deserves further investigation.
In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that GPCRAC extracts treatment can effectively alleviate scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment.
The underlying mechanism may be related to the regulation of the dopaminergic synapse/apoptosis pathway.
