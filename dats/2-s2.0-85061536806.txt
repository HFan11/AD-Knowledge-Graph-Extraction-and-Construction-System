Korean Thistle (Cirsium japonicum var. maackii (Maxim.) Matsum.): A Potential Dietary Supplement against Diabetes and Alzheimer’s Disease
In the search for natural products having a dual inhibitory action on diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, this study investigated the activity of different parts of Korean thistle (Cirsium japonicum var.
maackii (Maxim.)
Matsum), and its fractional constituents by in vitro enzymatic and in silico molecular docking studies.
Cirsium maackii has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases.
The ethyl acetate and dichloromethane fractions of a leaf extract showed α-glucosidase and BACE1 inhibitory activity, respectively.
Furthermore, the isolated compound, luteolin, exhibited concentration-dependent non-competitive inhibition against both α-glucosidase and BACE1 (IC 50 = 51.27
± 1.23 and 13.75 ± 0.26 µM; K i value = 52.04 and 14.76 µM, respectively).
Moreover, docking studies showed that luteolin formed a strong hydrogen bond with the peripheral binding amino acid residues, and hydrophobic interactions with the α-glucosidase and BACE1 enzymes.
Therefore, Korean thistle may act as an important dietary supplement against diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, especially the leaves, because of the preponderance of the active component, luteolin, making Korean thistle a promising candidate for more detailed in vitro and in vivo studies.

Introduction
Diabetes is one of the most common metabolic disorder in today's world.
According to the International Diabetes Federation, 451 million people were affected with diabetes in 2017 and that number might increase to 693 million by the year 2045.
Moreover, it is estimated that nearly half of all the population are undiagnosed with diabetes, which could increase their risk of developing more complications
The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has several causes, which include heredity, gene mutations, and obesity
One way to decrease post-prandial hyperglycemia in T2D is to decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the food we consume.
This can be done by inhibiting the carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme α-glucosidase present in the epithelium of the small intestine.
α-Glucosidase, an exo-type carbohydrase enzyme widely distributed in microorganisms, plants, and animal tissues, catalyzes the liberation of α-glucose from the non-reducing end of the substrate
Inhibiting α-glucosidase decreases the rate of hydrolytic cleavage of oligosaccharide, and the process of carbohydrate digestion extends to the lower part of the small intestine, thus delaying the overall absorption rate of glucose into the blood
Likewise, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease characterized by a gradual decline in the cognition and behavior functions affecting day-to-day activities.
According to the Alzheimer's Association (2018), in the U.S. approximately 5.7 million people have AD.
The prevalence is increasing so rapidly that among every 10 people aged 65 or older, one is likely to have AD, and by the year 2050, the figure may increase to 88 million
Though different studies have been performed regarding the treatment of AD, the search for a treatment still continues.
Although the exact mechanism for AD remains unclear, several hypotheses have been proposed including the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) cascade, the tau hypothesis, the inflammation hypothesis, and the cholinergic and oxidative stress hypothesis
According to the amyloid hypothesis, the triggering of different pathologic cascades by amyloid β-protein (Aβ) may lead to neurodegeneration.
Aβ is formed from the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteases: namely, the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (β-secretase, BACE1) and γ-secretase
Proteases are among the prime therapeutic targets in AD.
Accumulation of Aβ within neural tissue may cause an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance, leading to the aggregation of Aβ and plaque formation, and eventually leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles
Thus, BACE1 inhibition is one of the potential targets for decreasing Aβ levels in AD.
Since T2D and AD are common in the elderly, they may be co-related.
Though the exact mechanisms are still unclear, causes of T2D such as insulin resistance
Also, deficiency of or resistance to insulin, impaired growth factor signaling, advanced glycation end products and their receptors, glucose toxicity, vascular injury, and cerebrovascular events are among the proposed mechanisms for a link between T2D and AD
Finding treatments for T2D and AD is an ongoing challenge, regardless of the efforts made.
Therefore, knowing the key enzymes associated with T2D and AD, α-glucosidase and BACE1 respectively, warrants a search for potentially safer natural inhibitors, giving motivation to explore biologically active compounds from a highly diverse group of plants.
Cirsium japonicum var.
maackii (Maxim.)
Matsum.
(synonym = C. maackii), or Korean thistle, is a perennial herbaceous medicinal plant belonging to the family Compositae.
Thistles are found throughout the world, however, the plant is widely distributed in the mountains and fields of Korea, China, and Japan.
It has been widely used as a traditional herbal medicine and is also listed in the Korean, Chinese and Japanese pharmacopoeias for treating hemorrhages, hypertension, hepatitis and ureteral disorders
Several medicinal benefits of C. maackii have been reported, which include anti-inflammatory
Additionally, it can be used to prevent diabetic complications and oxidative stress-related diseases through its inhibitory activity against advanced glycation end-product formation
However, its anti-diabetic and anti-AD activities have not been studied in detail.
Furthermore, dietary supplements can contribute to improved health.
In particular, plants with biological activities can have added benefits and can be consumed as food ingredients which can help in preventing those diseases.
Accordingly, we focused our study on the active components of C. maackii (Figure

The results of the glucosides were comparable to the positive control, acarbose (IC 50 = 267.27

In contrast, luteolin glucosides had weak inhibition against BACE1.
No inhibition of PTP1B was observed with the compounds at concentrations up to 400 µM.

Enzyme Kinetic Analysis of Compounds with α-Glucosidase and BACE1
To analyze the types of α-glucosidase and BACE1 inhibition exerted by the isolated compounds, enzyme kinetic analysis was performed using Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots (Table
Luteolin inhibited both the α-glucosidase and BACE1 enzymes in a non-competitive manner, as all the lines crossed the negative portion of the X-axis and the value of V max decreased, whereas -1/K m (horizontal axis intercept) was constant with increasing concentrations of inhibitors (Figures
Likewise, the increasing concentrations of substrate resulted in a family of lines that shared a common intercept on the left of the vertical axis and above the horizontal axis (Figure
These results in turn indicated that luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside caused a mixed type of inhibition towards α-glucosidase enzymes, involving a combination of partially competitive and pure non-competitive inhibition.
Moreover, in the case of luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (Figure
According to the Dixon plot, the K i values of the compound were 52.04, 271.80, and 251.20 µM for luteolin, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, respectively (Figure

Molecular Docking Simulation of α-Glucosidase and BACE1 Inhibition
To clarify how the bioactive compounds interacted with the active sites of the enzymes, molecular docking simulation was performed for the isolated compounds, namely luteolin, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside.
The binding energies of luteolin and its glucosides with the interacting residues, together with H-bond interactions, hydrophobic interacting residues, and numbers of H-bonds are listed in Tables
For α-glucosidase, the modelling results suggest that luteolin formed five H-bonds with Glu271, Ile272, Ser298, and Thr274, with a binding energy of -7.25 kcal/mol.
In addition, the α-glucosidase-luteolin complex was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Gly269, Arg270, Glu296, Asn259, Ile262, Val266, and Arg263 (Figure
Furthermore, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside had binding energies of -7.22 and -6.98 kcal/mol as a catalytic and an allosteric inhibitor, respectively, exhibiting mixed inhibition.
It formed seven H-bonds with the catalytic active site (His112, Asp215, Gln182, Tyr158, Glu411, Asp307, and Gln353) and six H-bonds with the allosteric site (Thr290, Ser298, Ile272, Arg270, and His295) (Figure
Likewise, the α-glucosidase-luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside complex had a binding energy of -7.21 kcal/mol, forming six H-bonds with Asp69, Arg442, Pro312, Asp242, and His280.
In addition, hydrophobic interactions were also observed between luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and the Phe159, Glu277, Asp352, Phe314, Phe303, Arg315, Leu313, Tyr158, Gln279, Val216, Asp215, and Phe178 residues (Figure
As shown in Table
Similarly, in the case of BACE1, luteolin formed three H-bonds with Ser299 and Gln304 along with the hydrophobic interacting residues Ser10, Gly11, Gln12, Gly13, Pro308, Val170, Thr232, Gly230, Ala335, Tyr14, Val336, Glu339, and Arg307 (Figure
In addition, the α-glucosidaseluteolin complex was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Gly269, Arg270, Glu296, Asn259, Ile262, Val266, and Arg263 (Figures

ADME properties such as human intestinal absorption (HIA), plasma protein binding, and cell permeability using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Caco-2 cells were evaluated using tool PreADMET (Table
Our results showed luteolin to have strong human intestinal absorption while its glucosides showed moderate absorption.
Likewise, luteolin strongly bound to plasma protein while its glucoside showed weak binding.
Furthermore, luteolin exhibited moderate permeability for both MDCK and Caco-2 cells.

Discussion
T2D and AD affect many people around the world.
Their prevalence is increasing so rapidly that a search for novel treatments is a major focus of research.
T2D and AD are considered age-related diseases, associated with a genetic predisposition and with similar pathological features in islet cells and the brain, respectively.
Though several studies have revealed that patients with T2D are at high risk of developing AD, the exact mechanism is ambiguous.
The common features of T2D and AD are insulin resistance, abnormal protein processing, oxidative stress, high cholesterol level, formation of advanced glycation end products, association with cardiovascular disease, blood vessel abnormalities, and the activation of inflammatory pathways
AD is manifested by the progressive loss of memory and decline in cognitive function, which are associated with the formation of Aβ protein, neurofibrillary tangles consisting of intracellular abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, with loss of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus and cortex regions
In T2D, the underlying mechanism includes insufficient insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and insulin resistance.
Initially, in response to the insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cells increase insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia.
However, when β-cell function decreases, insulin production is inadequate to overcome insulin resistance, causing the blood glucose level to rise, leading to T2D
In addition, to regulate glucose homeostasis, insulin has also been found to play a major role in regulating APP and its derivative Aβ protein associated with senile plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of AD
Though several remedies are available worldwide for the treatment of these diseases, the search is ongoing for new natural components as an alternative with fewer adverse effects.
And furthermore, dietary supplements can play a major role in the prevention of these diseases.
In our present study, a preliminary screening assay demonstrated that the aerial part and MeOH extract of C. maackii showed moderate inhibitory effects against α-glucosidase and BACE1, which prompted us to further investigate its different parts which were responsible for the activity.
Among the different parts tested (root, stem, leaves, and flower), the leaves showed a concentration-dependent inhibition against both α-glucosidase and BACE1 (Figure
However, the other parts did not exhibit prominent activity up to concentration of 1000 µg/mL for α-glucosidase.
Though the major active compounds isolated from C. maackii, i.e., luteolin and luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside were found in the root and stem, including a small amount in the flower as well
The reason might be the presence of the other compounds found in the root and stem that antagonize the activity of the active compounds.
At the same time, for BACE1, the leaves preceded by the flower part had the next highest activity level, with an inhibition of 52.11% at a concentration of 100 µg/mL, followed by the stem and root, which showed an intermediate level of inhibition against BACE1.
Furthermore, the high activity of the leaves due to their abundance of active constituents encourages us to find out which fractions to be responsible for their activity.
Therefore, the partitioning of the MeOH extract leads to the four solvent soluble fractions where the separation of the components was based on their polarity.
And among the four fractions, the EtOAc fraction showed the significant inhibitory activity towards α-glucosidase; while the CH 2 Cl 2 , followed by the EtOAc and the n-BuOH fractions, showed the most potent inhibition of BACE1.
The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction was found to have abundant amount of lupeol and lupeol acetate, and a previous study had shown that lupeol had potent BACE1 inhibitory activity
These results can explain the greater activity of the CH 2 Cl 2 fraction compared with that of EtOAc fraction and the other non-polar components.
Thus, this outcome minimizes the inconvenience of using the whole plant and confirms the usefulness of specific parts, i.e., the leaves of C. maackii, as potential dietary supplements for anti-T2D and anti-AD activity.
Furthermore, to find whether the isolated compounds have pro-oxidant and/or anti-oxidant effect or not, different procedures were followed (Table
As we can see in Figure
However, luteolin which possess the strong anti-oxidant activity possess low reducing power implying that its reducing power might not aid to its anti-oxidative activity.
Moreover, the greater will be its reducing power, the more is its absorbance value.
Nevertheless, the anti-oxidant activity of the compounds were similar to that of the study previously reported by Jung et al.
Likewise, among the isolated compounds luteolin, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, luteolin exhibited five-fold more potent inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase compared with the positive control, acarbose, while its glucosides, namely luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, had inhibitory effects similar to acarbose.
At the same time, against BACE1, luteolin exhibited stronger inhibitory activity compared to that of its glucosides.
These results highlight that the aglycone part of the flavonoid exhibited more inhibitory activity than its glucosides.
Nevertheless, no notable differences were observed between the 5th and 7th glucose-substituted luteolin.
Moreover, as we defined the effectiveness levels of the tested compounds, we aimed to evaluate the type of α-glucosidase and BACE1 inhibition by luteolin and its derivatives.
Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots were employed in order to investigate the inhibition kinetics.
As observed in Figures
A non-competitive inhibitor binds to an enzyme whether the substrate is at a low or high concentration
Likewise, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside is a mixed type inhibitor for α-glucosidase (Figure
In mixed type inhibition, as inhibitor and substrate can together be attached to the enzyme as inhibitor does not bound in the active site of the enzyme.
However, the substrate binding affinity can be declined when the inhibitor is present.
Additionally, luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside showed competitive inhibition towards α-glucosidase, which implies that luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside competes with the substrate for the active site (Figure
The K i values can also be a useful tool to compare the activity of the compounds, showing the binding affinity of the inhibitor to the enzyme (Table
These results suggest that luteolin exhibits the strongest binding affinity for the α-glucosidase and BACE1 enzymes.
Correspondingly, Ha et al.
Furthermore, Yan et al.
Moreover, Li et al.
Also, Tadera et al.
On the other hand, Kim et al.
In addition, luteolin isolated from Scutellaria lateriflora weakly inhibited sucrase
Moreover, Proença et al.'s study on the structure activity relationship of flavonoids against α-glucosidase showed that luteolin was a significant inhibitor, with an IC 50 value of 46 ± 6 µM
In addition, Xu et al.
Also, Choi et al. demonstrated that luteolin exerted non-competitive inhibition against BACE1, with an IC 50 of 5.0 × 10 -7 M and a K i value of 6.2 × 10 -5 M
Likewise, luteolin had anti-amnesic and neurovascular protective effects in the study performed by Liu et al.
Rezai-Zadeh et al. found that luteolin inhibited Aβ 1-40,42 generations from SweAPP N2a cells and Tg2576 mouse-derived primary neuronal cells
Furthermore, luteolin also reduced GSK-3α/β activation and altered PS1 processing/phosphorylation in SweAPP N2a cells.
Moreover, luteolin improved the cognitive function in Aβ 1-40 induced amnesic rats via antioxidant activation
Cheng et al. also reported the neuroprotective activity of luteolin through inhibition of the protein levels of JNK, ERK and p38 MAP kinases and caspase 3 activations
The discrepancies found in different studies may be due to the use of different enzyme and substrate concentrations, enzymes from different origins (yeast and rat intestinal source for α-glucosidase), and incubation times.
In the nutraceutical field, molecular docking techniques have been widely used to predict ligand-target binding affinity and to better understand the molecular basis of the biological responses.
Therefore, molecular docking simulations were performed with the bioactive compounds luteolin, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside isolated from the leaves of C. maackii.
The results are shown in Tables
For α-glucosidase, the docking result suggests that the 3 -OH group of luteolin formed hydrogen bonds with Ile272, Ser298, Thr274, and the 4 -OH group with Thr274.
Furthermore, the 7-OH group of luteolin formed a strong hydrogen bond with Glu271.
Also, the hydrophobic interactions with Gly269, Arg270, Glu296, Asn259, Ile262, Val266, and Arg263 aided in stabilizing the complex.
Additionally, the lower binding energy (-7.25 kcal/mol) of luteolin signifies the strong interactions with α-glucosidase.
Besides, the mixed inhibition exhibited by luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside was supported by the docking study, which showed its interaction with both the catalytic and allosteric residues.
For the catalytic inhibition of luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, different hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety formed strong H-bond interactions with Tyr158, Glu411, and Asp307, while the 7-OH formed an interaction with Gln353.
Likewise, the 3 -OH interacted with Gln182 and 4 -OH with Asp215 and His112.
And also, for allosteric inhibition, along with the glucose moiety, the 4 -OH group and the keto group at the 4th position formed hydrogen bonds with His295, along with the oxygen atom in the 1st position bonding with Ser298.
As well, luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside interacted with the active catalytic residues Asp69, Arg442, Pro312, Asp242, and His280.
Moreover, the hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety formed hydrogen bonds with Pro312 and Asp242.
Likewise, the oxygen atom linked with the glucose moiety formed a hydrogen bond with His280.
Also, 3 -OH formed an H-bond with Arg442 and Asp69, stabilizing the ligand-protein complex.
In the case of BACE1, the 3 and 4 -OH groups of luteolin at ring B formed H-bonds with Ser229, as did the 7-OH group with Gln304.
Additionally, Ser10, Gly11, Gln12, Gly13, Pro308, Val170, Thr232, Gly230, Ala335, Tyr14, Val336, Glu339, and Arg307 interactions supported the luteolin-BACE1 complex.
Consequently, the glucose OH moiety of luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside formed two H-bonds with Phe108.
In addition, the 7-OH group interacted with Asp228 and Asp32, and the 3 -OH and 4 -OH with Ile126.
Subsequently, seven H-bonds were formed by the OH group of the glucose moiety of luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside with Thr231, Asp228, Arg235, Thr329, Tyr198, and Lys224.
Moreover, the 3 -OH and 4 -OH groups also formed H-bonds with Phe108 and Lys107.
As shown in Tables
The reason could be the availability of the hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety of the glucosides, which could readily interact with the residues of different amino acids of α-glucosidase and BACE1.
Furthermore, though the glucoside molecules exhibited negative binding energies, energy might be required for the twisting of the molecules into the site, which would weaken their inhibition of the enzymes.
The lower energy of luteolin compared to its glucosides would lead to higher binding affinity of the compounds towards the enzymes.
Therefore, in silico studies provide additional insights into the underlying mechanism of action and binding mode of active compounds against metabolic key enzymes, supporting the experimental data.
Nevertheless, additional in vivo studies are needed to strengthened the in vitro results.
In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters of compounds isolated from C. maackii were estimated (Table
From the predicted data, we observed that the low molecular weight aglycone moiety i.e., luteolin exhibited the best pharmacokinetic properties, followed by luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside.
As we know, predicting human intestinal absorption (HIA) of drugs is very important in the design, optimization and selection of oral drugs.
HIA data are the sum of bioavailability and absorption evaluated from the ratio of excretion or cumulative excretion in urine, bile and feces
This can be evaluated as follows: HIA between 0% and 20% indicates poorly absorbed compounds, HIA between 20% and 70% as moderately absorbed compounds and HIA between 70% and 100% as well absorbed compounds
Luteolin, with its aglycone moiety, was well absorbed by human intestinal cells, while its glucosides were moderately absorbed.
Moreover, the drugs that are prescribed for different treatments can either bind reversibly to the plasma proteins and lipids, called plasma protein binding, which is useful in predicting the therapeutic dose in clinical trials.
The analysis of plasma protein binding was carried out based on the following criteria: chemicals strongly bound had a value more than 90% and weakly bound had a value less than 90%.
Our result showed luteolin to be strongly bound to the plasma proteins.
Furthermore, for the prediction of oral drug absorption, the MDCK cell and Caco-2 cell models have been recommended as a reliable in vitro model used in the drug selection process for measuring the intestinal absorption of drug candidates
The analysis can be done using the criteria of low permeability being less than 4 nm/s, middle permeability 4-70 nm/s, and high permeability more than 70 nm/s
In both cell models, luteolin exhibited moderate permeability compared to its glucosides, except for Caco-2 cells for which luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside showed comparable permeability.
Several studies have highlighted the metabolic fate of luteolin and its glucosides.
Shimoi et al.
Spencer et al. also found similar results
Additionally, Kure et al.
Also, Yasuda et al.
Interestingly, as flavonoid glucosides may serve as "pro-drugs" that subsequently release their respective aglycones in the gastrointestinal tract

Conclusions
Among the various parts of the C. maackii plant, the leaves demonstrated notable activity towards α-glucosidase and BACE1, which minimizes the inconvenience of using the whole plant or other, less active parts for treatment.
Moreover, the isolated compound luteolin showed concentration-dependent non-competitive inhibition against α-glucosidase and BACE1, which was in accordance with the molecular docking simulation studies.
At the same time, its glucosides, luteolin 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, both showed moderate activity.
Thus, Korean thistle (C.
maackii), which is widely used as a folk medicine, may act as an important dietary supplement in treating T2D and AD.
The leaves of this plant are of particular interest because of the concentration of the active compound luteolin along with its glucosides, which are promising candidates for more detailed in vitro and in vivo studies.
