Key Mechanisms and Potential Implications of Hericium erinaceus in NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Reactive Oxygen Species during Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the principal cause of dementia, and its incidence increases with age.
Altered antioxidant systems and inflammation have an important role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of Hericium erinaceus, a nutritional mushroom with important antioxidant effects, in a rat model of AD.
Animals were injected with 70 mg/Kg of AlCl3 daily for 6 weeks, and Hericium erinaceus was administered daily by gavage.
Before the experiment's end date, behavioral test training was performed.
At the end of the study, behavioral changes were assessed, and the animals were euthanized.
Brain tissues were harvested for further analysis.
AlCl3 mainly accumulates in the hippocampus, the principal region of the brain involved in memory functions and learning.
Hericium erinaceus administration reduced behavioral changes and hippocampal neuronal degeneration.
Additionally, it reduced phosphorylated Tau levels, aberrant APP overexpression, and β-amyloid accumulation.
Moreover, Hericium erinaceus decreased the pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory hippocampal alterations induced by AD.
In particular, it reduced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome components, usually activated by increased oxidative stress during AD.
Collectively, our results showed that Hericium erinaceus has protective effects on behavioral alteration and histological modification associated with AD due to the modulation of the oxidative and inflammatory pathways, as well as regulating cellular brain stress.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and neurodegenerative disorder.
It is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting millions of people worldwide
Different factors are considered AD inducers, such as genetics, age, co-morbidities, and educational level
In particular, the disease can be divided into two different forms: the familiar AD
One of the principal symptoms of the disease is memory loss, which gradually worsens over the years, dividing the pathology into three stages: mild, moderate, and severe.
In the beginning, memory loss is mild, but later, patients lose the ability to respond to their environment and carry on a conversation
Brain modifications induced by AD do not directly induce death but can induce complications, including trouble swallowing and immobility.
These complications, in turn, could lead to increased risks of pneumonia and malnutrition, resulting in death
It has been shown that oxidative stress and inflammation are tightly linked to neurodegenerative pathologies, including AD
The molecular pathways involve redox imbalance/oxidative stress, immune response, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation
Increased oxidative stress significantly aggravates the hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and the deposition of β-amyloid, two signs of AD
From a molecular point of view, AD is characterized by β-amyloid peptides derived from trans-amyloid precursor proteins, aggregated in amyloid plaques, and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein aggregated in neurofibrillary tangles.
These plagues induce synapse loss and neuronal death
Additionally, current studies have verified that redox homeostasis disruption and increased oxidative stress induce a cascade of events that include inflammasome activation
The inflammasome is a complex of many proteins, including a receptor for damage-or pathogen-derived molecular patterns (DAMPs or PAMPs) with PYD domaincontaining protein 3 (NLRP3), an adaptor with caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC), and pro-caspase-1, which is activated by ASC
Upon sensing DAMPs or PAMPs, the NLRP3 inflammasome recruits ASC and cleaved pro-caspase-1 in its active form, which in turn proteolytically activates pro-inflammatory cytokines
Modulation of cellular stress and inflammatory pathways through small redox and anti-inflammatory molecules could be a useful approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases.
Hericium erinaceus mycelia and fruit bodies contain many bioactive components.
For these compounds, several health-promoting properties have been described
In particular, they showed antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antifatigue, antihyperlipidemic, cardioprotective antisenescence, nephroprotective, and hepatoprotective effects
Additionally, previous studies showed the neuroprotective action of Hericium erinaceus mushroom
Moreover, it displayed antioxidant activities by increasing antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) and also reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, suggesting health-promoting effects as a result of ROS scavenging
Starting from these findings, the aim of this project was to evaluate the effect of Hericium erinaceus administration on AD, in particular, investigating its effects on oxidative stress-induced inflammasome activation during the pathology.

Materials and Methods

Animals
Male Wistar rats (age: six-eight weeks, weight: 250-280 g) (Envigo, Milan, Italy) were used.
Animals were housed in a controlled environment and provided with standard rodent chow (Envigo, Teklad Rodent Diet T.2018.12)
and water.
The University of Messina Review Board for Animal Care (OPBA) approved the study.
All animal experiments agreed with the new Italian regulations (D.Lgs 2014/26), EU regulations (EU Directive 2010/63), and the ARRIVE guidelines.

Experimental Protocol
Aluminum (AlCl 3 ) is commonly used as an AD model
AlCl 3 was intraperitoneally injected daily at the dose of 70 mg/Kg for six consecutive weeks

Experimental Groups
Rats were randomly assigned to the following groups (n = 30 for each group):

•
Control: rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline; • Control + Hericium erinaceus: rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline, and Hericium erinaceus (200 mg/kg) was administered daily orally by gavage; • AD group: rats were injected intraperitoneally with AlCl 3 as already described;
• AD group + Hericium erinaceus: rats were injected intraperitoneally with AlCl 3 as already described, and Hericium erinaceus (200 mg/kg) was administered daily orally by gavage.
Hericium erinaceus biomass, including mycelium and primordia, generously provided by Mycology Research Laboratories Ltd. (MRL, Luton, UK), as a commercially available product, was used for investigations.
The dose of Hericium erinaceus was based on previous experiments
Before the experiment's end date, behavioral test training was performed.
At the end of the study, behavioral changes were assessed, and the animals were euthanized.
Brain tissues were harvested for further analysis.

Behavioral Assessment 2.4.1. Morris Water Maze (MWM)
The MWM test was employed to evaluate spatial learning and memory consolidation
The percentage of distance covered and the time spent in the target quadrant were recorded.

Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)
The EPM test was employed to evaluate memory-related processes.
The behavioral test was performed as already described

Novel Object Recognition (NOR)
The NOR test was employed to evaluate the changes in cognitive function induced by AD.
The Behavioral test was performed as already described
The time spent exploring the novel object was reported according to the recognition index (RI).
It was calculated by dividing the time spent investigating the novel object (TN) by the time spent exploring TN and a familiar object (TF), [RI = TN/(TN + TF)].
An RI percentage higher than 50% indicates more time spent exploring the TN; an RI percentage lower than 50% indicates more time spent exploring the TF.

Histological Analysis
Brain samples were collected, processed, and embedded in paraffin
Sections of 7 µm in thickness were cut into longitudinal sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Sections were evaluated by an experienced histopathologist using a Leica DM6 microscope (Leica Microsystems SpA, Milan, Italy) equipped with a motorized stage and associated with Leica LAS X Navigator software (Leica Microsystems SpA, Milan, Italy).
The necrosis rates of the necrotic neurons out of the total neurons were manually counted along the ipsilateral of the hippocampal CA1 region

Western Blot Analysis
Western blots were performed on the hippocampus as previously described
Specific primary antibodies, i.e., anti-IkB-α (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-1643), anti-NF-kB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8008), anti-Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-36594), anti-NOS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7271), anti-p-Tau (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32275), or anti-APP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32277), anti-NLRP3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-ASC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-271054), or anti-Caspase-1 (Cell Signaling Technology), were mixed in a 5% w/v nonfat dried milk solution and were incubated at 4 • C overnight.
Afterward, blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated bovine anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody or a peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were also incubated with an antibody against βactin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) to verify that the amounts of protein were equal.
Signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system reagent (Super-Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce)
The relative expression of the protein bands was quantified by densitometry with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS software and standardized to β-actin levels
Images of blot signals were imported to an analysis software (Image Quant TL, v2003).

Discussion
Despite the increasing number of studies on AD, the molecular mechanisms driving the pathology are mostly elusive, and the interventions for treating or preventing it are limited and unsuccessful.
In this paper, we evaluated the effects of Hericium erinaceus administration on increased reactive oxygen species and NLRP3 inflammasome activation that characterize AD.
Several papers showed the importance of oxidative stress in the progression and development of the pathology.
Recent studies have shown that AD is characterized by a latent period before features emerge and diagnosis is made.
In particular, onset of AD is preceded by a mild cognitive impairment phase in which there is a small increase in β-amyloid accumulation but a significant oxidative imbalance, as compared with the healthy controls
Many studies suggest that ROS overproduction induces neuronal death and related pathological changes during AD
Additionally, in both in vitro and in vivo studies and in post-mortem patient brain tissues, the key role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in β-amyloid plaque deposition and p-Tau and APP overexpression has been shown
Elevated APP levels are responsible for reducing hippocampal neurogenesis and the related impaired cognitive activity
Some evidence, in fact, showed that memory consolidation and learning and cognitive function are related to hippocampal plasticity
AlCl3 neurotoxicity in animals has been clearly established and shown to be involved in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
It promotes the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein plaques by aggregating Tau proteins in the brain.
AlCl3 has also been implicated in aging-related changes and neurodegeneration.
It is reported that AlCl3 toxicity is due to the increased ROS release that causes oxidative damage in the hippocampus
AlCl3 can induce neurotoxicity via free radical production
Aluminum ions have a strong affinity for bio-membranes; it is capable of increasing the cellular oxidative milieu by potentiating the pro-oxidant properties of transition metals
Its exposure is also associated with impairment of mitochondrial functions in vitro
Moreover, AlCl3 toxicity was found to be associated with the reduced axonal length and dendritic branches in the hippocampus
Administration of AlCl3 predominantly accumulates in the hippocampus, and this region is known to be particularly susceptible to AD and has an important role in learning and memory functions
For these reasons, histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses were conducted on hippocampal tissue.
Hericium erinaceus showed multiple positive effects on AD progression, reducing Tau over-phosphorylation, APP levels, and β-amyloid accumulation.
From a behavioral point of view, it strongly reduced cognitive impairments.
Histologically, it reduced the persistent hippocampal neuron loss and degeneration characteristics of AD.
These behavioral and histological effects could be ascribed to the molecular properties of Hericium erinaceus.
It activated the cellular defenses against the detrimental ROS effects by increasing the Nrf2 transcription factor and the related target genes
Nrf2 is responsible for genes that encode proteins operating as endogenous antioxidant enzymes, redox balancing factors, and stress-response proteins
In particular, it activated the phase II detoxifying enzymes, including Catalase, SOD, and GSH.
Additionally, Hericium erinaceus reduced nitrite levels, lipid peroxidation, and ROS levels increased by AD
These inhibitory effects on oxidative stress led to the reduction in NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization and activity.
It has already been demonstrated that antioxidants can reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation
In this paper, we have shown an important downregulation of the inflammasome complex.
In particular, there is a reduced expression of the complex components NLRP3 and ASC, and Caspase-1 reduced the conversion of the pro-inflammatory interleukins pro-IL1β and pro-IL18 into their active forms.
Due to this modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, our results showed a reduction in the pro-inflammatory macroenvironment.
In particular, we also showed important anti-inflammatory activities by decreasing the activation of the NF-kB pathway.
NF-kB is one of the most important pro-inflammatory transcription factors
During inflammation, the inhibitor is degraded, and NF-kB translocases into the nucleus to encode pro-inflammatory proteins
Our results showed restored cytoplasmic levels of IkB-α and reduced NF-kB nuclear expression of the related target pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL6, and iNOS.

Conclusions
Thus, by decreasing oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, Hericium erinaceus manages the characteristics of AD: behavioral changes, phosphorylated Tau levels, and aberrant APP overexpression, β-amyloid accumulation, and neuronal degeneration.
