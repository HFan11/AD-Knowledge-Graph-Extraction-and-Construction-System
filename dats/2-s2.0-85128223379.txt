Failure of DNA double-strand break repair by tau mediates Alzheimer’s disease pathology in vitro
DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the most severe form of DNA damage and accumulates with age, in which cytoskeletal proteins are polymerized to repair DSB in dividing cells.
Since tau is a microtubule-associated protein, we investigate whether DSB is involved in tau pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
First, immunohistochemistry reveals the frequent coexistence of DSB and phosphorylated tau in the cortex of AD patients.
In vitro studies using primary mouse cortical neurons show that non-p-tau accumulates perinuclearly together with the tubulin after DSB induction with etoposide, followed by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau.
Moreover, the knockdown of endogenous tau exacerbates DSB in neurons, suggesting the protective role of tau on DNA repair.
Interestingly, synergistic exposure of neurons to microtubule disassembly and the DSB strikingly augments aberrant p-tau aggregation and apoptosis.
These data suggest that DSB plays a pivotal role in AD-tau pathology and that the failure of DSB repair leads to tauopathy.

NA damage is an unavoidable and relentless event for all cells, threatening the maintenance of homeostasis for cell survival.
DNA repair failure is a severe phenomenon for neurons since they lack cell division
Moreover, DNA damage accumulates in addition to the aging process, and failure of DNA repair affects transcription and translation, resulting in breakdowns for genomic integrity
DNA damage occurs in response to various endogenous biological activities in cells
In proliferating cells, the failure of DNA repair leads to cell cycle arrest and cell death
In a study involving a mouse brain, DSB occurred in multiple brain regions, most abundantly in the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, in which the repair occurred within 24 hours
In another study, while focusing on a single neuron of a live zebrafish, the number of DSBs increased while the zebrafish was awake, and they decreased when they were sleeping; this phenomenon is associated with chromosome dynamics
Chromosome movement in the cell are driven by cytoplasmic microtubules
In eukaryotes, when DNA damage occurs, cytoplasmic microtubules above the nuclear membrane invade the nucleus, transform the nucleus to promote DNA mobility-dependent repair by dynein and send in DNA repair proteins.
Alternatively, microtubules act as intranuclear transporter of damaged DNA to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)
Thus, DNA damage repair and chromosome movement are closely related, while cytoskeleton proteins are responsible for this system.
Although evidence indicates that DNA damage is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases
The common pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases is the collection of pathogenic proteins, such as amyloid β (Aβ) and microtubule-associated protein (MAPT; tau) in AD, α-synuclein in Parkinson's Disease (PD), TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Notably, these proteins play important roles in nuclear functions.
For example, α-synuclein localizes in the nucleus and is involved in the DSB repair system
TDP-43 and FUS, RNA-binding proteins, contribute to the stability of mRNA and the DNA repair
Moreover, recent reports demonstrate that DSB accumulates in the hippocampus in the brains of AD patients and AD model mice
Aβ-induced oxidative stress or activation of Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) induces DSB
Tau protein is almost exclusively localized to the axon, however, it is also reported to localize in the nucleus to stabilize DNA
Furthermore, there are reports which suggest that p-tau re-locates to the nuclear membrane, interacts with the NPC, and inhibits nucleus-cytosol transports in tau transgenic mice and AD brain
In addition, autosomal dominant missense as well as splicing mutation in MAPT cause microtubule mediated deformation of the nucleus in inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
Several studies have reported the involvement of DSB in tau pathology.
DNA-repair deficient mouse showed the p-tau pathology in the hippocampus and cotex
Moreover, DNA base excision repair activity by oxidative DNA damage was enhanced in the hippocampus of 6month-old THY-Tau22 mice, a mouse model of tauopathy
However, it is unclear the mechanism for the correlation of DSB and tau pathology or NFT formation.
Since aging is the apparent risk factor for AD development, and it is also implicated in DSB, we investigated whether DNA damage is linked to tau pathology using the immunohistochemistry of AD brains and cell culture analysis.
We found that DSB plays a pivotal role in AD-tau pathology and that the failure of DSB repair is linked to tauopathy.

Results

AD brains contain abundant DSB co-localizes with p-tau in neurons.
Several studies have reported that DSB is augmented in AD brains
First, we analyzed hippocampal slices of human AD brain and non-neurodegenerative disease control brain (Table
Consistent with previous reports
To examine the regional difference of DSB vulnerability in neurons, we performed double staining for γH2Ax and MAP2 or NeuN in the temporal lobe cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus.
In the AD brain, we observed a large number of MAP2 and NeuN-positive neurons co-localizing with γH2Ax in the entorhinal cortex and temporal lobe cortex (Fig.
In contrast, most neurons were γH2Ax-negative in the hippocampus (Supplemental Fig.
We also performed immunofluorescence analysis to identify types of cells vulnerable to DSB damage, using antibodies against NeuN, GFAP, Iba-1, ZO-1, and olig2 as markers for neurons, astrocytes microglia, endothelial cells, and oligodendrocytes, respectively.
In the entorhinal cortex and temporal lobe cortex, NeuN -positive neurons co-localized with γH2Ax similar to the result of MAP2 stains (Supplemental Fig.
In the hippocampus, γH2Ax staining was frequently colocalized with GFAP in AD (Supplemental Fig.
In the cerebral white matter of the temporal lobe, γH2Ax-positive cells were similarly detected in both AD and the control (Fig.
Microglia and endothelial cells showed almost no co-localization with γH2Ax (Supplemental Fig.
Moreover, double immunohistochemistry using AT8 (phosphorylated at S202/T205) and γH2Ax antibodies revealed that cortical cells containing phosphorylated tau (p-tau) occasionally displayed DSB in AD, where p-tau-positive cells were scarce in control (Fig.
Notably, co-localization of p-tau and DSB was quite rare in the hippocampus of AD brains (Fig.
DSB induces tau accumulation in the nuclear fraction.
Previous reports demonstrate that the DNA moves to the nuclear pores and interacts with the inner nuclear membrane proteins for DNA repair upon severe DSB.
Dissociation of damaged DNAs from the unimpaired DNA prevents aberrant recombination
Hence, we examined whether subcellular localization of tau is altered in neurons when DSB occurs using etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor.
Primary mouse cortical neurons (DIV 7) were treated using 50 μM etoposide for 0, 0.5, 3, 6, and 24 h, and the cell lysates were separated into the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions for Western blotting.
The γH2Ax levels were highest at 3 h after treatment and decreased subsequently (Fig.
In addition, the comet assay to quantify DSB levels showed that the damage was highest after 3 h of etoposide exposure, which is consistent with the result of WB (Fig.
From the preliminary lethality evaluation, 24 h of exposure to 50 μM etoposide reduced cell viability by about 60 % (Supplemental Fig.
Active Caspase3 was detected at 6 and 24 h after treatment in cytoplasm fraction (Fig.
In the cytoplasm, p-tau (AT8) gradually elevated at 6, and 24 h after treatment, wheres non-p-tau (Tau-1; dephosphorylated at S195/S198/S199/S202) levels were the highest at 6 h and declined at 24 h after DSB (Fig.
In the nuclear fraction, p-tau and non-p-tau showed a similar expression profile, which increased at 6 h after treatment (Fig.
This result was similar to a previous study that etoposide treatment increased total tau in the nucleus
On the contrary, DSB induction by ultraviolet (UV) exposure for 5-and 10-mins increased tau species, including total, non-phosphorylated, and phosphorylated tau in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions at 5 mins (Supplemental Fig.
These results indicate that DSB induces nuclear accumulation of non-p-tau, which subsequently increases p-tau.
UV exposure might accelerate tau accumulation due to the disproportionate effect.
Since primary mouse cortical neurons cultured for 14 days also showed similar results that nonp-tau and p-tau in the nuclear fraction increased in an etoposide concentration-dependent manner (Supplemental Fig.
We decided to use primary neurons of DIV 7 for the following experiments.
Cytosolic non-p-tau accumulates around the nucleus in neurons after DSB induction.
Thereafter, we performed immunocytochemical analysis to determine the subcellular location around the nuclei, where non-p-tau had accumulated by DSB induction.
After treatment with 50 μM etoposide for 6 h., the primary mouse cortical neurons (DIV 7) were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using Tau-1 and anti-γH2Ax antibodies.
γH2Ax-positive neurons were significantly increased by etoposide exposure, in which the population of γH2Ax and Tau1double-positive neurons was markedly highest (Fig.
Intriguingly, the etoposide treatment increased Tau-1 staining in the cytosol, particularly surrounding the nucleus as shown in XZ and 3D images (Fig.
Furthermore, etoposide treatment also significantly augmented Tau1 intensity in the DAPI area (Fig.
These results suggest the possibility that DSB recruits tau to the nuclear periphery.
We next performed immunoelectron microscopy to analyze the precise localization of non-p-tau after 6 h of etoposide treatment.
In non-treated neurons, Tau-1 staining showed scattered distribution, predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig.
On the contrary, at 6 h after 50 μM etoposide treatment, the gold particles for tau-1 were observed chiefly around the nuclear membrane (Fig.
To confirm the accumulation of non-p-tau close to the nuclear membrane by DSB induction, we performed a proximal ligation assay (PLA) probe for non-p-tau and nuclear membrane in primary mouse cortical neurons (Supplemental Fig.
Moreover, treatment of 50 μM etoposide for 6 h also increased PLA foci for Tau1 and LaminB, nuclear membrane protein on the nucleus (Supplemental Figs.
These results indicate that DSB may recruit non-p-tau to the perinuclear membrane.
DSB-induced perinuclear p-tau is neurotoxic.
Western blotting (WB) showed that p-tau might increase in the cytoplasm for 24 h after etoposide exposure (Fig.
Therefore, we investigated the precise subcellular location of p-tau after DSB induction using confocal and immunoelectron microscopes.
XZ images of the confocal immunofluorescent analysis showed that p-tau immunoreactivity (AT8) was enhanced around the nuclei at 24 h after 50 μM etoposide exposure (Fig.
Quantitative analysis also determined that AT8 immunofluorescent intensity in the DAPI area increased at 24 h after etoposide exposure (Fig.
Immunoelectron microscope showed that the gold particles for AT8 scattered in the cytosol, while etoposide treatment altered the AT8 distribution closer to the nuclear membrane (Fig.
Moreover, UV exposure for 10 mins also increased PLA foci for PHF-tau (AT100; pThr212/ Ser214) and heterochomatin (Supplemental Fig.

DSB promotes the interaction between non-p-tau and tubulin.
Previous reports demonstrated that non-p-tau accelerates the polymerization of microtubules
Since the accumulation of non-p-tau in the perinuclear region was most prominent at 6 h after DSB induction (Fig.
Hence, we investigated the effect of DSB on tubulin and non-p-tau assembly.
Primary mouse cortical neurons (DIV 7) were exposed to 50 μM etoposide for 0, 0.5, 3, 6, and 24 h., and thereafter, they were analyzed by PLA probe assay.
Results show that the number of PLA signals (red foci) increased the most at 6 h after the etoposide treatment (Supplemental Fig.
Moreover, co-PLA foci were exclusively adjacent to DAPI signals, and they were most noticeable at 6 h (Fig.
PLA signals for p-tau and tubulin were almost undetectable (Supplemental Fig.
These results indicate that DSB promotes the interaction between tubulin and non-p-tau around nuclei, enhancing the microtubule assembly, and resulting in the accumulation of non-p-tau around the nucleus.
Tau knockdown by shRNA increases γH2A in the early stage of DSB induction.
Henceforth, to investigate the effect of tau on DSB and repair, we performed knockdown for endogenous mouse tau by lentivirus vector-mediated shRNA for primary mouse cortical neurons.
Endogenous mouse tau expression levels effectively reduced about ~60% of tau protein compared to control shRNA (Fig.
We checked the intensity of γH2Ax on WB by comparing the control and mouse tau shRNA.
At the instance when shRNA-treated primary mouse cortical neurons were exposed to etoposide for 30 min, tauknockdown increased γH2Ax 2-fold higher than control shRNA without altering the level of active caspase-3 (Fig.
We studied the more prolonged effect of 30 min DSB induction on the delayed cell survival, in which neurons after replacement with normal medium were cultured for subsequent 24 h.
Fascinatingly, downregulation of tau reduced γH2Ax by ~60% compared to the control shRNA at 24 h (Supplemental Fig.
Similar results were obtained for other shRNA clones (Supplemental Fig.
These results indicate that tau may contribute to DSB repair by accompanying tubulin and the recruitment to the perinucleus in the early phase.
DSB and microtubule disassembly synergistically induced aberrant p-tau aggregates and caspase activation.
DSB induction enhanced interaction between non-p-tau and tubulin, implying that the enhancement of tubulin polymerization by tau may be involved in DSB repair.
Since the tau phosphorylation is tightly linked to microtubule disassembly, we investigated the effect of the inhibition of microtubule polymerization under DSB conditions by examining the distribution of p-tau, using microtubule polymerization inhibitor, 2(-2,6Diisopropylphenyl)-5hydroxy-1H-isoindole-1,3-dione (5HPP-33).
After pretreatment with 2.5 μM 5HPP-33 for 30 mins, primary mouse cortical neurons were exposed to 50 μM etoposide for 24 h.
It was confirmed by PLA probe assay using α-tubulin and β-tubulin antibody verified microtubule polymerization and disassembly between αtubulin and β-tubulin by 5HPP-33, but not by DMSO treatment (Supplemental Fig.
Interestingly, the exposure to both etoposide and 5HPP-33 induced an excessive and aberrant cytosolic accumulation of p-tau throughout the neurons, mimicking an NFT (Fig.
Treatment with bleomycin, which induces DSB by a different mechanism of action, yielded the same results (Supplemental Fig.
Moreover, WB analysis showed that the combination of etoposide and 5HPP-33 enhanced the levels of γH2Ax and cleaved-caspase3 in detergent-soluble fraction (Fig.
Based on these results, inhibition of microtubule polymerization under DSB might lead to the formation of NFTs and neurotoxicity.

Discussion
We have demonstrated evidence that corroborates the involvement of DSB in tauopathy in AD using human brain and in vitro experiments.
Although DSBs were observed in neurons in the postmortem AD brain, glial cells, especially oligodendrocytes, surprisingly showed more prominent DSB signals (Fig.
This is likely due to the fact that neuronal DSB might be underestimated on account of increased neuronal death in the AD brain.
On the other hand, most neurons cannot divide, but glial cells can
Therefore, glial cells are capable of precise repair by homologous recombination when DSB occurs.
In addition, it is reported that DSB repair in neuron occurs faster than in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), possibly due to the higher DNAdependent protein kinase activity (DNA-PK), which is the repair protein in the NHEJ repair system
Neurons may have more specialized repair systems for DSB repair than glial cells.
In dividing cells, the repair of DNA damage is tightly associated with the cell cycle, in which the DNA damage response activates cell cycle checkpoints to prevent replicating mis-genetic information
Contrastingly, it has been reported that nondividing postmitotic neurons in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, undergo a re-entry into the cell cycle occurred for DNA repair
Moreover, data from in situ PLA probe and electron microscope revealed that DSB induction recruited non-p-tau to the nuclear membrane together with the augmentation of tau-tubulin interaction (Figs.
These findings indicate that cytoskeletal rearrangement might occur after DSB induction, which drives tau in microtubule assembly.
Indeed, several reports demonstrate that p-tau is present on a mitotic spindle, which contains microtubules, during cell division of the spermatogenesis in mouse testes
Consequently, the increase of non-p-tau and p-tau around the nuclear envelope by DSB induction might relate to microtubule reassembly for the neuronal cell cycle re-entry.
Giorgio U. et al. also examined the phosphorylation state of nuclear tau in detail in proliferating pluripotent neuronal C17.2 and neuroblastoma SY5Y cells and showed an increase in pT181, pT212, and S404
DSB by etoposide decreased p-tau and increased non-p-tau, resulting in tau translocation into the nucleus.
Conversely, we showed that DSB induction increases nuclear p-tau (AT8).
The apparent discrepancy might be derived from the phosphorylation sites since we used the AT8 antibody.
Otherwise, our results that DSB induction increases nuclear nonp-tau agree with theirs.
We presented that DSB sequentially promoted the accumulation of non-p-tau around the nuclear membrane, followed by the accumulation of p-tau (Figs.
Oligomeric toxic tau species are also increased (Fig.
Interestingly, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), one of the kinases responsible for tau phosphorylation, is activated by DNA damage and phosphorylates ATM as the first step in the repair signal
It has been repoted that Tau is also phosphorylated by Chk1 and 2, DNA damage-activated Checkpoint kinase
DSB may initially increase non-p-tau for DNA repair, but later result in the formation of cytotoxic tau species such as oligomeric tau or NFT through the activation of tau-phosphorylatd enzaymes such as CDK5, Chk1, Chk2, GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) or p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase).
Thus, further investigation regarding the role of tau-phoshorylated enzymes in DSB induction in tauopathy will contribute to understanding AD.
Based on the results of the tau knockdown study, it is strongly suggested that tau may have a role in promoting DSB repair with tubulin polymerization in the early stages of DSB development (Fig.
DSB was exacerbated in cultured neurons in an etoposide-free nutrient medium for 24 h after 30 mins etoposide treatment.
However, the knockdown of endogenous tau rescues the neuron from DSB-related toxicity (Supplemental Fig.
Interestingly, pharmacological depolymerization of tubulin and DSB induction led to accumulation of p-tau in the neuron, especially in the insoluble fraction (Fig.
Considering the possibility that aging is a risk factor for sustained DSB, tau, by phosphorylation and microtubule disassembly, may exert a negative impact on DSB repair and neuronal survival.
In summary, neurons are physiologically exposed to various crises, such as aging, oxidative stress, genetic mutation, and excitotoxicity, all of which cause DNA damage.
Under normal conditions, when DNA damage occurs, cytoskeletal proteins, such as microtubules, polymerize to execute DNA repair, and they might form a link with the nuclear membrane for the repair.
Tau may well be involved in the rearrangement of microtubules to assist this process.
However, the excessive DNA damage may cause accumulation of p-tau in the soma and may disassemble microtubules, which may exacerbate DNA damage and lead to neuronal cell death (Fig.
Although we did not present the molecular basis of non-p-tau in the DNA repair, our solid evidence using human and in vitro studies indicate the tight relationship between DNA damage and tau cytopathology.

Fig. 8
Fig. 8 Hypothetical model of neuronal death and DNA damage repair from the perspective of the relationship between tau and microtubule polymerization.
Upon DNA damage, non-p-tau (blue) binds to microtubules at the physiological level, which promotes microtubule (MT) polymerization and induces accumulation around the perinuclear membrane to support DNA damage repair (Right: normal condition).
When DNA damage reaches an excessive level, tau phosphorylation is enhanced and microtubule depolymerization occurs.
Accumulation of p-tau (orange) around the perinuclear membrane suppress the movement of damaged chromosomes or inhibits the recruitment of DNA damage repair factors into the nucleus by inhibiting nuclear cytoplasmic transport.
Subsequently, insolubule p-tau accumulates in the cytoplasm and axons, leading to further microtubule polymerization and neuron death (left: pathological condition).
