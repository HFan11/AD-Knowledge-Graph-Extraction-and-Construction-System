The Protective A673T mutation of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid beta peptides, and neuro brillary tangles consisted of intracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
Most of the mutations in key genes that code for amyloid precursor protein can lead to signi cant accumulation of these peptides in the brain and cause Alzheimer's Disease.
Moreover, Some point mutations in amyloid precursor protein can cause familial Alzheimer's Disease, such as Swedish mutation and A673V mutation.
However, recent studies have found that the A673T mutation in amyloid precursor protein gene can protect against Alzheimer's Disease, even it is located next to the Swedish mutation and at the same site as A673V mutation, which are pathogenic.
It makes us curious about the protective A673T mutation.
Here, we summarize the most recent insights of A673T mutation, focus on their roles in protective mechanisms against Alzheimer's Disease, and discuss their involvement in future treatment.

Introduction
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing memory loss, cognitive decline and dementia to millions of elderly individuals worldwide
The two pathological hallmarks of AD are toxic plaque accumulates of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, and neuro brillary tangles consisted of intracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex
The key role for Aβ peptides in the pathophysiology of AD based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis in 1992 was the initiating step of AD pathogenesis, leading to subsequent Tau deposition, synaptic damage, neuronal death and cognitive decline
Current researches still strongly support this original hypothesis, although its mechanism may be less direct than originally expected and requires further clarity through ongoing studies
Aβ peptides are generated via amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21 (21q21.2-3),
catalysed by the sequential cleavage of β-and γ-secretases
β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), the main β-secretase, cleaves APP between Met671 and Asp672, resulting in the generation of a soluble APP-β ectodomain (sAPPβ) and its complementary membraneretained carboxy-terminal counterpart of 99 amino acids termed C99 or β-CTF.
Subsequently, γ-secretase cleaves the resulting carboxy-terminal fragment at promiscuous sites to generate APP intracellular domain (AICD) and Aβ peptides with different C termini, including preference formations of Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 , and other minor species
Aβ 1-42 is more prone to Aβ aggregation and promotes bril formation, triggering neurotoxic effects
While BACE-1 can also cleave APP at β'-site, between Thy681 and Gln682, yielding Aβ 11-xx .
Aβ 11-42 and Aβ 11-40 generated by this amyloidolytic cleavage showed less toxicity than Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 , especially for the neurotoxicity of Aβ 11-42
At present, approximately 30 coding mutations in the APP gene have been found to be association with AD
Most of them are pathogenic for AD, because they can either promote Aβ accumulation or speci cally augment the Aβ 42 / Aβ 40 ratio formation, such as Swedish mutation and A673V mutation
In contrast, a rare APP coding mutation A673T (rs63750847) identi ed in the Icelandic population was linked to a protection against late-onset AD .
After the discovery of this protective mutation in 2012, Icelandic mutation A673T have engaged more and more researchers' attention
Here, we summarize the most recent insights of A673T, focus on population frequencies as well as protective mechanisms, and discuss their involvement in future treatment for AD.

Population frequencies of the APP A673T mutation
Protective A673T mutation was rst found in a set of whole-genome sequence data obtained from 1,795 Icelanders in 2012.
In addition to the protection against AD, this large Icelandic study also revealed that the 3,673 A673T carriers without Alzheimer's disease had a higher cognitive level than 41 noncarriers based on the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS), which suggested that the effect of A673T mutation may beyond the boundaries of the protection against AD
Moreover, neuropathologic analysis of the A673T mutation carrier aged 104.8 years in another study showed little beta-amyloid pathology and the score of Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) was 0. Immunohistochemistry in brain tissue showed no typical senile plaques in the temporal cortex of the carrier's left cerebral hemisphere, and no accumulation of intracortical β-amyloid in the arterial wall, while some meningeal arteries in the parietal cortex were positive for β-amyloid.
And the temporal gyrus phosphorylation (p)-Tau immunohistochemistry showed age-related cytoplasmic neuro brillar tangles and a considerable number of neurophil threads
A673T mutation carrier only have little beta-amyloid pathology and age-related cytoplasmic neuro brillary tangles and a large number of neuro laments
In addition, studies had shown that the plasma Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels of the A673T mutation healthy carrier were reduced by an average of 28% compared to the controls
To determine the frequency of the protective A673T mutation, many countries began to carry out large sample studies (Fig.
In Northern Europe, similar to Icelanders, A673T mutation was also observed in the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish populations, with a relatively high prevalence
However, A673T mutation is extremely rare in non-Nordic populations.
In 2013, researchers genotyped the A673T mutation in 552 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, 790 subjects with Parkinson's disease, and 7379 controls, all Asian individuals.
A673T mutation was not relevant in all of the subjects
Researchers suggested that this mutation may only present in longevity subjects because of its protectiveness.
In 2014, in order to further explore whether the A673T mutation contributes to the Chinese population accurately, researchers genotyped the mutation in 2641 Chinese individuals comprising 1237 healthy longevity subjects with mean age 96.9 years and 1404 matched younger controls with mean age 44.2 years.
Nevertheless, the A673T mutation also failed to be observed in all of subject, either longevity subjects or younger controls
These nding suggested that the contribution of A673T mutation is not relevant to Asian population.
Similarly, studies in North American Whites with 1674 late-onset Alzheimer's disease cases and 2644 elderly controls were not found any examples of the A673T mutation
However, a Case-control association analysis in US and Swedish individuals found the A673T mutation.
In this study, 8943 US AD cases, 10480 US cognitively normal controls, 862 Swedish white AD cases, and 707 Swedish cognitively normal controls were genotyped for the mutation.
Among them, 3 US individuals heterozygous for A673T were identi ed, and all remaining US cases were homozygous for the alanine (A673) allele
One of 3 US heterozygous individuals was AD with an onset age of 89 years old.
It may be due to the incomplete data and the complex pathogenic factors of AD, such as environmental factor.
While, the other two heterozygous were controls aged 82 and 77 years at last examination.
A673T mutation is a rare mutation and may be con ned to speci c races/ ethnicities.
The mechanisms of A673T protection against AD Hereditary mutations can cause Alzheimer's disease, such as PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE4, APP, etc.
As one of the risk factors, APP has been discovered with more than 30 AD-related mutations.
Most of the common mutations in the APP are pathogenic, such as Swedish mutation next to the A673T mutation, which is a well studied familial AD (FAD) causing mutation and has been widely used as a classic animal model of AD in researches.
Similarly, the A673V mutation is pathogenic, which located at the same site as A673T.
While the A673T mutation is protective against AD, which makes us curious about the protective mechanism of
The A673T mutation is an alanine-to-threonine substitution at position 673 of APP
This substitution is adjacent to the β-secretase cleavage recognition site, and lies in the position 2 of the Aβ 1-xx peptide cleavage product (A2T).

Aβ generation
A673T mutation can promote a decreased propensity of the generation level of Aβ by altering the related secretase and metabolites in Aβ generation process called amyloidogenic pathway (Fig.
Mechanistically, it has been shown that A673T reduced both of sAPPβ and C99 levels by reducing BACE1 cleavage of APP in transfected mouse primary neurons and in isogenic human iPSC-derived neurons, resulting in reduced production of Aβ.
Speci cally, the mutation affects the catalytic turnover (V max ) of APP rather than APP binding a nity (K m ) for BACE1
Similarly, Kokawa and colleagues reported that the generation level of Aβ in A673T cells expressing C99 was roughly one-half of which observed in wild-type C99.
However, they observed that the level of C99 in A673T cells was indistinctive of which detected in wild-type cells, although a signi cant reduction of sAPPβ was found in A673T cells.
One possible explanation for this observation is that A673T APP or its production sAPPβ is preferentially processed by η-secretase
In addition, their reconstituted β-secretase assay reported that the level of Aβ33-FLAG production in APP 633-685-FLAG carrying A673T was comparable to that of the wild-type, suggesting that the A673T mutation has no effect on the β-cleavage of APP
While some research showed that A673T can reduce C99 generation and decrease the C99/C89 ratio by changing the cleavage site selection of BACE1 from β-site to β'-site, resulting in decreased production of Aβ 1-40 , but increased Aβ 11-40
In order to clarify whether conformational changes of APP caused by mutations (A673T, A673V or KM670/671NL) will affect BACE1 cleavage, we made structural predictions (Fig.
RaptorX prediction results visualized by Pymol showed extensively obvious differences between the possible 3D structure of the wild-type APP protein and APP protein with different mutations
Analyses revealed that the differences between the helical structure and sheet structure of APP protein with these mutations and wild-type APP protein at all regions of the protein were extensively obvious.
The helical structure of APP protein with protective mutation (A673T) and the sheet structure of APP protein with pathogenic mutation (A673V or KM670/671NL) around the mutation region was changed obviously, compared with the wildtype APP protein.
It suggested that the conformational change of APP caused by mutation may play a key role in the process of BACE1 cleavage.
In addition, in order to explore the effect of mutation in residue 673 of APP, the investigators substituted the alanine at the 673 rd amino acid position of APP with a series of amino acids, such as aspartic acid, leucine, and glutamine.
Compared with WT, all of these arti cial mutations except leucine reduced the level of C99, but increased the level of C89 and C83, the metabolites in APP processing by α-secretase.
It suggested that the site 673 of APP may be a key factor in determining APP metabolic pathway (amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic pathway)
ELISA of APP metabolites in rats carrying protective mutation showed that A673T can increase APP processing by α-secretase, which can prevent Aβ production, called non-amyloidogenic pathway, but decrease APP processing by β-secretase
Additionally, a cell-free assay revealed that Aβ production was more diminished in the microsomal fraction of C99 A2T cells compared to the WT with almost same level of C99
It suggested that the A673T mutation may affect the C99 processing by γ-secretase.
While a CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase assay allowing free collision between γ-secretase and C99 A2T in the solution demonstrated no signi cant difference in Aβ production of C99 A2T compared with the C99 wild-type, which contradicts the observation above and caused by destruction of C99 A2T intact distribution
It implied that A673T mutation may alter the subcellar components distribution of C99 processing by γ-secretase.
Not like our expectations that γ-Secretase was fail to recognize C99 with A2T, γ-secretase can recognize the amino terminus of C99
Moreover, studies showed that γ-secretase components accumulate in lipid raft fractions of membranes after sucrose gradient centrifugation
Although C99 will also be partially distributed to these lipid raft fractions, the subcellular distribution of γ-secretase components will not be affected when C99 carries A2T mutation.
While the level of C99 A2T co-distributed with γsecretase was signi cantly reduced.
The signi cant reduction of Aβ may be caused by the altered distribution of C99 with A2T
In addition, measurements in the laboratory had shown that the Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratio of A673T carrier was indistinctive of the controls, although similar reduction was observed in both Aβ 42 and Aβ 40 with A2T.
It suggested that the reduction of the different Aβ peptides was not mediated by the γ-secretase-related modulation
Moreover, the A673V mutation and Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL) cause FAD by altering APP processing, shifting the preferential β-cleavage site of BACE1 from the major Glu11 site to the minor Asp1 site, increasing the V max of BACE1 for APP, resulting increased β-CTF and Aβ production compared to WT.
Most importantly, the A673V mutation can still produce less Aβ than the Swedish mutation, although A673V mutation can produce more C99 than the Swedish mutation.
It's due to the increase of C99 degradation by the proteasome and decrease of its cleavage by γ-secretase
Aβ aggregation and Microglial uptake A673T mutation promote a decreased propensity for Aβ aggregation
This single amino acid substitution in Aβ peptide alters its own properties.
Using thio avin-T (ThT) incorporation and uorescence, Aβ 1-42 containing the A2T mutation showed a reproducibly lower level of aggregation compared with the wild-type.
By contrast, the aggregation kinetics of Aβ 1-40 expressing A2T mutation was indistinctive of which observed in wild-type.
When Aβ 1-42 and Aβ 1-40 were mixed together in a 1:9 ratio, an approximate representation of their heterogeneity in human cerebrospinal uid, Aβ containing the A2T mutation showed slightly slower aggregation kinetics compared with the wild-type
While A2V carriers showed increased aggregation kinetics for Aβ 1-40 peptides than the WT, not Aβ 1-42 peptides
These above effects of A2T on Aβ provide another angle to understand the pathogenesis of AD.
Maybe the risk of AD depend upon APP metabolites, not just Aβ.
Most importantly, the relative protective effect of the A673T mutation does not change or even more robust when other mutations coexist, such as A673T mutation in ApoE4 carriers et al.
And the pathological conditions caused by these pathogenic mutations may be counteracted by A673T mutation
In order to clarify whether conformational changes of Aβ caused by mutations will affect the aggregation level of Aβ, we have made structural predictions of wild-type Aβ 1-40 or Aβ 1-42 protein and Aβ 1-40 or Aβ 1-42 protein with A2T mutation or A2V mutation (Fig.
RaptorX prediction results visualized by Pymol showed possible 3D structure of the Aβ and Aβ with different mutations
The THR-2 form a hydrogen bond with GLU-3 in Aβ 1-42 A2T peptide.
While wild-type Aβ 1-42 peptide and Aβ 1-42 protein with A2V mutation do not form hydrogen bond at the same position.
And they all form a hydrogen bond in ASP-1.
While only the wildtype Aβ 1-40 peptid form a hydrogen bond in ASP-1.
Aβ 1-40 protein with A2T mutation or A2V mutation do not form hydrogen bond at the same position.
Jpred 4 prediction results showed that the probable secondary structure changes of Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 caused by mutations were extensively subtle
The helical structure and sheet structure of Aβ 1-40 had hardly changed.
While the helical structure of Aβ 1-42 protein with mutations around the mutation region were changed, compared with the wild-type Aβ 1-42 protein.
The sheet structure of Aβ 1-42 protein with mutations were not changed.
These prediction results may explain the aggregation level of Aβ 1-42 with mutations, further supporting the belief that aggregates have more β-strand structures and less α-helix content than the native
Microglial uptake is considered to be an important clearance mechanism for soluble Aβ in the brain
One may expect that A2T mutation would promote the microglial uptake of Aβ, especially for more toxic Aβ 1-42 peptides.
While contrary to our assumption, Aβ 1-42 peptides containing the A2T mutation was internalized to a much greater extent than Aβ 1-40 , which was approximately half of that observed in wildtype.
The Aβ clearance rate of microglia may affected by the slightly slower aggregation kinetics caused by A2T mutation.
While the Aβ with A2V mutant were internalized at high levels both as Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1- 42 species, because its higher aggregation state, which may further clarify the mechanisms of microglia uptake.

Cellular toxicity of Aβ
Cell toxicity may be association with aggregation propensity
It is believed that Aβ peptides are toxic to neurons, and even can induce cell death at high concentrations in vitro.
In a luminescent viability assay, cellular toxicity of Aβ peptides containing the A2T mutation and wild-type were indistinguishable from each other.
Cytotoxicity of the Aβ peptides with A2T mutant was not dramatically altered.
It seems somewhat counterintuitive, as the Aβ peptide containing protective mutation might be expected to be less toxic.
Similarly, the A2V mutant carriers showed slightly less toxic than the wild-type in vitro.
And Aβ oligomers are cytotoxic to cultured neurons
It is possible that fewer toxic oligomeric Aβ are present in A2V peptides.
In addition, the inhibition of mitochondrial axonal tra cking by amyloid beta protein (Aβ) is related to the early pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Mitochondrial motility plays an important role in supporting synaptic activity and calcium buffering.
Changes in mitochondrial dynamics may lead to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and memory decline.
Data from the tissues and cells of AD patients and animal models of FAD show that mitochondrial axon transport is affected in the early stage of the disease before memory impairment or amyloid plaques appear.
Exogenous Aβ peptide initiated the signaling cascade involved in the inhibition of plasma membrane axon transport.
The binding to the plasma membrane of neurons is su cient to cause a rapid and signi cant inhibition of axonal transport.
A2T can affect mitochondrial axonal transport, thereby protecting against AD
Studies have found that the aggregation state of Aβ have a great effect on mitochondrial axonal tra cking.
Aβ oligomers are the culprit in tra cking inhibition, and peptides with a higher aggregation tendency also have a greater inhibitory effect on this process.
The sequnce of N-terminal amino acid can in uence the formation of Aβ oligomers
Aβ oligomers containing the A2T mutation form approximately 50% less oligomers than wild-type
Moreover, it is di cult to predict the protective tra cking impact of A673T mutation on pathological amyloid accumulation.
Because the resulting aggregation of Aβ expressing A2T mutation remains substantial, especially in heterozygous carriers, although Aβ peptide with A2T showed lower level of aggregation than WT.
Furthermore, the binding of the Aβ peptide to the plasma membrane is su cient to induce tra cking inhibition, in which the peptides with reduced plasma membrane binding and internalization have little effect on mitochondrial motility.
Aβ peptide with A2T has a very low plasma membrane binding and internalization rate in neurons, which may explain its relatively low toxicity and protection against mechanisms for AD
Similarly, the binding a nity to synaptic receptors of Aβ oligomers containing the A2T mutation is >4-fold lower than wild-type
A673T mutation may affect the transmission of Aβ oligomers among various nerve cells, such as neurons, microglia, astrocytes, even the endothelial cells.
In addition, studies have shown that the level of transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) in hippocampal and cortical neurons of patients with sporadic AD is up-regulated, and the activation of APP mediated intracellular death signal induced by TGFβ2 may be one of the causes of sporadic AD [58].
TGFβ2induced neuronal death is intracellularly mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) which is independent of Aβ neurotoxicity
APP may be the receptor for the death-inducing ligand of TGFβ2.
When protective mutations appear on APP, intracellular death signal via APP induced by TGFβ2 will cease.
TGFβ2 did not induce neuronal death in SH-SY5Y cells expressing A598T, corresponding to the protective mutation A673T APP isoform APP770, but induced in SH-SY5Y cells expressing wt-APP [60].
A673T has a protective effect on JNK mediated intracellular death signal via APP induced by TGFβ2.
It is highly likely that the conformational change of APP prevents the functional interaction between APP and heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Go which is the rst signal molecule of intracellular death signal mediated by APP.
Moreover, this protective mutation can prevent the phosphorylation of JNK induced by TGFβ2.
JNK protein kinase family is one of the three mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase families.
JNK's, particularly JNK3 (MAK10), mainly located in neurons and was identi ed to phosphorylate Tau protein at Thr205 and Ser422 readily
JNK phosphorylation is one of the prime suspects for driving hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, which is the important pathology of AD.
TGFβ2 did not induce JNK phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells expressing A598T
These results may provide important hints for the protective mechanism of A673T mutation related to Tau protein synthesis and Aβindependent neurotoxicity against AD, and provide ideas for the study of protein kinase catalytic activity similar to JNK phosphorylation, such as GSK3β and CDK5, which can also effectively induce Tau protein phosphorylation causing AD

Conclusions: Challenges And Perspectives
In the treatment of AD drugs, the study of anti-Aβ drugs has always been dominant
In basic research and clinical trials, the most relevant experimental interventions are immunotherapy [65], β-secretase inhibitors [66], γ-regulators [67] and many Aβ aggregation inhibitors.
However, in recent years, some secretory enzyme inhibitors and immunotherapy experiments have failed continuously, such as the failure of Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab for moderate AD, and the related anti-Aβ research has been signi cantly reduced [68
There are many explanations for the failure of these clinical trials, including: 1.
The Aβ hypothesis may be wrong.
Up to now, the positive or negative effects of Aβ on the occurrence and development of AD have not been determined.
2.The onset of AD is caused by a variety of complex factors, and its mechanism is not clear yet.
Therefore, it may not be effective to treat AD only for a single pathological process.
Recently, one study found that the anti-cancer drug Gleevec and its related compounds can mimic the action of the protective mutation A673T.
They can make APP di cult to be hydrolyzed by BACE protein without inhibiting BACE enzyme activity or other BACE substrate processing.
In addition, Gleevec can also induce the formation of a speci c set of APP C-terminal fragments, which were also observed in cells expressing APP protective mutations and cells exposed to conventional BACE inhibitors.
These compounds have also been shown to reduce the number of APP for amyloid processing exposed to BACE and γ -secretase by increasing protein transport from plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum to lysosome.These results provide evidence for the Aβ hypothesis and provide important hints for the protective mutation A673T as a therapeutic target.
In the 1960s, American molecular biologist Lederberg J proposed the initial concept of gene therapy, which laid the foundation for the development of gene therapy
In 1995, the rst successful clinical case of gene therapy about severe combined immunode ciency syndrome (SCID) was reported and considered as an important milestone in the development of gene therapy
Since that, gene therapy has developed rapidly, especially after the emergence of gene editing technology.
Already today, gene therapy is used in the clinic to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
Luxturna, Glybera Strimvelis and other three drugs for the treatment of rare diseases were approved for marketing
However, the development of gene therapy is not always smooth sailing.
From the death of the subject due to the fatal immune response in a clinical trial of adenovirus gene therapy conducted by Dr. James Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999 to the gene-editing babies event in 2018, gene therapy always arouses widespread discussion and controversy internationally, especially for the ethics of editing the human genome [80-82].
These challenges and opportunities inspire researchers to go in new directions, and drive development of gene therapy for human health.
Acquired immunode ciency syndrome (AIDS), an infectious disease caused by HIV, may be cured following CCR5Δ32/Δ32 allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation
In addition, multiple lines evidence revealed that the potential of gene therapy to alter neurological diseases
The death of AD is an inevitable outcome generally occurring within 5-12 years of symptom onset, and the dementia due to AD is throughout the disease course
Caregivers and the public health sector face enormous burden
There is a dire need for effective research and development that may prevent or slow the rate of AD progression, but unfortunately none are currently available over the past 20 years.
Though numerous mid-to-late-stage clinical trial have failed to demonstrate bene ts, researchers are still actively developing and testing novel therapeutic strategies.
While it is unclear how early A673T mutation is needed to provide protection from AD, these mechanistic studies of A673T mutation further validate efforts to reduce the generation and aggregation level of Aβ, the pathological hallmarks of AD, as therapeutic approaches to treat AD.
Recently, various stem cells (ESCs, MSCs, NSCs, and iPSCs) therapy and gene therapy for AD have be introduced as a suitable therapeutic source
One may expect that A673T mutation would alleviate or even treat AD by inducing A673T mutation of stem cells based on methods such as the CRISPR system and transplanting them into hypothalamus because of suppressed Aβ production.
At present, Taisia Rolova and colleagues have generated a human iPSC line (UEFi003-A) carrying heterozygous A673T variant
Furthermore, A673T was a natural mutation, which is a mutation existing in natural people found among Icelanders.
Most importantly, there is no research showing that A673T mutation can cause other diseases until now.
A673T based AD therapies may represent potential strategies in the future.
