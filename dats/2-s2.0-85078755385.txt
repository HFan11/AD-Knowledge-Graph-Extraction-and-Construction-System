Amylin as a Potential Link between Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer Disease
Martinez-Valbuena et al.
They noted pancreatic amylin-Aβ and amylin-tau deposits in humans with AD in the absence of type-2 diabetes, which the authors interpreted as potential evidence for a role of Aβ and tau tangle
pathology in insulin resistance in these subjects.
We suggest an alternative interpretation of this finding that we base on four key observations: 1, pancreatic β-cells express and process both the Aβ protein precursor and tau mRNAs 2 implying that amylin-Aβ and amylin-tau inclusions may originate from the pancreas; 2, affected age-groups and clinical trajectories in type-2 diabetes and late-onset AD generally indicate that diabetes most commonly precedes AD and is associated with an acceleration of the transition from mild cognitive impairment to dementia; 3, consistent with this observation and because rodent amylin is non-amyloidogenic, rodent AD models do not develop type-2 diabetes, whereas pancreatic expression of amyloid-forming human amylin in non-AD rats causes type-2 diabetes, brain amylin deposition and behavior deficits
Consequently, AD may impair central signaling pathways that regulate amylin secretion leading to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and impaired clearance of amylin, Aβ and tau.
We therefore posit that the presence of mixed amylin-Aβ or amylin-tau inclusions in the pancreatic β-cells of patients with AD may reflect an in situ stress response to comorbid endocrine dysfunction and amylin dyshomeostasis.

Taken together with published evidence showing the presence of mixed amylin-Aβ pathology in human AD
Without excluding possible contributions of Aβ and tau tangle pathology to the development of type-2 diabetes, our alternative interpretation only serves to emphasize the need for in vivo studies that can further elucidate the temporal sequence of amylin-and Aβ-mediated pathological events involving type-2 diabetes and AD.
