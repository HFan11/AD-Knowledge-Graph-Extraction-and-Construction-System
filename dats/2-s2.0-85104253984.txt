Bridging Scales in Alzheimer's Disease: Biological Framework for Brain Simulation With The Virtual Brain
Despite the acceleration of knowledge and data accumulation in neuroscience over the last years, the highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease of AD remains a growing problem.
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease.
For AD, disease-modifying treatments are presently lacking, and the understanding of disease mechanisms continues to be incomplete.
In the present review, we discuss candidate contributing factors leading to AD, and evaluate novel computational brain simulation methods to further disentangle their potential roles.
We first present an overview of existing computational models for AD that aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of the disease.
Next, we outline the potential to link molecular aspects of neurodegeneration in AD with large-scale brain network modeling using The Virtual Brain (www.thevirtualbrain.org),
an open-source, multiscale, whole-brain simulation neuroinformatics platform.
Finally, we discuss how this methodological approach may contribute to the understanding, improved diagnostics, and treatment optimization of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Every second senior with age above 90 years suffers from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another dementia
The US's mortality rate for people with this neurodegenerative disease exceeds that of breast cancer and prostate cancer combined
Beyond the impact on patients' and their families' life circumstances, neurodegenerative diseases have an enormous economic impact and hence pose a massive societal burden.
The Alzheimer's Association's latest report estimates the annual medical and care costs attributed to AD in the US at $290 billion in 2019
By 2050, this number is expected to rise as high as $1.1 trillion
It is stated in the same report that early diagnosis at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) could save up to $7.9 trillion in cumulated medical and care costs by the year 2050.
While the prevalence of AD, the most common type of neurodegenerative disease
No disease-modifying treatment exists for AD.
Despite the collection of large data sets and major advances in high throughput computational methods, theoretical frameworks that link the many pieces of observations together can aim to infer novel insights about the underlying causes
The brain has multiple organization levels (e.g., molecular, cellular, ensemble-and region-level), including both feedback and feedforward interactions between and within those different levels
These dependencies are non-linear, leading to emergent phenomena-features of the system that cannot be understood by the simple "sum" of its parts
Small perturbations in such non-linear systems can have enormous, widespread consequences.
In the brain, interactions traverse many spatial and temporal scales, thus focusing on one scale can underestimate the emergent phenomena at other scales.
Integrative brain modeling allows for the analysis of these multiple scales in parallel
A mechanistic understanding of AD could open new horizons for early diagnostics and cause-targeting treatments.
Recent pharmacological clinical trials testing substances such as anti-Amyloid-beta
The development of novel therapeutics would benefit from theoretical and computational approaches
We hypothesize that an important contribution to understanding and curing AD lies in characterizing the features and processes that control emergent phenomena in the brain.
A deep understanding of state-of-the-art biological research on AD and detailed knowledge of computational brain modeling tools are essential to reach this goal.
In this review, we summarize current findings of AD pathogenesis from genomics to connectomics-describing the contribution of the classic hallmark proteins as well as current research on the Notch-1 pathway, neurotransmitters, polygenetic factors, neuroinflammation, and neuroplasticity.
In the second part, we present various previous approaches to computational modeling of AD disease mechanisms and discuss their benefits and disadvantages.
The last part describes The Virtual Brain (www.thevirtualbrain.org)
as a multiscale brain simulation platform that enables linking molecular signaling cascades with large-scale brain simulation.
An overview of the structure of this article is given by the flowchart in Figure

BACKGROUND Historical Considerations
While dementia is nowadays a descriptive term for (acquired) severely impaired cognitive function due to a brain disease, dementia has historically been understood as a mainly physiological loss of mental function in the elderly
Psychiatrists had therefore contrasted cognitive disorders of young people ("dementia praecox"), classified today as schizophrenia, for example, with dementia in old people, "dementia senilis"-i.e., the classification of dementia was dependent on the age at which the cognitive impairment occurred
A profound challenge to this concept was posted in 1907 by an observation of Alois Alzheimer.
His patient, Auguste D., had characteristic psychopathology of dementia senilis rapidly progressing-at an early age of 56 years
Based on his observations of an "unusual disease, " a new neurologic and psychiatric research field emerged.
Various mechanisms, risk factors, etiologic components (i.e., underlying causes such as neurotoxic proteins, risk-modifying genes, etc.), and comprehensive classifications of cognitive disorders were developed.
Interestingly much later in 2013
Nevertheless, the primary cause of AD and also criteria for its diagnosis still remain unclear.
Even the disease-defining biochemical findings of pathology in AD, represented by Amyloid-beta (Aβ40 and Aβ42, hereafter Abeta) and phosphorylation of Tau protein (TAU for tubulinassociated unit or by the Greek letter τ , hereafter Tau; for a review, see
Nevertheless, their presence during pathogenesis is undisputable

Definition and Diagnostic Criteria
Nosology is the discipline of disease classification based on the underlying mechanisms.
In this sense, a disease class can only be assigned if the respective disease's underlying etiology has been established.
Otherwise, we speak of a "syndrome" or "disorder"
The dementia syndrome encompasses a broad array of different possible etiologies of cerebral or systemic origin
Clinically it presents as a set of signs and symptoms.
The affected neurocognitive domains are the higher cortical functions: memory, language, attentional processing, executive functions, and visuospatial domains.
Different diagnostic criteria are currently used for the diagnosis of AD.
Among the most commonly used diagnostic criteria is the 1984 National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) definition of possible and probable AD purely by clinical (e.g., daily-life impairments) and neuropsychological criteria without further diagnostic evaluation by technical means
At the core of this definition are the presence and slow progression of cognitive decline in two or more cognitive domains, including memory, and the absence of alternative causes of dementia.
The 2011 revision of these criteria further specified that impairment in activities of daily living is necessary for the diagnosis of dementia
In clinical practice, a diagnosis is mainly made based on the definition of probable AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA and by excluding possible other causes of dementia
A challenge with this purely symptomatic definition is posed by the various phenomenological forms of AD
Clinical symptoms and neurodegeneration occur on a continuum.
They can vary tremendously between patients.
The most common phenotype of AD is the slowly progressive amnestic variant.
However, it is not uncommon for language disorders, disorientation, apraxia, or neuropsychiatric signs such as affective symptoms to appear first, while memory deficits do not seem to be predominant.
This heterogeneity in phenotypes can have various causes, such as educational and social factors, the individual brain's structural vulnerability, or the patient's cognitive "reserve"
The clinical definition of AD is further complicated by the overlap of symptoms with those of other dementias and comorbidities that can influence the clinical presentation.
For example, if the patient also suffers from depression, possibly caused by beginning cognitive decline, this mood disorder itself can impact memory.
Positive biomarkers are marked with a "+"-sign.
As neurodegeneration is not specific for AD, N is usually placed in parentheses.
The disease's cognitive dimension is defined separately and can be added to the classification as the letter C in its extension AT(N)(C).
This definition is primarily intended for research and not used in routine clinical practice
It is debated whether this definition may prevent shifting scientific attention to other relevant candidate factors contributing to AD-which might lead to missing mechanistic cascades beyond Abeta and Tau proteins
While the NINCDS-ADRDA definition only considers cognitive symptoms, the NIA-AA definition does not consider cognitive symptoms in their core AT(N) classification
Therefore, possible, more specific classifications could be "Alzheimer's disease with dementia" or "Alzheimer's disease with mild cognitive impairment" instead of the currently used term "Alzheimer's dementia, " which merges both AD pathologic changes and dementia syndromes
Even though clinical classification for probable AD
Autopsy is preferred to highly invasive in vivo interventions for a definitive diagnosis of AD, due to the lack of causal disease-modifying treatment options.
The confirmation rate of clinically diagnosed AD by autopsy was calculated in a metaanalysis with a sensitivity of 85.4% and specificity of 77.7%
However, even neuropathological examination of brain tissue as the state-of-the-art gold standard method for AD diagnosis often reveals several protein-related pathologies, i.e., those representing the typical picture for AD plus others that have been associated with different neurodegenerative diseases
Possible prodromal stages of dementia, e.g., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline, do not meet clinical criteria for a dementia syndrome because patients do not have deficits in their activities of daily living.
In MCI, cognitive deficits are measurable but still do not affect activities of daily living
In the case of subjective cognitive decline, it is not possible to objectively measure the deficits in neuropsychological examinations, but patients notice cognitive deficits themselves
These states may in some cases be phase transitions of disease progression to dementia.
In combination with other factors, they may help to assess an individual's risk of developing manifest dementia
Diagnosis is often an important question for patients and their families-even without helpful therapeutic interventions because it provides more certainty regarding the prognosis of the disease and the development of care plans.
However, it is often unclear to what extent distinct types of dementia and related disorders contribute to cognitive impairment

Epidemiology
Neurodegeneration is a continuum where several factors, such as proteinopathies, vascular and immunological changes, are likely to interact
Within the spectrum of dementias, the most common dementia is due to AD, followed by vascular dementia and mixed dementia which is a combination of AD and vascular dementia (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) (Figure
Frontotemporal dementias and Parkinsonian syndromes, particularly Lewy-body dementia and Parkinson's dementia, occur with lower prevalence than AD
A systematic overview of the most common and clinically important dementias is presented in Figure
Nevertheless, this differentiation is a simplification, as many secondary dementias arise from neurodegenerative processes during the disease course of primarily non-neurodegenerative diseases.
A well-known example is the neurodegenerative course in late stages of multiple sclerosis
The relevance of a correct diagnosis of the specific form of dementia results from the different treatment strategies and prognoses related to different types of dementia.
Some possible causes of dementia are curable, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus, metabolic disorders, and immunologic or infectious causes.
While presently no disease-modifying therapy for any primary neurodegenerative disease exists
This is particularly important for approaches that aim to model AD mechanisms with patient data, as the resulting model will only be as specific to AD as the patients' assigned correct
An overview of the experimental therapies that are in development for AD can be found in Table
For the established treatments for other dementia causes, we refer to Table
The population over 80 years of age is the group in which the prevalence of dementia is increasing most rapidly
While different pathogenic pathways have been hypothesized for AD and vascular dementia, it is increasingly acknowledged that both diseases share many risk factors
However, interactions of Abeta in AD with vascular factors [e.g., altered blood-brain barrier permeability caused both by microvascular changes and Abeta deposition
An increased rate of cerebrovascular disease manifestations and thus a higher incidence of vascular dementia correlates with lifestyle and atherogenic risk factors such as physical activity
However, mechanisms whereby these factors mediate their impact, have been debated
One hypothesis is that microvascular lesions remain undiscovered, leading to a failure to diagnose vascular or mixed dementia.
Another possibility is the involvement of metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis.
Notably, the most important genetic risk factor in the general population is apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 hetero-or monozygotic, an allele of a metabolic gene that also modulates atherosclerotic risk
Especially in the elderly, the prevalence of both atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration increases exponentially and could likely affect the same individuals
Although the role of metabolic factors is not clear, epidemiological approaches have shown that up to one-third of cases attributed to AD might be preventable by addressing these modifiable risk factors
However, this evidence comes from a mere observational method using the population-attributable risk.
This statistical method describes the fraction of the incidence of a disease attributed to one particular risk factor.
While this index allows an estimation of the effect that might follow removing the risk factor, as a result of an observational study, it precludes establishing a clear causal relation between observed risk factors and the disease
For example, if the definition of AD in the underlying observational study is inconsistent and therefore contains also other disease entities as mixed dementia, the population-attributable risk would be related to mixed dementia as well as to AD itself.
Therefore, reducing atherosclerotic risk factors might affect the mixed dementia patients instead of "pure" AD cases.
Shown is an elderly cohort (n = 185) with a mean age of 97.7 years in an autopsy study.
On the left, we see the prevalence of the cognitive states within this cohort at the time of death.
More than half of the people suffered from dementia in this age group, while a quarter suffered from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and another quarter had no cognitive disturbances.
On the right, the clinical diagnosis (ante mortem) for the subpopulation that suffered from dementia is shown.
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia; however, mixed forms and other primary neurodegenerative dementias as synucleinopathies or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum also play a role as well as vascular dementia (VD).
In the post mortem analysis, the full cohort showed at least partial AD-related pathologic changes: 100% had neurofibrillary tangles of at least Braak stage I, and 63% had neuritic plaques.
The mean Braak stage was in the dementia group 4.1, in the non-dementia group 3.2 (p < 0.001).
However, the dementia group also showed a significant higher Lewy-body pathology (p = 0.018) and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) pathology (p < 0.001) as well as a higher rate of definitive cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.016).
These findings indicate that in particular in the "super old," different neuropathologic changes are probably concomitant and contribute to the development of cognitive decline in dementia-in contrast to the concept of "pure" AD as an isolated neurodegenerative disease.

BRAIN ALTERATIONS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: FROM GENES TO BRAIN NETWORKS Genetics
Early-onset AD can be a familial disease with rare structural variants or copy number variants in genes that regulate Abeta production and clearance.
For example, structural variants in the Amyloid beta precursor protein gene (APP) affect posttranslational processing of APP by secretases leading to excess Abeta in early-onset AD.
The presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes form the active component of the γ -secretase complex.
It is critical for processing APP and other type-I integral membrane proteins, including members of the Notch signaling pathway and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4 (ERBB4)
Autosomal dominant mutations of PSEN1 and PSEN2 affect endopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activity, leading to longer and more toxic forms of Abeta peptides
Other environmental and genetic factors may contribute to the etiology of early-onset AD
In contrast, late-onset AD is a complex genetic disease in which rare structural variants and common variants, mostly identified by genome-wide association studies, play an influential role in etiology.
The heritability of late-onset AD is estimated to be high, with ∼50%
The single nucleotide polymorphism based heritability estimates are usually high in AD, at ∼25-30%
APOE E2/E4 polymorphisms alone explain ∼25% of the single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability, while common single nucleotide polymorphisms explain the remaining 5-7%
The most recent three genomewide association studies have identified 40 independent risk loci
The majority of these loci have functions in three main pathways: lipid metabolism, microglial activation, and APP processing
Notably, many of these loci contain functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms that impact expression in AD-associated cortical tissues and correlate with the so-called expression of quantitative trait loci

Protein Level
Two of the most relevant proteins associated with the pathogenesis of AD are Abeta and phosphorylated Tau.
Abeta is a human protein that-due to an abnormally cleaved FIGURE 3 | Mind map of the dementia syndrome and its differential diagnoses.
The possible etiologies are widely spread across cerebral and systemic diseases.
It is important to mention that Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, but AD is not trivial to diagnose, in particular, if it requires to forgo some invasive tests in the elderly.
However, the exact diagnosis is of enormous relevance because some possible causes of dementia are curable, such as normal pressure hydrocephalus, metabolic disorders, and immunologic or infectious causes.
In the clinic, most patients are diagnosed with AD, vascular dementia, Lewy-body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, or a mixed form thereof (Figure
None of the primary neurodegenerative diseases can be treated in a causal and disease-modifying way, besides the treatment of vascular dementia with general atherosclerosis therapy.

configuration-aggregates in neuritic plaques leading to its (neuro-)toxic effects
It can be found both intra-and extracellularly
It has been suggested that the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein develops as a consequence of the aggregation of Abeta
However, phosphorylated Tau is also present in other neurodegenerative diseases not associated with Abeta deposition
Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue, which is more sensitive than standard microscopical tissue examination, reveals up to 92-100% of Tau in people who died with neurodegenerative disorders at a mean age of 71 years, in contrast to Abeta with 20-57%
All subjects who met the official clinicopathological criteria for AD [ADNPC, defined as the presence of Abeta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques
However, in the same group of patients, two other protein pathologies were measured: alpha-synuclein (SNCA, associated with several diseases of the Parkinson spectrum) was present in 41-55% and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43, associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia) in 33-40% of patients (Figure
Therefore, "pure" AD was a rare case in this cohort as 65-70% of confirmed AD patients suffered at least from one other neurodegenerative comorbidity

Amyloid-Beta
The deposition of Abeta typically follows a particular spatiotemporal pattern in the progression of AD.
An illustration of this distribution, initially described by
The course can be divided into three general stages
Stage A develops along the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices.
Stage B involves the hippocampus proper and neighboring regions like the posterior gyrus parahippocampalis.
Stage C also encompasses a wide distribution of neocortical areas.
Table
One possible explanation of the pathogenic deposition of Abeta is a maladaptive change in its processing, regulated by a group of secretases and other enzymes.
We give only a brief overview here.
APP is a transmembrane protein whose function has been associated with neural development and synaptic plasticity
It can be processed into different subdomains.
One possible way is the subsequent procession by the α-secretase and the γ-secretase, called the non-amyloidogenic pathway
This "physiological" pathway does not lead to Abeta fragments (with β-helix), which can later aggregate to plaques, but APP is transformed into a protein subdomain with α-helix configuration
In another "pathological" pathway, APP is processed to soluble Abeta with a β-helix configuration by the βsecretase (and afterwards again by the γ-secretase).
The βhelices allow molecules to aggregate into Abeta oligomers and
The darker color indicates a higher load of this protein in the respective brain area.
The regions are listed in Tables

Curable dementia cause Diagnostic tool Therapy

Major depression
afterwards polymers which become insoluble and deposit in the extracellular space, forming the so-called Abeta plaques.
This pathway's activation leads to decreased Abeta concentration in cerebrospinal fluid because its insoluble configuration cannot be measured therein
The imbalance between these two pathways, represented by the activity of α-and the β-secretase, is suggested to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD and is currently the target of various experimental treatment strategies
Another important feature, linked not only to the protein metabolism of Abeta but also to neural development, is the notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1) pathway
NOTCH1 is a membrane protein that plays a major role as the transcription factor for both its intracellular-and extracellular domain
The processing of NOTCH1 to its subdomains is performed by the γ-secretase-the same secretase involved in the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing
APP and NOTCH1 are co-substrates in the extracellular domain of the γ-secretase
NOTCH1 is found in Abeta plaques, and its intracellular signaling is reduced in AD

Amyloid deposition-

Tau Protein
In the absence of any additional neuropathological factors in several dementias, phosphorylated Tau may play a major role in the degenerative process of so-called primary tauopathies.
This group includes, e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy
In contrast, in secondary tauopathies, Tau seems to be involved in the pathogenesis only when other factors are present, as, e.g., in prion diseases and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
From this point of view, AD has a unique context because it is neither classified as a primary tauopathy (due to the concomitant presence of Abeta) nor is the amyloid pathology ultimately linked to Tau's hyperphosphorylation.
However, phosphorylated Tau density correlates better with the severity of cognitive decline than the accumulation of Abeta itself
Hence, there is controversy about the role of Tau protein in AD as either an independent disease factor or an indicator of general neurodegeneration derived from the neurotoxic effects of amyloid deposition.
Clinical trials, based on anti-Tau-antibodies and -vaccines, modulators of Tau aggregation, and antisense oligonucleotides targeting its gene the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT), are currently ongoing for AD patients
Tau protein pathology is complex and involved in several neurodegenerative processes
Different forms of neurodegeneration lead to the deposition of Tau
In general, the phosphorylation homeostasis of the Tau protein is maintained by a series of kinases.
A turn of this equilibrium toward hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein shows two consequential effects: first, Tau loses its natural function of microtubule stabilization followed by disturbed axonal transportation of vesicles, leading to disturbed axonal signal transmission.
Second, the hyperphosphorylated Tau protein polymerizes to insoluble filaments and big tubular aggregates, the so-called neurofibrillary tangles.
The brain's clearance system is unable to eliminate these aggregates leading to inflammatory processes and, eventually, neuronal death
These phenomena have been observed using three methods: (i) microscopy of neuronal tissue with neurofibrillary tangles, (ii) an increased concentration of the hyperphosphorylated Tau section in the cerebrospinal fluid, and (iii) non-invasive nuclear imaging methods that trace Tau protein (flortaucipir PET)
Because of its two main effects, namely neuronal death and axonal dysfunction, Tau leads to a disconnection of the affected regions in the brain network.
This has been measured in regions with high binding of flortaucipir PET tracing the Tau protein
However, the Tau protein is a better marker in diagnostics for the severity of cognitive dysfunction than Abeta in AD
The local neurotoxic effects of Tau can be linked to network disruption and an increased clinical score of apathy symptoms
The stages of Tau deposition (defined by post mortem histopathological criteria), similar to Abeta stages, are called Braak Tau deposition stages
The patterns of post mortem neuropathological and nuclear imaging findings are illustrated in Table
For this reason, most patients with "typical" AD show early Tau depositions years before the onset of symptoms in the medial temporal lobe.
The so-called transentorhinal stage consists of stages I and II and concerns the transentorhinal cortex in the ventromedial temporal lobe, and later the entorhinal cortex in the lamina granularis externa (Lamina II).
This prodromal stage is followed by a further spreading into the limbic lobule (stages III and IV, involving mainly the hippocampus and the temporal allocortex) and finally into the neocortex (stages V and VI)
The six stages of this dissemination process of Tau deposition fall into three functional stages (i.e., transentorhinal/entorhinal, limbic, and neocortical), and have a high correlation to the cognitive decline of an individual AD patient
Only a few amyloid plaques and often no clinical symptoms can be observed in this first functional category.
In detail, the non-obligatory prodromal stage of AD is characterized by an MCI, which often converts to the full clinical presentation of dementia and has, thus, a significant correlation to higher Braak Tau deposition stages
In the limbic stage, the Tau deposition is strongly associated with clinical symptoms of MCI stage (e.g., memory function, verbal fluency, impairments of daily life activities)
In the highest functional stage, which concerns the neocortex, most patients have amnestic impairment

Tau deposition stage
Anatomic region 18  Taylor and Probst, 2008).
Similarly, the Tau protein deposition traced by flortaucipir PET correlates with the clinical presence of MCI as well as with AD and with cognitive performance
There seems to be a high correlation in general of Tau and amyloid deposition patterns described above; however, it is worth mentioning that the three stages of amyloid deposition described by
The six stages of Tau deposition follow a stricter distribution course and show some overlap with the amyloid deposition stages, in particular, within the ventromedial temporal allocortices and pro-isocortices and later temporoparietal neocortices (Tables
The effects of both pathologies differ to a larger extend, for instance, in the specificity to AD, to neurodegeneration in general, or to cognitive functions
However, the "macro sequence" of archicortex-mesiotemporal cortex-temporoparietal neocortex is the same, and the impaired cognitive domains in AD (memory and visuoconstruction) are associated with those regions.

Neurotransmitters
Of interest in AD pathogenesis are especially two transmitter systems: the cholinergic and the glutamatergic systems.
Acetylcholine is one of the essential neurotransmitters in the brain.
Its functions are pleiotropic: acetylcholine is a fundamental transmitter in the peripheral vegetative nervous system and neuromuscular transmission.
In the brain, acetylcholine is involved in many functional systems but particularly involved in the modulation of synaptic signaling (Van der
The dysfunction of the cholinergic system is relevant in the pathogenesis of AD, as acetylcholine is essential for memory consolidation
Anti-dementia drugs work as inhibitors of the acetylcholine esterase, increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic gap, leading to slightly improved memory function
Cholinergic effects have been shown to be involved in learning processes in the hippocampal formation by the enhancement of synaptic modification and selective presynaptic inhibition of synaptic transmission in different regions and layers
The beneficial effect of acetylcholine on memory encoding is probably mediated by strengthened synaptic modification, afferent input and spiking behavior
On a functional level, cholinergic modulation has been linked to working memory for novel stimuli
It has been hypothesized that synaptic connections exist for previously familiar stimuli (such as words or numbers)
Moreover, acetylcholine is involved in excitability modulation in AD.
While memory performance during task functional MRI can be correlated with activation of medial temporal lobe regions as the hippocampus and gyrus parahippocampalis, it was shown that stronger recruitment of those regions is associated with cognitive decline in MCI patients
The underlying hypothesis stated that hyperactivation could be seen as a compensatory effect due to hippocampal atrophy
Similarly, task functional MRI in cognitively still unimpaired PSEN1 mutation carriers revealed increased activation of the right anterior hippocampus compared to non-carrier controls, many years before the estimated disease onset of familial AD
This can be brought into context with the role of cholinergic suppression in learning and AD.
Runaway synaptic modification describes the phenomenon of exponential gain in synaptic connection strength, caused by activity evolving across already strengthened connections
It can be seen as a natural consequence of Hebbian rules
Cholinergic presynaptic inhibition of transmission along associative fibers offers a mechanism to protect from runaway synaptic modification during learning
However, when hyperactivity in AD is introduced, it leads to more runaway synaptic modification, while vice versa, the strengthening of undesired networks can lead to more hyperactivity in a vicious circle
The continuous presence of hyperactivation can further lead to excitotoxic effects
Excitotoxicity refers to calcium-mediated toxic effects due to a sudden increase in glutamatergic transmission.
Ashford and Jarvik hypothesized already in 1985 a preferential affection of FIGURE 5 | Overview of contributing factors in AD and potential intervention strategies.
Shown are only the most important factors, which are also described in more detail in this article's main text.
In the upper left corner, we see the neurovascular system.
Both characteristics of blood vessels (e.g., atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction)
A particular aspect here is the role of neural immunity, both with the brain-own microglia cells and the effect of systemic immune cells, e.g., mediated by antibodies
On the upper right corner, we see an illustration of the multiscale network structure of the brain.
Stimulation approaches as deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) act on the larger scale of a network-level; nevertheless, the actual changes happen on the level of synapses.
Also, transmitter interventions develop their effects mainly at the micro-scale of synapses.
In the lower right corner, basic molecular pathways in the extraand intracellular space of a neuron are shown.
We focused here on the processing of the two hallmark proteins Abeta and Tau, as well as the Notch-1 pathway, which is involved in memory
We illustrate the APP procession by the amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic way and its interaction with Notch-1 processing and, second, in the axon, the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau.

highly neuroplastic connections with neurofibrillary tangles
The concept of excitotoxicity is moreover essential for other transmitter systems as glutamate.
Anti-dementia drugs that are no inhibitors of the acetylcholine esterase-mainly the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine-decrease glutamatergic transmission in the synaptic cleft.
Glutamatergic dysfunction is also related to neuroinflammation and plasticity.

Neuroimmunology
Besides the cascades of Abeta and Tau, another important hallmark in AD pathogenesis is the role of neuroinflammation and autoimmunity.
One of the difficulties in understanding AD pathogenesis is that intrinsic proteinopathic dysfunction alone does not necessarily lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.
Such impairments are more likely to be caused by various toxic intermediate mechanisms, as discussed before.
One potentially important but poorly understood mechanism is neuroinflammation.
Neuroinflammation is a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of dementia because it is always the last part of the pathogenic cascade and leads directly to neuronal death
However, it is not clear how the modulation of inflammation can affect the process of neurodegeneration.
Clinical trials have shown contradictory results.
For instance, the long-term administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed positive preventive effects and can hence reduce the a priori risk for AD
However, in contrast to those observational studies, prospective trials with steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs have not shown significant effects, and neither have randomized controlled studies with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
A casecontrol study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (who have a slightly higher risk for AD) showed a significant reduction of AD incidence by 70% (adjusted Odds ratio of 0.30, p = 0.02) if the patients were treated with the tumor necrosis factor α inhibitor etanercept
As the etiology and differential diagnosis of dementia is often unclear, the label of AD could cover up a relevant percentage of autoimmunological neural phenomena that could be treated with high-dose and long-time corticosteroid therapies
Cerebral immunology is complex, as it involves the organ-specific immunological cell type of microglia.
An appropriate discussion would go beyond this review's scope, and we would like to refer the interested reader to the following review on neuroimmunology and AD

Imaging Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI offers a commonly used technique to screen for biomarkers in vivo.
As described, the pathogenetic pattern of AD consists of the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
Volumetric assessment of gray matter loss in MRI has been identified to correlate with the distribution and degree of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation
Therefore, volumetric MRI can provide a proxy measurement for regional neurofibrillary tangle load
AD patients have consistently been found to have atrophy of memory-related structures, including the hippocampus and other mesiotemporal regions, as well as the precuneus, cingulate, and the prefrontal areas
However, non-amnestic symptoms like aphasia, visuospatial problems, or behavior-predominant dysfunction are initially present in up to 30% of AD patients
The distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in those patients with an atypical clinical presentation is either limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing, or not reported, which is also referred to as the no-atrophy or minimalatrophy AD variant
A correlation between these phenomenological subtypes of AD and volumetric MRI has already been demonstrated
Multiple studies explored MRI as an in vivo marker of these AD subtypes
Besides the atrophy patterns of syndrome variants in AD morphology, a few single-regionbased volume reductions have also been identified as potential biomarkers for AD.
A detailed overview of these features is provided in Table
As a non-invasive in vivo measurement, MRI opens up the possibility of longitudinal tracking of atrophy and disease progression of AD.
Recent studies investigated volume loss in AD patients longitudinally
Regions with reduced baseline gray matter volume also tend to show more atrophy over time and the highest atrophy rates are in the temporoparietal regions
Besides gray matter atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, which appear on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI scans, have a high prevalence among AD patients
White matter hyperintensities, in general, can be morphological correlates of microvascular lesions as well as inflammatory or unspecific changes in aging.
Increased overall hyperintensity volume has been observed 6-22 years before estimated symptom onset of AD
The relationship between white matter hyperintensities and AD pathology is still an active research field

Nuclear imaging methods allow in vivo acquisition of metabolic features of the brain by using various radioactively marked tracer molecules, so-called radionuclides.
PET offers a remarkable possibility of different functional assessments of the brain.
The underlying procedure makes use of β + -emitters: the emitted positrons of β-decay react with electrons of the tissue in a socalled annihilation.
This leads to the emission of photons, which can be measured by specific sensors
Both Abeta and Tau deposits can be detected indirectly by PET and correspond well to the underlying pathologic changes at autopsy
Tau tracer binding in AD is not only increased in regions that are known to be affected in early Braak stages
However, Tau binding is also present in healthy controls, predominantly located in areas with atrophic changes
Similarly, Abeta tracers show increased global deposition in the whole brain
However, the percentage of "Abeta-positive" healthy controls seems higher than for Tau
Another important PET measurement is the assessment of energy metabolism by the usage of marked glucose molecules.
Multiple studies suggest temporoparietal hypometabolism in AD

An overview of PET findings in AD is provided in Table

Connectomics
After discussing the recent advances researching the microscopic molecular level in AD, we consider a whole-brain perspective at the macroscopic brain region level.
The connectomic approach is a neuroscientific discipline that analyzes, describes, and uses (axonal) connectivity measures of the brain
It provides an overview of the disease effects in AD and identifies global phenomena beyond the impairment of single regions.
In the general framework of brain networks, regions are represented by nodes, and connections between them (either structural or functional) are denoted as links or edges (Figure
At this level of abstraction, it is possible to calculate graph-theoretic measures for the connectome, so-called network metrics
A plethora of different-partly interdependent-metrics shows changes in AD networks compared to healthy controls.
An overview of these findings is provided in Table
This heterogeneity can also be explained by different methodological choices for network construction, e.g., setting different thresholds for filtering out the most essential connections
In general, however, converging evidence suggests aberrant functional connectivity (measured by functional MRI) and abnormal white matter structural connectivity in AD compared to healthy aging.
We review and align the recent literature on this topic showing multiple local network changes resulting in FIGURE 6 | Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from a network perspective.
In this schematic example network, the red links (edges) are being weakened and progressively disconnected by AD.
Preferentially, edges attached to nodes with high degree (hubs) are being targeted (here node A)
Besides, lower clustering in AD has repeatedly been observed
These two "attacks" of AD on the network lead not only to a lower clustering coefficient but also evoke a lower efficiency, defined here as the inverse of the global path length.
This lower efficiency is demonstrated in the example network by the shortest path length between the blue nodes D and E before and after the deletion of the red links (before: 4 links, after: 6 links).
the global phenomena of less efficient network communication for AD patients compared to healthy controls.
Connectomic research provides an important perspective for understanding the development of cognition and its decline in dementia.
There are various hypotheses about the network changes in dementia highlighting different aspects of neurodegeneration
One line of research refers to dementia as a disconnection syndrome
This disconnection correlated with the cognitive and behavioral decline
This view on AD as a disconnection syndrome was able to bridge multiple scales of disease pathology in a coherent way.
In recent years, however, network science studies on AD patients expanded this picture: widespread increases and decreases of connectivity within the brain network were observed, pointing toward compensatory mechanisms or reactions of the network beyond disconnection
Even an early but seminal study conveying the importance of "small networks studies, " especially related to the initial disease stages, showed isolation of the hippocampus from its cortical network connections through initial entorhinal cortex degeneration via the perforant pathway
In network science, brain regions with high connectivity to other regions are called hubs.
For both structural and functional connectivity studies, hub regions have consistently been identified as the most affected areas by AD
This vulnerability of hubs correlates with a higher Abeta burden in these hub regions
A focus of the disconnection in AD lies on the default mode network, a largescale network of regions strongly interconnected in resting state
Although this phenomenon is also observed in aging
Regarding the functional network, especially the default mode network is targeted by the AD-caused neurodegeneration
The extent of hub disruption correlates significantly with the cognitive status of a patient
Thus, it can be hypothesized that hubs-with their high Abeta deposition and central role in the overall information flow of the brain network-facilitate the spreading of the pathological cascade within the brains of AD patients
Aberrant or decreased functional connectivity has also been observed in the insula
Next to the vulnerability of hubs, a decreased global clustering coefficient has been reported, showing a loss of connectedness and important redundancy structures for brain communication in FC, which consequently also alters the modular structure of AD patients
Probably as a global effect of these "local attacks" on the network (Figure
Global efficiency is in network science defined as the inverse of the characteristic path length-with shorter pathways between the nodes, the information flow within the network is more efficient.
A less efficient network can still provide connections between nodes, but they are longer and with more nodes and edges in-between
Recent work analyzed a multimodal perspective on AD, combining diffusion tensor imaging, functional MRI, and magnetoencephalography measurements in a multilayer network
They found that the core of this multilayer network, which is likely to contain the hubs, has been most affected, which establishes hubs' vulnerability across modalities.
Together, these changes were able to predict the cognitive and memory impairment of patients
Emerging evidence suggests that in the preclinical stage of AD, network changes are present in the form of disconnection on a large scale
Indeed, functional connectivity and structural connectivity are now being investigated to better differentiate AD patients, MCI, and controls, moving toward the goal of identifying prodromal AD patients and the possibility of developing early intervention strategies
A recent study suggests altered functional connectivity corresponding to accelerated aging in preclinical AD
To sum up, both altered global and local connectivity have been associated with AD.
Converging evidence from white matter diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI studies point toward less efficient network communication in AD patients compared to healthy aging, especially in the default mode network.

MODELING OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
As AD is a complex disease that takes place on various scales, a wide range of models have been developed for its analysis, e.g., animal disease models
Mathematical modeling is an adaptive and creative scientific concept and a core technique of computational neuroscience.
In general, one can differentiate between approaches focusing on single aspects of the disease, e.g., biochemical Abeta modeling
The latter might provide a more comprehensive, multimodal view on the disease with its interacting mechanisms and might be more suitable to reflect disease pathogenesis.
This multiscale approach-also called "integrative disease modeling"
A comprehensive understanding of both the underlying biological processes of AD and the computational framework of high-performance modeling approaches is necessary to develop novel models for AD that integrate multiple scales, modalities, and research disciplines.
With increasing technical possibilities for high-performance computing and growing hierarchically organized knowledge architectures, this crossdisciplinary approach holds the potential to overcome some of the enigmas in AD pathogenesis that might not be revealed on a single scale applying a single method.
Therefore, in the following sections, we describe existing computational (brain) models of different scales and outline how far they can be linked to the biological concepts presented before.

Statistical Disease Prediction Models
Statistical prediction models are mainly descriptive when used in linear classification tasks.
Subjects are assigned to a diagnostic category (HC, MCI, or AD) based on the input data.
But beyond their practical translational usage as diagnostic tools, prediction models provide certain decision criteria that can also be of interest in understanding the underlying disease mechanisms
In addition to those rather simplistic linear models there are methods such as machine learning
All exhibit individual challenges and advantages regarding data analysis and model interpretation
Machine learning approaches are applied to predict disease trajectories (predictive modeling) or classify subjects into groups with highly similar data points (discriminative modeling or clustering).
The latter goal can be reached by supervised a priori labeling of the training data (e.g., as two classes AD and non-AD, or as a three-class problem with AD, MCI, and healthy controls) or by unsupervised clustering without labeling
Those unsupervised discriminative models cluster subjects based on the degree of (dis-)similarity between parameters.
This can be quantitatively expressed by statistical proximity measures
Structural T1-weighted MRI, in conjunction with other biomarkers, has been considered as a feature for classic machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines-often combined with linear discrimination analysis.
This held also true for the risk prediction of conversion from MCI to AD.
Thus, the classifiers' clinical relevance remains relatively low, given that-in practice-it is already possible to distinguish between controls and AD based on cognitive performance.
A diagnosis before clinically-noticed AD onset is therefore still missing.
Attempts of facilitating early AD prediction are therefore building biologically informed models that develop "mechanistic biomarkers" by aiming at a deeper understanding of AD pathomechanisms
To achieve that, a complex disease knowledge system (i.e., ontology) can be built from different data sources, and biologically plausible predictors are deduced.
This contrasts the approaches described above in which the selection of biomarkers is mainly based on statistical dependence (e.g., correlations).
Mechanistic biomarkers however resemble biologically plausible concepts instead of merely relating to the disease by correlation.
Using this approach, biological mechanisms of the transition from asymptomatic stages or MCI to AD have been computationally reconstructed to achieve a more accurate risk prediction
By using a predictive time-to-event model that incorporates multimodal data ranging from genetic variants to neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments, several biological risk factors and their interaction could be extracted
As the model makes use of a graph-like Bayesian network organization
Additionally, information about disease progression can be extracted from longitudinal patient data to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions.
For example,
Comparing different algorithms trained on multimodal data from two time points, a longitudinal predictive neural-network showed the highest performance, even after validation with a second untrained data set
This longitudinal and multimodal approach of predicting the individual risk and disease trajectories could thus represent promising new paths in personalized medicine.
Modeling structural and metabolic changes in different brain areas concerning the decline in cognitive functions can yield more sophisticated information about disease progression and its influencing factors on an individual level
Future approaches could also incorporate a broader range of data modalities from different sources, like the graphtheoretically-organized database European Brain Research Infrastructures (EBRAINS) of the Human Brain Project (
EBRAINS hosts detailed data for many brain areas from a variety of modalities, such as receptor densities (Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles, 2018) or gene expressions
Besides that, the Multimodal Mechanistic Signatures Database for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NeuroMMSig,
NeuroMMSig, a hierarchically organized ontology, integrates chemical compounds, genes, proteins, medical terms, and imaging features into a mechanistic pathway representation of AD.
These pathways (i.e., cause-and-effect chains of biological concepts or processes) were retrieved by methods of literature mining and condensed into 125 sub-networks that play a distinct role in the pathophysiology of AD
By integrating big databases like those described, promising new approaches for the predictions of individual disease trajectories with mechanistic cause-and-effect models are posed.

Sub-cellular Models
Brain simulation can occur on many different scales, as the complex topological hierarchy of the brain consists of many essential components: cortical and subcortical regions, networks, columns, ensembles, circuits, neurons, synapses, vesicles, molecules, and genes (compare Figure
Sub-cellular features of AD provide promising input for computational modeling based on protein interaction and gene expression.
Early AD modeling approaches have focused e.g., on the deposition process of Abeta
Moreover, biochemical models account for the interaction between numerous factors like Abeta, Tau, inflammation, and different proteases, as well as possible interventions during the disease course
Early studies have used computational modeling to assess aggregation kinetics for synthetic Abeta-like peptides
Comparably simple biochemical models allowed a mathematical description of the aggregation processas the temporal evolution of Abeta in the form of monomers, micelles, and fibrils
Subsequently, the Abeta aggregation theory was enhanced by including more detailed interactions between different forms of Abeta fibrils and fitting the model to empirical data
As experimental evidence on Abeta's toxicity increased, a particular model was developed that describes disrupted Ca 2+ homeostasis and Abeta aggregation as a positive feedback loop and their interaction in a vicious circle
Over the last decade, more specific models have included associations of AD to important gene transcription factors as p53
Concepts of sub-cellular modeling are valuable for integrating multiscale models as they describe the molecular hallmarks of AD in a computationally accessible manner.
Molecular pathways can be "coded" as a network of relations by employing computational linguistics and semantic frameworks.
One possible tool for this approach is the Biological Expression Language (BEL), which makes it possible to describe the interaction between proteins, genes, and other chemical compounds with means of first-order logic

Single-Neuron and Neural-Circuit Models
Besides the subcellular scope, AD models span over different microscopic scales, ranging from single-cell models
Single-neuron models are often inspired by an experimental approach, such as a patch-clamp experiment
Underlying mathematics for those single-cell simulations may refer to general formulations for neural oscillation models, as it is the case for Hodgkin-Huxley model
Hodgkin and Huxley delivered the first impactful mathematical description of electric conductances in a neuron model in 1952
The Hodgkin-Huxley model is based on experimental recordings on squid axons: By defining the phospholipid membrane's capacitance and the conductance of leak and voltage-gated ion channels, it enables a realistic approximation of membrane potentials over time
However, the model is computationally expensive, qualifying it mainly for simulations with either few neurons or small simulation length
There seems to be a dilemma between biologically plausible but comparably inefficient models (e.g.,
A possible solution was supposed by Izhikevich, providing a computationally efficient model with the ability to produce emergent biological phenomena as tonic and phasic spiking and bursting, frequency adaptation, and accommodation
The mean-field theory can integrate complex systems of a large number of neurons
The simplification of the mean field has its origin in physics to describe fluid or gas behavior without considering individual molecules.
In the brain, it allows simplifying the behavior of a spatially distinct group of neurons with a similar function
This group of neurons is called a neural mass and can be defined on various scales-e.g., as a brain region, a column, or a neuronal ensemble.
Neural mass models

Large-Scale Brain Network Models
The evolution of large-scale computational brain modeling has accelerated over the past decade.
de
This model is a largescale brain network derived from diffusion MRI, where each network node holds a neural mass model by
De Haan and colleagues simplified the synaptic strength as a function of neural activity over time
As a result, those connections transmitting higher activity became weakened after a certain time period.
The purpose of implementing this specific mechanism was to describe a form of excitotoxicity that leads to degeneration.
Here, after a certain period, one could consecutively observe degeneration in the functional and structural network topology using graph-theoretical measures.
The authors also observed a loss of spectral power and an increased sensitivity of hubs, defined as highly connected brain regions (incoming and outgoing ties)
The authors observed an increase in brain activity and functional connectivity in the model, similar to empirical findings in MCI or mild AD stages
A subsequent study by
The most convincing strategy, which could maintain healthy network features over a long time, was increasing excitability of excitatory neurons followed by increasing inhibition of inhibitory neurons.
At first glance, this might seem contradictory, but it suggests the reversal of hyperexcitability by either more excitation or less inhibition.
The authors suggested that the reason for this phenomenon might be in the network topology.
The best strategies suppress the network hub activities, which in return may lead to decreased disease propagation.
According to this prediction, neurodegeneration spreads along the network infrastructure as a kind of "pro-degenerative" signaling pattern.
This can be related to an earlier description of Hasselmo in 1994.
This model
In contrast to the work by de Haan et al. (
Pons and colleagues used another brain network model for AD
The authors used electroencephalography recordings that showed a slowing of the alpha rhythm and an increase in functional connectivity (using phase lag index) in MCI patients with age, i.e., the functional connectivity increased from young to old subjects.
In another recent modeling study, Demirtaş and colleagues investigated the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes due to AD
This study included 109 subjects from different groups (healthy controls, preclinical AD, MCI, and AD).
Regarding their empirical BOLD signal, one could observe a decrease in global interactions of AD patients evaluating first-order circular statistics, that is in the Kuramoto order parameter, as well as regional differences in the functional connectivity strengths, compared to the controls
Further, functional connectivity differences were correlated to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers like Abeta, total Tau, and phospho-Tau
Estimating individual effective connectivity from subjectspecific structural connectivity and functional connectivity with a heuristic approach, the brain model could replicate these observed changes
A supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation described its local dynamics.
In an in silico experiment using brain network models based on healthy subjects' effective connectivity, Demirtaş et al. systematically varied the order parameter of the model
In this way, they were able to observe the progress of functional connectivity degeneration.
An optimal order parameter was individually found for each disease stage and group, replicating best the empirical observed degeneration.
This study showed how changes in regional dynamics could lead to the disintegration of activity within the anatomical large-scale brain network.
Concurrently, simulations also replicated the finding that the interaction (measured by Kuramoto order parameter) between BOLD signals declines with disease progression.

The Virtual Brain Platform
In the following, we focus on The Virtual Brain, a multimodal and multiscale virtual brain simulation framework
The open-source platform of The Virtual Brain is available under www.thevirtualbrain.org.
The Virtual Brain is a standardized and an established framework that enables large-scale modeling approaches (as mentioned in the previous section Large-scale Brain Network Models) on individual patient data including a wide range of underlying dynamics.
The Virtual Brain uses the structural connectome as its underlying basis
Most of the neural mass models (representing the regional activity) implemented in The Virtual Brain had their origin as a network model for smaller, distinct networks.
But with the development of connectomics, the networks included were more complex and elaborate
Likewise, the local dynamic models used in The Virtual Brain were, in principle, composed of smaller or even single-neuron systems
The Virtual Brain was designed to simulate whole-brain network dynamics, but it can also model and simulate separate subnetworks ranging from a regional level to a few neurons (see
The second important feature of The Virtual Brain that can assist in AD research is the multiscale character.
This term has been coined to describe the fluid transition of brain scales, ranging from the macroscale, at which brain regions interact intra-and inter-hemispherically via long-range connections, to the microscale of myriads of single neurons, where we have the knowledge on their electrophysiological properties, receptors, transmitters, position and wiring in cortical layers, etc.
In vivo measurement techniques at the macroscale offer information about individual brains, whereas measurements at the microscale are more specific to cell membranes and structures but cannot sample an entire individual brain.
The concept of The Virtual Brain addresses both scales: on the one hand, the structural connectivity of the whole brain is the scaffold of The Virtual Brain, and, on the other hand, the characteristics on the neural level are represented in the local dynamic models and their biophysiological parameters (e.g., the Jansen-Rit model).
Modeling the large-scale brain alone may not comprise microscopical elements, as well as modeling the entire brain based on every single neuron may be computationally infeasible.
For this reason, the mesoscale has been established
First, the direct electromagnetic fields between neighboring regions directly influence each other.
In addition, neural masses, which can cover the anatomical extent of a functional region or cover the neural mass in a voxel sampled by an MRI scanner.
Depending on the neural mass model, they can refer to excitatory and inhibitory populations interacting with each other and through the large-scale network, the connectome, with distant regions.
The interplay of this local circuitry in the large-scale brain network can produce physiologically plausible brain activity on a large scale
The prospect of The Virtual Brain as an interdisciplinary research framework is that clinical applications and ensuing technologies may benefit and build on theoretical and computational predictions, as it has already shown success in epileptic surgery
The Virtual Brain has already been used in a wide range of research topics, from the modeling of physiological brain phenomena in healthy participants
A study by Zimmermann et al. modeled AD using The Virtual Brain
By fitting the model to predict individual functional connectivity from the underlying structural connectivity, the authors could show a significant correlation between the cognitive state of AD patients and the fitted model parameters of The Virtual Brain
As the parameters are surrogates of biophysically relevant entities such as long-range coupling factors and local interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations, this enables the non-invasive estimation of intrinsic brain features.
For the field of AD, multimodal data could include, e.g., anatomical MRI, the structural connectivity out of diffusion tensor imaging, and PET imaging data of Glucose metabolism, Amyloid, and Tau.
Our previous study
As a pilot study in the field of molecular-driven large-scale brain simulations, we modeled local Abeta-mediated hyperexcitability using brain network modeling with The Virtual Brain, where regional Abeta burden was derived from PET data.
By defining the local excitation-inhibition balance as a function of local Abeta burden from PET, fundamental differences between the AD patients and controls were observed.
We showed that a few regions with moderate or high Abeta burden are transferred into an altered dynamic state, wherein their activity oscillations slowed down.
This slowing is mainly presented as a shift from alpha to theta rhythm.
It was propagated throughout the network and focused on the hubs.
Interestingly, local hyperexcitation took also place in the central parts of the network.
Therefore, with this approach, we were able to reveal a possible pathomechanism behind electroencephalographic slowing in AD

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although our knowledge about the contributing factors in AD pathogenesis grows, it is still a major challenge in neuroscience to understand their distinct meaning and interaction.
Moreover, the translation to clinical research is lagging behind.
Rather than exploring isolated mechanisms, the goal should be to integrate multiscale datasets to reveal complex interactions underlying AD
The main reasons for the development of precise and early diagnosis tools for AD can be summarized as follows:
1. Future treatments.
When a disease-modifying treatment for degenerative dementia will be available, it probably needs to be performed many years before the clinical and behavioral manifestation of the disease.
This is because pathway changes in the brain begin decades before the onset of dementia and lead to irreversible neuronal death.
However, one has to expect that such a treatment has to be taken for many years and might have severe adverse reactions.
Therefore, high sensitivity for the screening and high specificity of the diagnosis will be of crucial importance.
Moreover, future trends of personalized treatments can only be performed with personalized biomarker-profiled patient 'fingerprints'.

And if patients also have Parkinson's disease-do they then necessarily have so-called Parkinson's dementia?
Or do they suffer from AD and Parkinson's disease at the same time?
Or has the neurodegeneration caused by Parkinson's disease diminished the cognitive reserve, which leads to the clinical onset of AD? Unlike the original NINCDS-ADRDA classification, the current 2018 National Institute of Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) diagnostic definition is based on the presence of Abeta and Tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid or positron emission tomography (PET) and atrophy indicating neurodegeneration in brain imaging.
The NIA-AA definition introduces the so-called AT(N) classification to standardize biomarker findings in AD: therein A stands for positive Abeta biomarkers, T for phospho-Tau biomarkers, and N for Neurodegeneration markers in cerebrospinal fluid (total Tau burden) or atrophy shown in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
