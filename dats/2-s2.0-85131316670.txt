Faulty autolysosome acidification in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models induces autophagic build-up of Aβ in neurons, yielding senile plaques
A utophagy is the principal pathway for lysosomal degradation, maintaining cellular homeostasis by constitutively turning over obsolete proteins and organelles.
It is induced further by disease and cell stress to eliminate abnormal proteins, aggregates and damaged organelles
Autophagy encompasses several mechanisms for sequestering substrates and their delivery to lysosomes (LYs).
In the major autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), macroautophagy, an elongating double membrane envelops cytoplasm or, via adaptor protein, engages specific targeted substrates and then closes to form an autophagosome (AP).
APs mature to autolysosomes (ALs) upon fusion with LY or endolysosome, which introduces varied cathepsin proteases, other acid hydrolases and vATPase, the proton pump that acidifies AL lumens and activates the hydrolases.
LYs are targets of causative gene products and risk factors for AD
AD is defined neuropathologically by two lesions: intracellular tau aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles) and neuritic plaques composed of focally swollen (dystrophic) neurites (DNs)
Additionally, AVs containing incompletely digested autophagy substrates accumulate progressively within affected neurons at the earliest disease stage
The molecular basis for autophagy dysfunction in AD, its relationship to APP/amyloid pathology and its pathogenic implications are unclear due, in part, to technical challenges of monitoring ALP abnormalities in vivo in brain.
To overcome these limitations, we generated transgenic mice (TRGL) with neuron-specific expression of tandem fluorescence-tagged LC3 (mRFP-eGFP-LC3 or tfLC3), an autophagy adaptor protein selectively associated with AP and AL
The tfLC3 probe enabled us to investigate individual vesicular components of the neuronal ALP in intact brain and, to our knowledge for the first time, assess AL acidification ratiometrically in neurons throughout disease progression in mouse AD models.
To identify and monitor AD-related ALP deficits, we crossed TRGL and AD model mice that develop either early-onset or late-onset disease pathology.
In all five AD mouse models studied, we demonstrated early-appearing deficiencies of lysosomal vATPase activity, autophagy dysfunction in vulnerable neuron populations and accumulation of APP-βCTF and Aβ selectively within poorly acidified AL (pa-AL) well before extracellular β-amyloid deposition.
Furthermore, we identified a unique autophagic stress response in more compromised neurons characterized by fulminant proliferation of AVs within perikarya and formation of large membrane blebs packed with Aβ/APP-βCTF-filled AVs.
The strongly fluorescent petal-like blebs surrounding a DAPI-positive fluorescent nucleus generate flower-like profiles that we term 'PANTHOS' (poisonous flower).
Notably, AV fusion with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) yields intraluminal formation of β-amyloid fibrils in a tubular network surrounding the nucleus, yielding morphologic features of a cored amyloid plaque within the intact neuron.
Using an extensive Autophagy is markedly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Here we reveal unique autophagy dysregulation within neurons in five AD mouse models in vivo and identify its basis using a neuron-specific transgenic mRFP-eGFP-LC3 probe of autophagy and pH, multiplex confocal imaging and correlative light electron microscopy.
Autolysosome acidification declines in neurons well before extracellular amyloid deposition, associated with markedly lowered vATPase activity and build-up of Aβ/APP-βCTF selectively within enlarged de-acidified autolysosomes.
In more compromised yet still intact neurons, profuse Aβ-positive autophagic vacuoles (AVs) pack into large membrane blebs forming flower-like perikaryal rosettes.
This unique pattern, termed PANTHOS (poisonous anthos (flower)), is also present in AD brains.
Additional AVs coalesce into peri-nuclear networks of membrane tubules where fibrillar β-amyloid accumulates intraluminally.
Lysosomal membrane permeabilization, cathepsin release and lysosomal cell death ensue, accompanied by microglial invasion.
Quantitative analyses confirm that individual neurons exhibiting PANTHOS are the principal source of senile plaques in amyloid precursor protein AD models.

A tandem mRFP-eGFP-LC3 transgene (tfLC3) driven by the THY-1 promoter is postnatally expressed specifically in neurons.
tfLC3 is expressed approximately one-fold higher than endogenous LC3 levels and has no detectable effects on the ALP
Like endogenous LC3, tfLC3 binds to AP membranes and persists after AP-LY fusion as an internalized substrate degraded within AL, ultimately yielding non-fluorescent LYs.
The tfLC3 on AP fluoresces yellow-green (eGFP/mRFP) at the neutral pH of AP, but AL maturation upon fusion with LY

LYs after autophagic clearance of fluorescent LC3 or after new LY biogenesis can be visualized by immunohistofluorescence (IHF) labeling with LY markers (for example, cathepsin D (CTSD) or LAMP 2) tagged with a third fluorophore.
Notably, this third fluorophore also differentiates the yellow-fluorescing AP from an AP that fuses with an LY and is cathepsin-positive but fails to acidify adequately and, thus, fluoresces yellow by tfLC3 labeling alone (Fig.
The latter profile is classified as a pa-AL.
AP maturation and acidification are most easily appreciated when the transition from AP to AL is protracted during retrograde axonal transport in primary neuronal cultures of TRGL mice (Fig.
AVs are much fewer in vivo in the intact mature brain
Fully acidified AL is concentrated within perikarya and proximal dendrites in neurons (Fig.
ALs fluoresce purple (combined red and blue) in a three-fluorophore (RGB) analysis of neocortical perikarya, reflecting an efficient perikaryal acidification mechanism (Fig.
To model an AL/LY acidification deficit in vivo and validate the tfLC3 probe in intact brain in vivo, 6-month-old TRGL mice were administered the amphiphilic weak base chloroquine (CQ) or the vehicle alone (controls) by intraventricular infusion for 5 days, and neurons in neocortical layers III-V were imaged (Fig.
A rise in vesicle pH above 6.0 causes tfLC3-positive puncta to fluoresce yellow.
Based on a green/red channel merge alone, these puncta would be mis-identified as AP; however, IHF with a CTSD antibody and Alexa Fluor 647 (pseudo-blue) secondary antibody identifies these puncta as CTSD-positive and, therefore, as pa-AL.
In a three-channel merge, they fluoresce white (green, red and blue fluorescence) (Fig.
LYs remain blue after CQ, reflecting their pH-insensitive detection by IHF (Fig.

ALP patterns in 1.6-month-old Tg2576/TRGL crosses were indistinguishable from single-TRGL littermates (Extended Data Fig.
CTSD co-labeling revealed that the yellow AVs are exclusively CTSD-positive and, therefore, pa-ALs (Fig.
pa-AL was also positive for CTSB and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 (Extended Data Fig.

By 12 months, perikaryal pa-ALs further increased in Tg2576/TRGL (17.2 ± 0.7 per neuronal cross-section) (Fig.
To further document AL acidification deficits in Tg2576 brain, we isolated AL/LY-enriched fractions by OptiPrep density centrifugation (Extended Data Fig.
Consistent with observed pH deficits, vATPase activity in LY/AL of 6-month-old Tg2576 was decreased (65.6 ± 4.1%) compared to that of age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates (Fig.
ATPase activity was similarly reduced in brains from two other mouse models of AD (5xFAD and APP51) (Extended Data Fig.
The time course graph indicates age-dependent increased prevalence of pa-AL while vATPase activity declines (Fig.

APP-βCTF/Aβ accumulate in pa-AL at early stages of disease.
APP-βCTF and Aβ accumulate intracellularly before β-amyloid is deposited extracellularly in AD, with the endosomal-lysosomal system representing the main subcellular site for their generation
To relate APP-βCTF/Aβ intracellular accumulation to early AL acidification deficits in Tg2576 mice, we localized APP metabolites within AV subtypes using a monoclonal antibody (JRF/AβN/25) that detects APP-βCTF and Aβ
By 5 months, 40% of layer III-V neocortical perikarya in Tg2576/TRGL mice contained Aβ/APP-βCTF-positive puncta (Fig.
Immunoblot analyses on subcellular fractions from Tg2576 brains confirmed that LC3-II enriched AV fractions contain abundant APP-βCTF as well as γ-secretase components (presenilin 1 and nicastrin) (Fig.
Aβ localization in AVs was further validated by Aβ1-42 antibody (JRF/cAβ42/26) (Extended Data Fig.
Also, APP-βCTF localization in AVs was further validated by an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) using a modified Duolink technology (Methods) involving two primary antibodies directed against different epitopes (N-terminus or C-terminus) on APP-βCTF (Fig.
PLA fluorescence (red) detected APP-βCTF in APPswe-overexpressing N2A cells and Tg2576 neurons at considerably higher levels than in controls (Fig.
Notably, PLA signal (blue) revealed that APP-βCTF selectively accumulated in ALs that were poorly acidified in Tg2576/TRGL perikarya (92.9 ± 1.3%, n = 50 neurons) (Fig.
Progressively compromised neurons massively accumulate pa-AL.
In 10-month-old Tg2576/TRGL mice, a subpopulation of neocortical neurons (layer III-V) began to accumulate substantially enlarged pa-ALs, which bulge the plasma membrane outward (Fig.
The further massive proliferation of LC3-positive vesicles was accompanied by formation of large strongly fluorescent membrane blebs that project from the plasma membrane and expand perikaryal circumference.

of the perikaryon (Fig.
Electron microscopy (EM) analysis on brains of 5xFAD/TRGL mice confirmed the continuity of blebs with the perikaryal cytoplasm and identified AVs as the principal constituents within blebs (Fig.
Perikaryal blebs exhibit long membrane-bound necks extending from the soma of the PANTHOS neuron (Fig.
Additional features of PANTHOS neurons at higher EM resolution include a centrally located electron-dense network of radiating membrane-bound tubular extensions containing partially fused and fully incorporated AVs (Fig.
In other EM images, AVs and Aβ-positive fiber-containing tubular extensions are seen to be in the process of fusing (Fig.
EM analysis of brain sections labeled histochemically for the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase (ACPase) further confirmed the identity of most AVs in blebs as strongly ACPase-positive ALs, including those within the tapered bleb necks connecting blebs to the cytoplasm of the degenerating perikaryon (Fig.
Although the asymmetric morphology of perikaryal blebs and their evident cytoplasmic origin distinguish them from DNs, blebs were further distinguished from DNs, which are enriched with neurofilaments, exhibit weak signal for lysosomal markers (CTSD and LAMP2) as shown by IHF (Extended Data Fig.
To further establish the perikaryal origin of the many AV-filled blebbing profiles, we performed correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) together with serial block-face scanning EM imaging using an Apreo scanning electron microscope.
Reconstruction of more than 500 z-plane images recreated the entire PANTHOS neuron in three dimensions (Supplementary Fig.

The DAPI-positive center area of PANTHOS neurons approximates the sizes of the electron-dense centrally located areas in the stacked EM image (Fig.
ImmunoEM analyses with the nuclear marker KDM1/LSD1 confirmed the existence of nuclear remnants in the central area by detecting strong immunoreactivity in the same central area even after nuclear integrity was extensively disrupted (Extended Data Fig.
A movie sequence through these serial sections clearly visualized dozens of AV-filled membrane blebs arising within the cytoplasm from tapered necks that expand into large bulbous projections (blebs) from the perikaryon (Supplementary Movie 1), as shown in a colorized section from the full set (Fig.
A 3D reconstruction modeling illustrates the extensive blebbing of the perikaryon (Fig.

PANTHOS neurons are the principal origin of amyloid plaques.
In 5xFAD/TRGL mice, Aβ and APP-βCTF accumulate selectively within pa-ALs before β-amyloid plaques appear (Fig.
Transition of neurons to a PANTHOS pattern is accompanied by robust accretion of perinuclear Aβ/APP-βCTF immunoreactivity.
Co-labeling of these PANTHOS neurons with DAPI and anti-β-amyloid antibody (4G8) identified a 4G8-positive corona surrounding a DAPI-positive nucleus remnant at the center of most affected perikarya (Fig.
The progression of PANTHOS formation with respect to β-amyloid accretion was further confirmed in the late-onset AD mouse model APP51 (Extended Data Fig.
In 5xFAD/TRGL mice, quantitative spectral analysis of the PANTHOS neuron's central area discriminated DAPI fluorescence from fluorescence due to 4G8 immunolabeling (Fig.
At more advanced stages of PANTHOS, DAPI fluorescence gradually disappears as more β-amyloid accumulates centrally (Extended Data Fig.
Ultrastructural and 3D6 immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) analyses localized this central accretion of Aβ immunoreactivity (Fig.
Within many of these same profiles, 3D6-positive bundles of fibrils, with widths of around 10 nm, approximated the known diameters of fibrillar β-amyloid
Resembling the PANTHOS morphologies in Fig.
Perikaryal AVs were also shown to be continuous with, and incorporated into, the central Aβ-positive network of membrane tubular structures (Fig.
IEM with antibodies to either LC3 or CTSD confirmed that these vacuoles are AVs (Extended Data Fig.
ER, a key source for AP membrane components, is increasingly mobilized to supply membrane for new APs as autophagy induction in AD brain remains high
However, as accumulating AVs deplete sources of available membrane, APP-rich ER and Golgi membranes join endosomes as major sources of APP-βCTF/Aβ generation.
Therefore, ER and Golgi are likely key contributors to the expansion of the amyloid fibril network, supporting AP/AL formation by contributing both membrane and β-amyloid precursor.
Consistent with PANTHOS being the principal source of amyloid plaques, immunolabeling of β-amyloid with 3D6 in 5xFAD/ TRGL mice revealed an exclusive co-incidence and a one-to-one quantitative relationship between individual PANTHOS neurons and individual amyloid plaques (Fig.

invasion and advanced neurodegeneration.
This percentage is likely an underestimate because immunoEM analyses with the nuclear marker KDM1/LSD1 revealed nuclear remnants even after loss of nuclear integrity (Extended Data Fig.
The temporal and 1:1 spatial relationship among PANTHOS, intracellular perinuclear Aβ accretion and amyloid plaque formation, therefore, indicates that the vast majority of amyloid plaques originate from a corresponding individual PANTHOS neuron.
The transition from intact nucleated PANTHOS neurons to the more advanced stage of DAPI disappearance with glial invasion of the cell likely represents the loss of cellular integrity and conversion to an extracellular plaque.

Lysosomal permeabilization promotes neuronal cell death.

PANTHOS neurons evolve into senile plaques in AD models.
To characterize the evolution of PANTHOS neuron lesions into mature plaques, we immunolabeled PANTHOS with Thioflavin S (Thio-S) for the detection of dense-cored senile plaques (Fig.
In quantitative analyses of 5xFAD/ TRGL at 2.2 months of age, half of the PANTHOS profiles were Thio-S-positive, whereas, in 6-month-old 5xFAD/TRGL mice, more than 95% were Thio-S-positive (Fig.
To further characterize the evolution of PANTHOS neuron lesions into mature plaques, we immunolabeled reactive astrocytes and microglia.
Neither glial cell type was frequently associated initially with PANTHOS neurons, and, therefore, these cells were unlikely to be a major triggering factor in PANTHOS development.
In quantitative analyses of 5xFAD/TRGL at 2.7 months of age, most PANTHOS neurons were unengaged by microglia or astrocytes (Fig.
In older 5xFAD/TRGL mice (6 months), when greater numbers of PANTHOS neurons exhibited advanced loss of structural integrity, relatively few affected neurons were unengaged by microglia and astrocytes (Fig.
In older 5xFAD mice, PANTHOS lesions frequently expanded into larger senile plaques when adjacent PANTHOS neurons merged into a single larger structure (Fig.
Within these growing lesions, newly recruited PANTHOS neurons could still be recognized (Extended Data Fig.

Discussion
Our transgenic dual-fluorescence probe, identifying autophagic compartments and associated changes in their pH in vivo, established that autophagy failure in five different APP-AD mouse models originates from an early decline of AL/LY acidification.
Furthermore, we uncovered a previously undescribed pattern of extreme autophagic stress, termed PANTHOS, in individual neuronal perikarya, which is characterized by massive perikaryal accumulations of poorly acidified AVs containing APP-βCTF/ Aβ.
The advance of PANTHOS generates an intraneuronal perinuclear 'core' of β-amyloid within membrane tubules.
Preliminary analyses of human AD brain (Extended Data Fig.
Progressive failure of an initially neuroprotective autophagy response in neurons
AL acidification deficits in Tg2576 mice were detectable by 5 months of age-more than 4 months before β-amyloid deposited extracellularly.
The emergence of pH deficits in AL coincided with lowered vATPase activity in brain LYs-the likely molecular basis for the acidification deficit.
Declining AL acidification was accompanied by selective build-up of APP-βCTF and Aβ within enlarged pa-ALs.
These APP metabolites are known to be both generated and degraded in ALs
We also cannot exclude additional delivery of APP-βCTF and Aβ to AL/LY through microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy
The exceptional resolution of our tfLC3 autophagy probe, combined with advanced ultrastructural and multiplex confocal imaging methods, enabled the recognition of a unique pathobiologic process ('PANTHOS') in intact neurons within vulnerable cell populations.
This morphologic pattern, not previously reported, to our knowledge, includes AV accumulation ('autophagic stress') so extreme that it induced huge AV-filled plasma membrane blebs and accelerated perinuclear accretion of Aβ and β-amyloid fibrils within tubulo-vesicular structures created, in part, through AV fusion.
Large AV-filled blebs were shown by CLEM and 3D serial ultrastructural analyses to be formed by plasma membrane evagination and to originate from the perikaryal cytoplasm.
Their asymmetric morphology, high hydrolase content and extensive distribution encircling an affected perikaryon far outnumbered DNs.
Unlike perikaryal blebs, DNs were commonly enriched Fig.

with these disorders usually do not survive to mid-adult ages may partly explain the infrequency of amyloid plaques.
Even individuals with AD due to PSEN1 mutations generally do not develop amyloid plaque pathology until the fourth decade of life, when aging factors may contribute
Also, neuronal ALP induction continues to increase in AD brain even as substrate clearance declines
PANTHOS neurons account quantitatively for the overwhelming majority of plaques that developed in five different AD models at the ages studied.
In young 5xFAD mice, β-amyloid cored plaques, detected with β-amyloid antibodies, showed nearly 1:1 coincidence with a single PANTHOS neuron exhibiting a central nucleus.
Even at a relatively late stage of compromise, intracellular Aβ-immunoreactive fibrils forming a perinuclear core are mainly contained within membrane-bound tubular structures derived from fusion of Aβ-positive ALs.
This stage can be reached without appreciable microglial or astrocytic invasion that would reflect 'eat me' signaling from dying neurons
Subsequent microglial and astrocytic invasion of the PANTHOS neuron heralds the eventual cell death that converts this amyloid lesion within an intact neuron into an extracellular amyloid plaque.
β-amyloid plaque formation in AD has commonly been considered to originate from extracellular deposition of β-amyloid derived from secreted Aβ, which then triggers secondary neuritic dystrophy and neuronal cell death.
By contrast, our evidence in diverse AD models supports the opposite sequence-namely, extracellular plaques mainly evolve from intraneuronal build-up of β-amyloid within membrane tubules, forming a centralized amyloid 'core' within single intact PANTHOS neurons that subsequently degenerate to give rise to the classical senile plaque.
This 'inside-out' process accords with and substantiates hypotheses from many investigators
In versions of this hypothesis, Aβ and its oligomeric species generated intracellularly within ALP compartments can gain access to the extracellular space by neurodegeneration, local membrane damage or unconventional secretion (exocytosis).
Importantly, a few investigators have described intracellular membrane-enclosed amyloid fibrils in AD mouse models
Our findings add to mounting evidence that lysosomal acidification and the dysregulation of the vATPase complex are common targets of genetic and metabolic disruptions associated with neurodegenerative disease
Coupled with previous evidence
Notably, remediating PSEN1-related lysosomal pH deficits by various means ameliorates autophagy failure and other AD-related pathology in AD models
Additional supporting evidence from our group shows that the PANTHOS cascade in APP-based AD models described in this report can be significantly alleviated by pharmacologically targeting the lysosomal pH deficit.
Beyond the significance of findings revealed here, we anticipate broad potential of our transgenic dual-fluorescence tfLC3 autophagy probe to characterize ALP changes sensitively over time in other neurodegenerative disease models and to facilitate assessment of autophagy/lysosome modulators as therapeutic agents.

Ratiometric analysis of AL and AP acidity.
Procedures were performed as previously described
Confocal images were analyzed with the Zen Blue Image Analysis Module from Carl Zeiss Microscopy.
The R, G and B intensity values of each vesicle were calculated using the profile function of Zen.
The RGB ratio of each vesicle was converted into a hue angle and saturation range by entering the values of R, G and B for a given puncta into the formula as follows:
). Saturation percent of the hue angle was calculated by entering the values of R, G and B for a given puncta into the following formula = (MAX(RGB) -MIN(RGB)) / SUM(MAX(RGB) + MIN(RGB))×100, provided lightness is less than 1, which is the usual case for our data.
Hue angle was converted to color using the hue color wheel.

Subcellular fractionation, gel electrophoresis and western blotting. AV prep:
Procedures were performed as previously described
For each mouse genotype, cerebral cortices from five or more brains were pooled.
The samples were homogenized and subjected to differential centrifugation to separate a fraction enriched in AVs, LYs and mitochondria as previously described.
The different organelles in this fraction were isolated by floatation in a discontinuous gradient of metrizamide (50%, 26%, 24%, 20% and 10%), and the LY-enriched fraction was recovered in the 24-16% interface.
A fraction enriched in ER resealed vesicles (microsomes), and the cytosolic fraction was obtained in the pellet and supernatant, respectively, after centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000g for 1 hour.
Cytosol and membrane/vesicle prep: Cerebral cortices from male 5xFAD and WT mouse brain were homogenized with buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 with 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2 and protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche)).
The post-nuclear homogenates obtained by centrifugation (1,000g, 10 minutes) were further fractionated into cytosolic and membrane/vesicle fractions by high-speed centrifugation (150,000g, 50 minutes), and equal proteins were loaded on a gel.
Samples were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer and incubated for 5 minutes at 100 °C.
After electrophoresis on a 4-20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Invitrogen), proteins were transferred onto 0.45-µm PVDF membranes (Millipore) for detection of all other proteins and then incubated overnight in primary antibody.
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was added the next morning and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.
The blot was developed using an Invitrogen ECL kit.
vATPase activity assay.
AD transgenic mice were studied at the indicated age point together with WT or TRGL littermates as a control.
Mouse hemi-brain was homogenized in 10× volume of homogenization buffer by 40 strokes in a Teflon-coated pestle.
Lysates were centrifuged at 1,000g for 20 minutes to generate the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS).
The PNS was then adjusted to 25% OptiPrep (Sigma-Aldrich, D1556) with 50% OptiPrep in HB.
The resulting mixture, 2 ml in 25% OptiPrep, was placed at the bottom of a clear ultracentrifuge tube (14 × 95 mm, Beckman Coulter) and was overlaid successively with 1.5 ml each of 20%, 15%, 14%, 12.5%, 10% and 5% OptiPrep in cold HB.
The gradients were centrifuged for 18 hours at 100,000g at 4 °C in an SW 40 rotor (Beckman Coulter).
Next, 500-μl fractions were collected from the top of the ultracentrifuge tubes and analyzed by WB analysis.
LY-enriched fractions (mixture of 20 μl of each OptiPrep fraction from 15 to 18) were mixed with 0.052% NaN 3 for blocking the mitochondrial ATPase activity.
The vATPase activity was measured using the ATPase Assay Kit (Innova Biosciences, 601-0120) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Control samples were measured in the presence of the vATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (1 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich, C9705), and the experimental values were subtracted accordingly.
Absorbance was measured at 650 nm, and solutions of P i were used to generate a standard curve.
Ultrastructural EM analyses.
Mice were perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences).
Brains were removed and sectioned using a vibratome into 50-µm or 100-µm sections and placed in fixative solution and stored at 4 °C.
Samples were then treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 for 30 minutes, washed in distilled water four times (10 minutes per wash) and then treated with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight at 4 °C in the dark.
Samples were then washed and sequentially dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol (20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%) for 30 minutes each, followed by three additional treatments with 100% ethanol for 20 minutes each.
Samples were then infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Spurr's resin (25% for 1 hour, 50% for 1 hour, 75% for 1 hour, 100% for 1 hour and 100% overnight at room temperature) and then incubated overnight at 70 °C in a resin mold.
For transmission electron microscopy ultrastructural analysis, 70-nm sections were cut using a Leica Reichert Ultracut S ultramicrotome and a Diatome diamond knife, placed onto grids and then post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Images were taken using a Ceta camera on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Talos L120C transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV.
For the 100-µm-thick embedded samples for serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a diamond wire saw was used to remove excess resin around the embedded tissue.
The trimmed block was then glued to a VolumeScope specific SEM stub (Agar Scientific, AGG1092450) using a two-part silver conductive epoxy (Ted Pella, H20E EPO-TEK).
The sample was further trimmed down to a block face of 1,000 µm × 900 µm and 400 µm deep using an ultramicrotome.
Only the slides of the block were sputter coated with a 30-nm-thick layer of gold, as the bottom of the block was already mounted to the stub with the silver conductive epoxy before gold coating, and the top of the block was covered during the coating process.
The final prepared sample was imaged using an Apreo scanning electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a VolumeScope module for serial block-face imaging operating in low vacuum mode at 50 Pa using a pole piece mounted backscatter detector, VS-DBS.
The brain tissue (M-A) dataset was acquired using an accelerating voltage of 2 kV and a beam current of 100 pA.

Statistics and reproducibility.
Statistical parameters, including the definitions and value of sample size (n), deviations and P values, are reported in the figures and corresponding figure legends.
Statistical analyses using Prism 8 (GraphPad) were conducted on data originating from at least three independent experimental replicates.
Statistical analyses between two groups were performed by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test.
Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.
Differences were considered significant with P < 0.05.
Depending on the data analysis, sample size related to number of animals was determined by the standards accepted in the field.
No specific statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but sample size was determined based on experience from previous studies
Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested.
The samples were not blinded during initial planning because we wanted to ensure that the number of WT and AD mouse models was balanced and age and sex were matched.
The mice were then randomly assorted for the studies, and the investigators were blinded when doing the experiments and running data analyses.

Extended Data Fig.
Normal autophagic clearance involves substrate sequestration into a double-membrane autophagosome (AP) followed by fusion with lysosomes (LY), yielding a single-membrane autolysosome (AL).
The proton pump vATPase maintains an acidic pH (4.5-5) optimal for lysosomal enzymatic activity and degradation of substrates within AL, which then convert to lysosomes to restore normal levels of free LY.
In Alzheimer's disease, three main stages of neuronal compromise and degeneration resulting from autophagy-lysosomal pathway dysfunction can be identified: i) the "budding" stage of PANtHoS: AL acidification deficiency and poorly acidified-AL build-up.
AD-gene driven deficits of Ly vATPase activity underlie impaired clearance of autophagic substrates, including APP-βCTF/Aβ (mainly derived from the endolysosomal pathway).
The result is an accumulation of enlarged poorly acidified AL (pa-AL) within the neuronal perikaryon well before the appearance of any other overt AD-related pathology.
Buildup of pa-AL containing APP-βCTF/Aβ is accompanied by their progressive peripheralization resulting in plasma membrane distortion and bulging/budding (see Fig.

; Fig.4aand Fig.6a).
ii) the "flowering" stage of PANtHoS: formation of perinuclear membrane-bound amyloid fibers.
Massive buildup of APP-βCTF/ Aβ-containing pa-AL induces a unique pattern of perikaryal membrane blebbing.
The blebs, corresponding to the "petals" of the PANTHOS neuron, have tapered necks extending toward the plasma membrane-surface of the PANTHOS neuron containing a degenerating condensed nucleus (see Fig.4a-e; Fig.5aand Fig.6b-c).
β-amyloid (Aβ) fiber bundles within a branching membrane tubular network accumulate around a deteriorating nucleus and reflect the fusion of AVs with APP-rich endoplasmic reticulum (eR).
The enlarged inset shows AVs at different stages of fusion (see Fig.5c,dand Fig.6d,e).
Accrual of Aβ and other oxidized substrates initiates Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization (LMP) and LY enzyme leakage.
iii) the "overblown" stage of PANtHoS: amyloid plaque expansion via glial invasion and recruitment of neighboring PANtHoS neurons.
As nuclear membrane is disrupted and the nucleus degenerates, amyloid fiber growth within the expanding perinuclear membrane-tubular network, completely invades the center of the PANTHOS neuron incorporating additional AVs (see Fig.5c; extended Data Fig.5eand Fig.6e).
LY enzyme leakage, along with focal rupture of perikaryal and bleb plasma membrane, trigger an inflammatory response and signals that recruit phagocytic glial cells and promotes the coalescence of individual PANTHOS neurons, which expand the plaque lesion and central protease-resistant β-amyloid core (see Fig.7e,f and Fig.8a,b,c), transforming degenerating PANTHOS perikarya into an extracellular senile plaque.nature
