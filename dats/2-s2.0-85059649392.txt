PRENYLATED CURCUMIN ANALOGUES AS MULTIPOTENT TOOLS TO TACKLE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Alzheimer's disease is likely to be caused by copathogenic factors including aggregation of Aβ peptides into oligomers and fibrils, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
To date, no effective treatments are available and because of the multifactorial nature of the disease, it emerges the need to act on different and simultaneous fronts.
Despite the multiple biological activities ascribed to curcumin as neuroprotector, its poor bioavailability and toxicity limit the success in clinical outcomes.
To tackle Alzheimer's disease on these aspects, the curcumin template was suitably modified and a small set of analogues was attained.
In particular, derivative 1 turned out to be less toxic than curcumin.
As evidenced by capillary electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy studies, 1 proved to inhibit the formation of large toxic Aβ oligomers, by shifting the equilibrium towards smaller non-toxic assemblies and to limit the formation of insoluble fibrils.
These findings were supported by molecular docking and steered molecular dynamics simulations which confirmed the superior capacity of 1 to bind Aβ structures of different complexity.
Remarkably, 1 also showed in vitro anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.
In summary, the curcumin-based analogue 1 emerged as multipotent compound worth to be further investigated and exploited in the Alzheimer's disease multi-target context.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia 1 and despite impressive efforts, so far the set up of a successful anti-AD drug discovery strategy resulted extremely difficult, mainly because of the multifactorial nature of the disease
In the last years, numerous AD-modifying therapeutics failed clinical trials and, to date, only five drugs mainly targeting cholinesterases have been approved by Food and Drug Administration.
Compelling evidences consider extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposits in the brain as one of the main AD hallmarks
All these mechanisms, together with mithocondria and neurovascular dysfunctions, are mutually involved in a feed-forward loop, ultimately leading to progressive neurodegeneration
Aβ protein includes natively disordered peptides, ranging from 36 to 43 amino acids, that are produced from the sequential metabolism of amyloid precursor protein by β-and γ-secretases
Monomeric Aβ42 peptide is prone to self-assembly into oligomeric species, which aggregate to form protofibrils and then mature amyloid fibrils
Some well-defined Aβ peptide regions are involved in the aggregation process
The glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) binding site (HHQK) assists, via a α-helix intermediate, the conformational transition of monomers from normal random coil to β-sheet structure which is characterized by an increased tendency to aggregate into dimers and oligomers
The stabilization of the soluble Aβ monomers conformation, or the prevention of the α-to-β conformational transition, represent suitable strategies to avoid oligomers formation.
The self recognition hydrophobic core ( 16 KLVFFA
In particular, - stacking involving the two Phe residues may play a significant role in the self-assembly process.
The emerging -hypothesis suggests that drugs able to block these interactions may effectively control the amyloid diseases 10 .
After this primary lag step, spherical oligomers transform into larger aggregates (nucleation phase) and an equilibrium between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, involving Glu
Notably, in the last 25 years attention has been shifted from amyloid fibrils to soluble prefibrillar Aβ oligomers which, unlike other amyloidoses, are found to be more toxic than mature fibrils
Aβ42 oligomers bind to hippocampal neurons and hamper synaptic plasticity, manifested as inhibition of the long-term potentiation, which is involved in learning and memory
To date, it is not clear which particular oligomeric state is mainly involved in eliciting neurotoxic effects and by which specific mechanism.
Indeed, the transient and non-covalent nature makes it difficult their identification and characterization
On the other hand, also insoluble fibril deposits are found to be neurotoxic since, being in equilibrium with oligomers, they may serve as a reservoir and catalyze oligomer formation through secondary nucleation pathways.
Consequently, both oligomers and fibrils represent important targets.
In this scenario, a multitarget approach based on the simultaneous inhibition of some relevant AD targets offers promises to achieve a successful therapeutic outcome
Curcumin (Figure
The 4-hydroxy,3-methoxy-phenyl (vanillin) rings of curcumin were shown to adopt a correct position to establish π-π interactions with Phe
In addition, the curcumin coplanar rearrangement allows the intercalation between the Aβ fibrils, thus hampering the β-sheets assembly and in turn the fibrillation pathways
Nevertheless curcumin does not have success in clinical trials, due to its poor bioavailability and possible toxic effects, mainly ascribed to the 4-hydroxy,3-methoxy substitution pattern of the two aryl rings
Together with a large number of multipotent compounds such as quinones, cathecols, and isothiazolones, curcumin has been included among pan-assay interfering compounds (PAINS), since they can display apparent bioactivity and/or interfere with assay readouts
It is not definite whether compounds containing a PAINS-related sub-structure behave as reactive chemicals rather than selective drugs, indeed the reactivity of a compound or other effects might be also context-dependent
However, a number of curcumin-based compounds, when properly decorated, have been shown to exert significant biological activities
In this context, the key chemical features for an Aβ ligand have been identified to comprise two sterically bulky aromatic moieties, connected by a flexible linker of suitable length, to ensure their optimal spatial arrangement
The resulting elongated and flat molecule demonstrated to hamper the characteristic - stacking interactions between the aromatic residues of Aβ monomers, oligomers, or filaments
In order to identify multipotent AD disease-modifying drug candidates
Molecular docking and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were performed in order to assess the molecular recognition of the derivatives with either monomeric or aggregated Aβ42 and to assess the stability of the corresponding complexes which are responsible for the inhibitory activity.
The identification of probes able to modulate Aβ aggregation, inflammation and oxidative stress could allow to shed light into this cross-talk and represents a crucial issue in the AD drug discovery scenario.
Therefore, the most promising compounds in terms of anti-oligomeric and antifibrillogenic activity were also evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design and synthesis of curcumin analogues.
The aromatic 4-hydroxy,3-methoxy substitution patterns of curcumin (cur, Figure
This moiety, found in a large number of natural products, proved to be often associated to neuroprotective effects, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant, among others
This flexible mono-unsaturated function could also impart to the molecule an increased capability to establish hydrophobic contacts with Aβ monomers.
Furthermore, the importance of the hepta-1,4,6-trien-3-one central linker was studied by its proper simplification into a penta-1,4-dien-3-one, obtaining the corresponding compounds 3 and 4 (Figure
Since this structural modification has been successfully introduced in the design of curcumin derivatives with increased anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities
Indeed, the maintenance of the carbonyl α,β-unsaturated electrophile reactive centre, together with the length of the linker (6-19 Å) and its rigidity are some of the key chemical features required to effectively inhibit amyloid aggregation
Chemistry.
The synthetic route for the attainment of the target curcumin-based compounds (1-4) is outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared by two-consecutive steps, applying the Pabon reaction
Analogues 3 and 4 were synthesized through base-catalyzed Claisen-Schmidt procedure.
In the classical Pabon procedure pentane-2,4-dione was complexed with B2O3 in EtOAc to avoid the methylene-centred reactivity toward the Knoevenagel reaction and to favor the nucleophilic attack at the side methyl groups.
The boric complex was then condensed with the suitable aldehyde and then a step-wise addition of n-tributylborate and n-butylamine was carried out.
Acidic treatment caused the dissociation of the complex, providing the desired curcumin-based analogue.
This reaction has been reported to give the curcuminoid as β-keto-enol tautomer.
In the classical Claisen-Schmidt aldol condensation, acetone was reacted with the appropriate aldehyde in EtOH and in the presence of a 50% KOH/H2O solution.
In details, by condensing pentane-2,4-dione or acetone with two different selected aldehydes, namely 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin) and 4-(3,3-dimethylallyloxy)benzaldehyde, a mixture of the desired compounds could be obtained, among which the asymmetrical and the two symmetrical curcuminoids, including the semi-reaction products.
Consequently, obtaining the desired compounds in a good purity grade would require several chromatographic purifications.
To avoid this drawback, the synthesis of asymmetric curcumin analogues 1 and 3 (Scheme 1) was performed through two sequential steps, in which the semi-synthetic intermediates were first prepared reacting pentane-2,4dione and acetone with vanillin under the appropriate reaction condition to give 5 and 6, respectively.
Subsequently, a second reaction with 4-(3,3-dimethylallyloxy)benzaldehyde, allowed the attainment of the desired asymmetrical compounds.
In order to prepare the symmetrical analogues 2 and 4 (Scheme 2) a one-pot procedure, by using a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio for the ketone and the benzaldehyde, was performed.
The 4-(3,3-dimethylallyloxy)benzaldehyde (7) was obtained by exploiting a Williamson ether synthesis between 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 3,3-dimethylallybromide in the presence of K2CO3 as base.

Cell toxicity of curcumin and analogues.
In view of evaluating if the Aβ42 oligomers-induced toxicity is ameliorated in presence of the newly synthesized analogues (1-4), the intrinsic toxicity was assessed on neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and microglia cells by using cur as reference compound.
Cells were exposed to compound concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 µM for 24 hours or from 1 to 40 µM for 16 hours, respectively.
As shown in Figure
The di-prenoxylated derivatives 2 and 4 showed a significant and comparable profile, as toxic effects were observed at 5 µM concentration.
At high concentrations (20-50 µM), 3 considerably reduced cell viability, conversely, at concentrations ranging from 1-10 µM it was found to be not toxic, alike cur and 1.
Compound 2 exerted a similar effect on microglia cell viability, showing a cytotoxic activity from 1 µM concentration.
Interestingly, treatment of microglia with 1, even at 20 and 40 µM concentrations, did not significantly affect cell viability in comparison with vehicle-treated control cells, whereas the same concentrations of cur were cytotoxic (Figure
Inhibition of Aβ42 aggregation.
On the basis of the amyloid hypothesis, a variety of anti-amyloid agents have been developed over the years, with the aim of interfering either with Aβ peptides oligomerization or fibrillogenesis or with both events
Despite the efforts made, results are not yet encouraging.
The assays employed in in vitro aggregation studies show limitations in providing simultaneous and comparable information on both fibrils and oligomers, as well as among oligomers of different size.
As a consequence, it is clear that more than one technique has to be used, since a potential inhibitor of the oligomerization may not be identified by using a specific assay for fibrils
The evidence of fibril formation or inhibition is commonly given by well established techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence.
Conversely, the identification and characterization of soluble Aβ oligomers involved in the pathological cascade are extremely challenging; indeed to date, a specific oligomeric state to target is missing
In particular, the difficulties in obtaining well characterized Aβ oligomers in solution, as well as the dynamic equilibrium among oligomers which keep on aggregating during the in vitro experiments, represent important issues in the search for modulators of fibrillogenesis
In this context, it has been demonstrated that capillary electrophoresis (CE) can play an alternative role in the in vitro aggregation studies of Aβ peptides.
Since it works in free solution and in the absence of secondary equilibria, CE allows a real snapshot of Aβ while assembling into soluble oligomers inside the capillary, until sample precipitation
The use of CE to identify agents able to interfere with Aβ42 oligomerization has been pioneered by us and also reported by others
Furthermore, the combination of CE analysis of Aβ42 solutions in the presence of an anti-aggregating candidate with the TEM images of the final precipitate, provides integrated information on the anti-oligomerization and anti-fibrillogenesis activity
Anti-oligomeric activity.
In this work, we exploited one of the analytical platforms recently reported by us that were optimized and standardized to correlate aggregation state, structure and toxicity of Aβ42 oligomers separated by CE, in view of coincubation experiments
Before carrying out any analysis of an Aβ42 sample in the presence of an inhibitor of aggregation, the setup of a reproducible protocol for Aβ42 sample preparation and in turn of a reproducible CE separation of the prepared oligomers are mandatory prerequisites.
Aβ42 peptide aggregates and precipitates very rapidly, therefore to appreciate differences in oligomer formation kinetics or to detect reduction/abrogation of oligomer building-up by a coincubated compound, it is necessary to keep the assemblies in solution for a suitable time window.
Moreover, the toxicity of the oligomeric populations detected and separated by CE has to be known, for identifying the target species of the small molecules evaluated.
In particular, for observing the effect of coincubated molecules, the least aggregating sample preparation protocol was selected
Since cur and compounds 1-4 are soluble in pure ethanol, an adjustment of the original Aβ42 sample preparation protocol was necessary (see Experimental Section), to account for the percentage of ethanol in buffer when coincubating the peptide and the compounds.
The comparison of the CE profile and mobility values reported in
Therefore, precise peak identification, molecular weight range and toxicity of the separated oligomers can be considered the same.
Briefly, Figure
At late times from solubilization, large aggregates are the most abundant species, until insoluble fibrils are formed and no more soluble species are detected.
As small oligomers are not toxic
All coincubation studies were carried out in triplicate and electrophoretic traces were recorded for cur and all analogues, at different concentrations and at different elapsed times from sample redissolution.
Figure
All compounds show some activity, although it is clear that the asymmetrical hepta-1,4,6-trien-3-one-based analogue 1 turns out to be the most effective of the series in suppressing the building up of toxic oligomers, followed by cur and then 2, while the 1,4-dien-3one analogues 3 and 4 are remarkably less active.
Complete information on many time points from solubilization up to precipitation is reported in Figure
Based on these results, experiments have been performed at 10 µM compound concentration, focusing the attention on cur, 1 and 2, both endowed with the curcuminoid scaffold.
Figure
Electropherograms in Figures
The lower anti-aggregation activity of compound 2 (blue trace) could be partially ascribed at the lack of aromatic substituents capable of taking part in hydrogen bonding, which, conversely, are highly conserved in most amyloid ligands of natural origin
Complete evaluation at decreasing concentrations down to 1 µM is reported in Figure
Here the observations on the reduction of the toxic large oligomers (peak 3) can be summarized as follows: i) independently on the concentration tested, the symmetrical analogue 2 only slows down the formation of toxic oligomers, that are eventually formed as abundant as they are in the control sample; ii) both cur and 1 show concentration-dependent activity down to 1 µM (see also Figure
Figure
In particular, it is clear that dimers (peak 2) are always kept in solution for very long times, in comparison with Aβ42 control sample.
This effect is consistent with the stabilization of Aβ dimers induced by curcumin
Notably, from Figure
It can be summarized that CE data are consistent with the activity expected by virtue of the progressive structural modifications performed on 1.
In particular, the further substitution of the 4-hydroxy,3-methoxy group with the 4-prenyloxy (as for 2) and the simplification of the β-keto enol function (as for 3) result in a gradual decrease of the anti-oligomeric activity, that is lowest for 4, in which both modifications are combined.
The order of potency observed is 1>cur>2>3>4.
Anti-fibrillogenic activity.
Because of the intrinsic fluorescence of curcumin, ThT fluorescence assay is precluded
Conclusions are drawn on data obtained for three independent samples each one measured in duplicate.
As shown in Figure
Conversely to the control peptide and already after 24 hours, Aβ42 samples coincubated with cur or 1 contain amorphous aggregates only.
The absence of amyloid fibrils is kept at later stages of oligomerization (after 21 days).
This evidence can be correlated with the anti-oligomeric activity induced by both compounds relative to large oligomers (Figure
The sample containing cur eventually precipitates into dense amyloid fibrils.
This is not overly surprising, as also recent reports suggested that curcumin only inhibits oligomerization while promoting fibrillization
Contrary to samples coincubated with cur, only sporadic fibrils are detected in precipitated samples of Aβ42 in the presence of derivative 1. Surprisingly, compound 2 abrogates the formation of the fibrils observed after 24 hours, as only amorphous granular assemblies are detected at sample precipitation.
In accordance with the poor anti-oligomeric activity, both monocarbonyl derivatives (3 and 4) lead to amyloid fibrils already after 24 hours and as end products of the aggregation (Figure
As expected, the ligands approach the amyloid region corresponding to the above mentioned
In the computed complexes, the curcumin analogues assume slightly bent conformations which are in line with the curcumin geometries found in the resolved structures.
For instance, the curcumin molecule included in the resolved complex with human transthyretin (PDB Id: 4PMF) shows an angle, as defined by the central carbonyl and the two aromatic rings, of 107.87 while, in the here generated complex, the same angle of cur is equal to 106.99 (see Figure
Moreover and in all considered complexes, the β-keto-enol central core elicits H-bonds with Glu
The other interactions stabilized by the phenyl moieties depend on the polarity of the substituents.
Thus, cur, through a side vanillin group, elicits H-bonds with Gln 15 and Asn 27 , while asymmetrical analogue 1 retains the same polar contacts and, through its prenyloxy function, adds clear hydrophobic interactions with Ile 31 .
The diprenoxylated 2 loses the H-bond with Gln 15 and adds apolar contacts with Val
Both monocarbonyl analogues (3 and 4) lose the key polar interactions with Glu 22 (complexes not shown).
As depicted in Figure
14
While contacting the same well-known amyloid region, Figure
In particular, the ligands assume rather extended geometries by which they contact six different amyloid segments.
As seen for 1, the ligands contact the same residues of all involved segments: in detail, they elicit i) extended hydrophobic contacts with six Leu 18 residues which contact both phenyl ring and alkyl chains and ii) extended H-bonds with six Lys
Not to mention that these protonated residues can also stabilize charge-transfer interactions with the phenyl rings.
Taken together, one may observe that, while the ligands assume comparable poses in all simulated amyloid structures, the relevance of hydrophobic contacts increases when increasing the complexity of the simulated amyloid structure and finds its maximum expression with the fibril structure where the ligands are supported by a basis completely composed of apolar residues.
These observations suggest that the interaction with simple amyloid structures are enhanced by a fine balance between polar and apolar contacts as seen for 1 in the monomeric protein, while the interaction with complex amyloid structures appears to be strongly governed by hydrophobic contacts.
The described molecular docking results find encouraging validations by SMD simulations involving Aβ42 tetramers and fibrils and comparing 1 and 2 with cur.
In these simulations the ligand is forced to unbound from the Aβ42 structures and the required pulling force is monitored during the time.
As compiled in Table
A third relevant parameter is the AUC value of the plot limited to the residence time which accounts for both the total force and required time.
With regards to Aβ42 tetramers, Table
These results confirm that only a proper balance between polar and hydrophobic interactions is able to increase the stability of the complex with Aβ42 oligomers over the time.
In contrast and when simulating the fibrils, the ligands reveal rather similar values in all reported parameters.
This observation may indicate that the ligands are here similarly governed by the sole hydrophobic contacts and indeed the most apolar compound (2) shows the best force mean and AUC value.
All proposed compounds were submitted to SwissADME online web-server (

Evaluation of anti-inflammatory properties. The prenylation of aromatic natural products results in
derivatives with an improved pharmacological profile when compared with not-prenylated compounds and prenylated natural compounds proved to be useful for the treatment of cancer and inflammation
As this latter represents an important pathological condition in AD
Thus, the most promising compound 1 in terms of anti-oligomeric and anti-fibrillogenic activity, was selected to be tested for its anti-inflammatory properties, in comparison to cur.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and a potent immune activator of a variety of mammalian cell types, including microglia.
Inhibition of LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α by microglia was examined to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of analogue 1 and cur.
Microglia cells were exposed to non-cytotoxic concentrations of test compounds for 1 hour and then stimulated with LPS for 16 hours to induce an inflammatory response.
In unstimulated cells low or undetectable amounts of IL-1β and TNF-α were released and these basal levels remained unchanged after treatment with the tested compounds (white bars, Figure
As expected, LPS stimulation induced an increased release of IL-1β and TNF-α (taken as 100%).
Not only was this effect significantly suppressed by cur, as we previously showed

Evaluation of anti-oxidant properties.
In addition to the anti-inflammatory activity, we then investigated the potential of compounds 1 and 2 as antioxidants.
We evaluated in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells their scavenger ability when co-incubated with H2O2, using cur as reference.
In comparison to untreated cells, (grey line, Figure
Treatment with cur and compounds 1 and 2 reduced H2O2induced intracellular ROS production, albeit to a different extent.
At any time tested, cur showed the strongest scavenger activity when compared to analogues 1 and 2. In particular, the presence of both vanillin moieties (as for cur) appears to be important for this anti-oxidant activity.
Compound 2, lacking 4hydroxy,3-methoxy group on both aromatic rings, was less effective than compound 1, where one of the two vanillin functions of curcumin is preserved.
Further studies were carried out on the mechanism of action of 1 and 2 on the Nrf2 cellular pathway, for investigating their ability to modulate the expression of the Nrf2 transcription factor
Recent evidence further showed that Nrf2 activation suppresses inflammation through redox control
Therefore, we investigated the activation of Nrf2 pathway by analyzing its translocation into nucleus.
A concentration of 5 µM of cur and 1 induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, whereas 2 did not show to be an Nrf2-inducer.
The asymmetrical analogue 1, at the concentration of 10 μM, did not produce statistically significant results in our experimental setting, although we could assume an increasing trend as compared to control (Figure
These data suggest that 1 may modulate anti-oxidant response by acting through different pathways, besides Nrf2 activation.
Evidence from literature supports the ability of different natural products, including polyphenols in general, to interact with selected miRNAs, thus targeting multiple genes and showing pleiotropic activity
Hence, the differential Nrf2 activation by 10 μM 1 may be putatively related to the modulation of the levels of certain miRNAs associated with the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
On the basis of these observations, the investigation of miRNA modulation could potentially be important and will be next further evaluated to better understand the underlying anti-oxidant mechanism of natural products and their derivatives.

CONCLUSIONS
The curcumin scaffold was rationally modified and a small set of structurally related compounds was obtained and tested against Aβ42 oligomer and fibril formation, inflammation and oxidative stress, i.e. copathogenic factors related to AD.
To this aim, derivatives were obtained in which i) a prenyloxy function was introduced as substituent in one or both the cur side aryl functions, and ii) the cur keto-enol central linker was simplified.
Two couples of analogues 1-2, and 3-4, respectively were obtained.
The new compounds were firstly evaluated for their anti-amyloid effects, leading to identify cur and analogue 1, both endowed with the hepta-trien-3-one linker, as the most effective agents in slowing down the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers.
Interestingly, CE and TEM analyses showed how 1 potently inhibits oligomers building up and, contrary to cur, it does not lead to the formation of a dense network of fibrils.
Due to its remarkably lower toxicity on microglia cells if compared to 2 and even to cur, analogue 1 was then selected to investigate its anti-inflammatory effect on microglia activation.
In particular, at 5 µM concentration, a suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines release was detected.
This analogue also showed an anti-oxidant potential, with particular reference to the capability to induce, at 5 µM, Nrf2 nuclear translocation.
By contrast, the symmetrical curcuminoid 2, in comparison to 1, showed a remarkably weaker anti-oxidant activity and a lower efficacy in contrasting oligomer formation.
Notably, fibrils were not observed in presence of compound 2 and this suggests that the two prenyloxy substituents may serve as β-sheet breakers by intercalating in the amyloid fibrillar core.
The anti-amyloid effects of 1 and 2, compared to those of cur, were evidently corroborated by molecular docking and SMD simulations which revealed the growing role of the hydrophobic interactions when simulating Aβ structures of increasing complexity.
The simplified counterparts 3 and 4 failed to block both the formation of large Aβ assemblies and the deposition of fibrils.
Taken together, these data underlined the pivotal role of the curcumin scaffold in eliciting antiamilodogenic effects, in particular when both the 4-hydroxy,3-methoxy and prenyloxy aryl substitution patterns are present.
Indeed, among the newly synthesized compounds, 1 turned out to be a very promising anti-AD tool, endowed with a better biological profile with respect to cur.
Due to its multipotent behaviour it could be a lead compound, worthy further optimization to obtain effective AD-modifying drug candidates.

The negative staining was performed with 10 µL of 2%w/v uranyl acetate solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences).

Docking studies.
In order to rationalize the different activity of curcumin and the here proposed derivatives, molecular docking simulations were performed involving the resolved Aβ42 peptide (PDB Id: 1IYT), which was simulated in its monomeric, dimeric and tetrameric forms.
Calculations also included the resolved amyloid fibril (PDB Id: 2MXU).
The ligands were simulated in their keto-enolic form and their conformational space was explored by combining MonteCarlo simulations and PM7-based semi-empirical minimizations as previously described
In detail, the amyloid monomer was minimized by keeping fixed the backbone atoms to preserve the resolved folding and utilized to build the corresponding dimer by following the computational procedure as described by Rao and co-workers
Briefly, two optimized monomers were initially aligned at an average distance between the backbone atoms of the two monomers of about 10 Å and then the monomers were progressively approached and optimized to reach a final average distance of about 5 Å.
The resolved fibril structure underwent the same refinement protocol as described for monomer before docking simulations.
Thus, SMD simulations involved Aβ42 in its monomeric, dimeric and fibril forms and were performed by using PLANTS and by including the entire amyloid structure in its searches
For each simulated ligand, 20 poses were generated and ranked by ChemPLP score with a speed equal to 1.
All obtained poses were then minimized.
The best dimeric complexes were finally utilized to generate the corresponding tetramers by docking on them a second dimer structure.
Such a dimer-dimer docking was performed using PatchDock by adopting its default parameters and the so generated 20 docking results were finally refined by FireDock 51 .
The so produced best tetrameric complexes were finally minimized by keeping fixed the backbone atoms.
The computed tetrameric and fibril complexes for 1, 2 and cur were then neutralized and inserted into a 80 Å side box of water.
After a preliminary minimization, the systems underwent 3 ns SMD simulations with the same characteristics as described in
were rapidly decapitated, minimizing suffering, discomfort or stress.
Primary microglia cells were isolated from mixed glial cell cultures prepared from cerebral cortex, as previously described
Briefly, upon reaching confluence (7-10 days after isolation) microglia adhering to the astroglial monolayer were dislodged by shaking (200 r.p.m. for 1 h at 37°C), resuspended in high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 50 μg/mL gentamicin and plated on uncoated plastic wells at a density of 1.25 × 10 5 cells/cm 2 .
Cells were allowed to adhere for 45 min and then washed to remove non-adhering cells.
After a 24 h incubation period, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing the agents under study.
Purity of the cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using a primary polyclonal antibody against ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, 1:800, Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA, USA).
Ninety-seven per cent of the cells were Iba1 immunopositive.

Inhibition of cytokines release.
Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
Microglia were pre-treated for 1 hour with non-cytotoxic concentrations of cur and 1 and then stimulated with 100 ng/mL Ultra-Pure LPS-EB for an additional 16 hours.
At the end of incubation, culture medium was collected and the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α released by microglia were assayed using a commercially available ELISA kits (Antigenix America, Huntington Station, NY, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cytokine concentrations (pg/mL) in the medium were determined by reference to standard curves obtained with known amounts of IL-1β and TNF-α and the results expressed as percentage relative to LPS-stimulated cultures.
Data were analyzed using GraphPad software, version 3.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and expressed as mean ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments.
As raw values varied between experiments and the variability could obscure the treatment effect, data were expressed as percentage LPS treatment, taken as baseline of each independent experiment.
Data were analyzed by means of Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Dunn's test for multiple comparisons vs LPS treatment.
Significance level was set at p < 0.05.
