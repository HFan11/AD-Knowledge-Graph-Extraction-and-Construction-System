Novel inhibitors of AChE and Aβ aggregation with neuroprotective properties as lead compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
A series of sulfone analogs of donepezil were designed and synthesized as novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors with the potent inhibiting Aβ aggregation and providing neuroprotective effects as potential modalities for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Most of the target compounds displayed effective inhibition of AChE, especially compound 24r which displayed powerful inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.4 nM).
Kinetic and docking studies indicated that compound 24r was a mixed-type inhibitor.
Furthermore, in glyceraldehyde (GA)-exposed SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells, compound 24r could potently inhibit AChE, reduce tau phosphorylation at S396 residue, provide neuroprotection by rescuing neuronal morphology and increasing cell viability.
It was also found to reduce amyloid aggregation in the presence of AChE.
In addition, compound 24r showed evident protections from mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and oxidative stress in okadaic acid-induced pharmacological models.
Moreover, compound 24r exhibited more effective treatment prospects in vivo than donepezil, including a moderate bloodbrain barrier permeability, a more potent AChE inhibitory activity and behavioral improvement in scopolamine-induced cognition-impaired mice model at a much lower dose.
Collectively, compound 24r is a promising lead compound for further investigation to discovery and development of new anti-AD agents.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease
Clinically, patients with AD are characterized by a full spectrum of dementia manifestations from cognitive and behavioral impairment and other neurodegenerative symptoms
According to the World Alzheimer Report 2019, almost 80% of the general public are apprehensive of getting AD at some point, and a quarter think this disease not to be preventable
The pathogenesis of AD is complex and still not fully understood, but several hypotheses on the pathophysiology of AD have been proposed to facilitate drug development, including low levels of acetylcholine (ACh), amyloidβ (Aβ) deposits, tau protein aggregation, oxidative stress and dyshomeostasis of biometals
The cholinergic hypothesis was first proposed to explain the pathogenesis of AD and is relatively well accepted
This hypothesis indicates that the pathogenesis of AD, as well as the corresponding dysfunction, are related to decreased levels of ACh
As acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the main cholinesterase (ChE) that performs 80% of hydrolytic activity in the brain, therefore, increasing levels of ACh in the brain, achieved by inhibiting AChE, is considered a good strategy to treat AD
Although there is the evidence that in advanced AD, the ratio of ACh hydrolysis is shifted toward hydrolysis mediated through butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) when substrate inhibition of AChE takes place, which implies that inhibition of BuChE might be a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced AD, the development of AChE inhibitors is still the most successful anti-AD strategy until now
Clinically, the current therapeutic options for AD patients are mainly limited to four AChE inhibitors (Fig.
Regrettably, while these drugs can improve symptoms of cognitive deterioration and memory loss, they cannot fully meet the needs of more patients.
Therefore, there is a pressing clinical need to develop novel and more effective AChE inhibitors with additional functionality for the treatment of AD.
Donepezil, as the world's best-selling anti-AD drug, belongs to the class of benzylpiperidine compounds, and is a selective AChE inhibitor administrated orally
Since donepezil was successfully approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), much of structural modification was carried out based on it.
Researchers have used the benzylpiperidine or indanone moiety as pharmacophores to fuse with other active fragments in the design of multifunctional ligands respectively
In 2010, Alireza Foroumadi's group designed and synthesized a new AChE inhibitor containing N-benzylpyridinium fragments (compound A) for the first time
Subsequently, a large number of N-benzylpyridinium AChE inhibitors were reported
Our group also reported a class of N-benzylpyridinium compounds containing the skeleton of the natural product XJP [(±)
in which the optimal compound B has an AChE inhibitory activity of 0.15 nM and exhibits a good reduction of Aβ and anti-AD effects in the in vivo transgenic Drosophila model
Regrettably, the low permeability of these N-benzylpyridinium compounds to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limited their further development.
On the other hand, replacing the indanone moiety of donepezil with some other heterocycles, such as diarylthiazole, purine, coumarin and ebselen to design donepezil-based multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs), led to another successful modification strategy
Moreover, substituent modification on the benzylpiperidine moiety was another structural optimization method, especially, the incorporation of fluorine atoms.
About 20% of FDA approved drugs contain at least one fluorine atom across many different drug classes
The judicious introduction of fluorine can productively improve physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamics profiles of compounds
A systematic fluorine scan on ligands has become a routine approach in hit-to-lead optimization strategies.
In 2014, Liu's research group introduced a key fluorine atom at the para-position of piperidine in donepezil and obtained an optimal candidate drug DC511020, which is currently in clinical phase II trials (CTR20212054).
The activity of DC511020 was three times more potent than donepezil, meanwhile, it had a larger safety margin to alleviate the undesirable side effects
Alkenyl sulfone, which is similar to chalcone, can activate Nrf2 and induce the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity
It was therefore considered as a promising neuroprotective moiety and has been applied for the design of many new neuroprotective compounds (such as C, D, E, F) for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Fig.
Our aim is involved the fusion of the structure of donepezil with alkenyl sulfone in one molecule, for the first time, to synthesize a series of novel anti-AChE compounds with additional functionalities derived from antioxidant and neuroprotection, for the treatment of AD.

Result and discussion

Design and synthesis
On the basis that the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of alkenyl sulfone are closely related to improve the pathology of AD, in this work we first introduced the alkenyl sulfone moiety, as well as sulfone moiety, into the structure of donepezil to design a class of novel donepezil analogues against AChE, aiming to alleviate the cholinergic deficit effectively for AD patients.
Specifically, an alkenyl sulfone or sulfone group was introduced to replace the carbonyl of donepezil, and additionally, the ring was expanded or opened to explore the possible impact.
In subsequent optimization, the introduction of fluorine atoms is expected to improve the pharmacodynamic activity and physicochemical characteristics of target compounds (Fig.
In our case, retention of the basic skeleton of donepezil was expected to retain a strong AChE inhibitory activity, and the replacement of carbonyl was expected to lead to antioxidant and neuroprotective activities.
In order to initially verify our design strategy, a docking experiment was conducted (Fig.
This structural modification allowed retention of the conformation of the compounds in the binding pocket of AChE that was basically consistent with donepezil, therefore it encouraged us to synthesize the first series of compounds.
Synthesis of compounds 6a-d is depicted in Scheme 1.
Briefly, a sulfonation reaction of 1,2dimethoxybenzene (1a) followed by a reduction reaction to yield compounds 3a, which was reacted with diethyl p-toluenesulfonyloxymethylphosphonate to give phosphate ester intermediate (4a).
Chlorination reaction of compound 4a with NCS led to compound 4b and the resulting intermediate then refluxed in methanol to give compound 4c.
Compounds 4a-c were oxidized with m-CPBA to give sulfones (5a-c), which were reacted with 1-benzylpiperidine-4-carbaldehyde by a Wittig-Hornor reaction to produce the target products 6a-c.
Compound 6d was synthesized by a similar strategy: compound 3a was reacted with ethyl bromoacetate, followed by an oxidative reaction with m-CPBA and a Knoevenagel reaction to produce compounds 6d.
Scheme 1. Synthesis of compounds 6a-d, reagents and conditions: (a) ClSO3H, SOCl2, DCM, 0 °C -rt, 91%;
HCl, Et2O, EA, 85%; (c) diethyl p-toluenesulfonyloxymethylphosphonate, K2CO3, CH3CN, rt, 63%;
AcOH (cat.), toluene, reflux, 35%; (i) NaH, 1-benzylpiperidine-4-carbaldehyde, THF, N2, 0 °C, 44% -87%.
Synthesis of compounds 12a-d is depicted in Scheme 2. Firstly, intermediates 7a-c were hydrolyzed to produce the corresponding acids 8a-c.
Then intermediates 11a-c were synthesized through a Friedel-Crafts acylation, a reduction reaction by Et3Si in TFA, and an oxidation reaction by m-CPBA from compounds 8a-c.
Compounds 11a-c were condensed with 1-benzylpiperidine-4carbaldehyde to give target products 12a-c.
The cis-isomer and trans-isomer (12a(Z) and 12a(E), 1:1) of 12a could be separated by column chromatography.
Finally, compound 12d was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation from compound 12a to explore the activity difference between the alkenyl sulfone and sulfone substituents.
Synthesis of compounds 22a, 23a and 24a-q is depicted in Scheme 3. The key intermediate N-
It was synthesized through a Corey-Chaykovsky reaction, a ringopening reaction and a Swern oxidation reaction from N-Boc-piperidine-4-one (13b).
Intermediate 9a was condensed with compound 16a or 16b to obtain compounds 17a-b, followed by a reduction reaction and an elimination reaction to produce intermediates 19a-b.
Compounds 19a-b were further oxidized to give compounds 20a-b, which were then reduced to produce compounds 21a-b.
Finally, the target compounds 22a, 23a, 24a-q were synthesized through deprotection of the Boc group of intermediates 19a, 20a and 21a-b and a further reaction with diversified benzyl bromides.

Boc

In vitro cholinesterase inhibitory activity and SAR studies
In order to verify the effect of the introduction of the alkenyl sulfone or sulfone group on AChE inhibitory potency, we synthesized the first series of compounds 6a-e, 12a(E), 12a(Z) and 12b-d.
The spectrophotometric method of Ellman was used to evaluate AChE inhibitory potency of all target compounds with donepezil hydrochloride used as a reference compound for comparison
The IC50 values of all the first series of compounds are shown in Table
The results indicated that the groups on the α-position of the sulfone group have a great influence on the activities.
The unsubstituted compound 6a gave a general inhibitory activity against AChE (IC50 = 67.6 nM), however, the introduction of other groups such as chlorine (6b, IC50 = 340 nM), methoxy (6c, IC50 = 8437 nM) and ester (6d, IC50 ＞ 40 μM) was found to be unfavorable for the inhibitory potency.
When the ring A is a five-membered ring (n = 1), the activity improves significantly, meanwhile, trans-isomer (12a(E), IC50 = 4.7 nM) is better than cis-isomer (12a(Z), IC50 = 11.1 nM).
When the double bond is reduced (12d, IC50 = 4.4 nM), the inhibitory potency is equivalent to 12a(E) and donepezil.
When ring A is a six-or seven-membered ring (n = 2 or n = 3), the potency reduces severely (12b and 12c).
Inspired by the potency of compounds 12d and 12a(E), we intended to further introduce substituents on the phenyl ring of benzylpiperidine for structural optimization.
At the same time, taking into account that sulfone derivative 12d could be synthesized more easily through another synthesis route, we decided to further optimize using the structure of compound 12d as a basis.
In the second series of compounds, different substituent groups were introduced to determine whether the AChE inhibitory potency could be improved.
As shown in   Table
The structures and AChE inhibitory activities of the third series of compounds.
a The zymogen of AChE was from the cerebral cortex of mouse.
b IC50: 50% inhibitory concentration (mean ± SEM of three experiments).
The studies so far, therefore, allowed us to obtain complete structure-activity relationships (SAR) for all compounds (Fig.
In summary: 1) the best activity is obtained if ring A is a five-membered ring, specifically, a five-membered ring > straight chain substituents > a six-membered ring > a seven-membered ring.
2) The sulfone group is very important for the inhibitory activity and the activity is almost completely lost when the sulfone group is removed.
3) The introduction of a double bond into ring A greatly reduces the activity and reduction of the double bond outside of ring A has a slight beneficial effect on activity.
4) The most optimal compound 24r is obtained by introducing a fluorine atom at α-position of sulfone group.

Computational docking studies
To further investigate the interaction mode of compound 24r and other representative compounds (12a(E), 12a(Z) and 24b) with recombinant human AChE (PDB code: 4EY7), we performed a series of docking studies.
As shown in Fig.
Specifically, one oxygen atom of the and 12a(Z) (cis-isomer) might be explained by docking studies (Fig.
The binding mode of compound 12a(E) is similar to donepezil, but the sulfone group of 12a(Z) is completely opposite to the carbonyl group of donepezil, generating the loss of two important π-π stacking interactions with
Trp86 and Trp286, resulting in loss of activity.
As for compound 24b (Fig.

In vitro kinetic study of AChE inhibition
To further confirm the mechanism of action of compound 24r, we conducted a kinetic study on this compound.
The linear Lineweaver-Burk plots (1/V vs. 1/S) displayed in Fig.
That means compound 24r is a mixed-type inhibitor against AChE, and it could bind with both catalytic anionic site (CAS)
and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE.
Lineweaver-Burk secondary plots were constructed at obtained slope，using the Lineweaver-Burk secondary plots (Fig.

Compound 24r inhibits AChE enzyme in SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells
Before we started to assess cellular effects of compound 24r in SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells, we firstly determined its cytotoxicity at a range of concentrations 0.01 μM to 100 μM for compound 24r and 0.01 μM to 1000 μM for the positive control donepezil using Cell Titer-Glo assay, and found that the maximum non-cytotoxic concentration for compound 24r or donepezil is 10 μM or 100 μM respectively (data not shown), therefore, testing concentrations below 10 μM for both drugs are used in the following in vitro cell based experiments.
In order to assess the efficacy of novel AChE inhibitor 24r, we determined the AChE inhibitory potency of 24r and donepezil as reference in SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells using the Ellman assay.
As shown in Fig.

Compound 24r reduces tau phosphorylation at S396 but not at S199
After validating the inhibitory activity of the novel compound on AChE enzyme, we investigated whether GA-induced tau hyperphosphorylation could be prevented by AChE inhibition exerted by compound 24r.
Exposure of neuronal cells to 1 mM GA dramatically increased tau phosphorylation levels at S199 (Fig.
Compound 24r and control drug donepezil, did not show a significant reduction of tau phosphorylation at this residue.
To further assess the efficacy of the novel compound in preventing tau abnormal phosphorylation, tau residue S396 was also examined.
In neuronal cells treated with 1 mM GA, we recorded an increased phosphorylation level compared to the untreated group.
In contrast, the abnormal phosphorylation at tau S396 was significantly reduced by the novel compound 24r at a concentration as low as 10 nM, overlapping with the results obtained for the commercially available AChE inhibitor donepezil (Fig.
However, such effect is not dose dependent.
This result is likely caused by the non-specific control of cholinergic signaling over the several kinases and phosphatases involved in tau aberrant phosphorylation.
In particular, a link was shown between AChE inhibition and reduction of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, the major tau kinase
However, this happens in a non-direct manner, since an increased level of neurotransmitter ACh is present following AChE inhibition, by the activation of M1 receptor, which depletion is as well linked to GSK-3 activation
Thus, the effects observed following treatment with AChE inhibitors strictly depend on the subsequent ACh pathway activation as a result of increased availability of the neurotransmitter, which cannot be controlled by the inhibitor itself.

Compound 24r provides neuroprotection by rescuing neuronal morphology and increasing cell viability in 1mM GA exposed SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells
Microtubule architecture plays a fundamental role in cytoskeletal structure in neuronal cells, assuring a correct morphology and axonal transport.
The presence of hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein leads to a jeopardized microtubule architecture, resulting in a disrupted axon morphology, neurodegeneration, and aberrant axonal transport
As shown in Fig.
To assess whether the novel AChE inhibitor is able to prevent the formation of morphological defects in GA treated neuronal cells and further provide neuroprotection, confocal microscopy is used to image neuronal cells treated with either 5 µM or 0.5 µM of the novel therapy in comparison with donepezil.
Treatment with compound 24r resulted in increased axon length and prevented the formation of morphological defects at both concentrations investigated (Fig.
Conversely, donepezil was able to replicate compound 24r results only when administrated at 0.5 µM, while a higher non-cytotoxic concentration of 5 µM showed no preventive effect on neuronal morphology as to a similar extent as untreated (Fig.
The mechanism underlining this phenomenon would require further investigation.
In addition to compromised neuronal morphology, depletion of cholinergic neuronal cells is a well-known characteristic of AD pathogenesis, with the major circuits involved in memory and learning functions represented by this type of neuronal cells.
In order to study whether inhibition of AChE would result in an increased cell viability after 1 mM GA treatment a Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed.
In neuronal cells treated with 1 mM GA, compound 24r treatment significantly prevented the dramatic cell death observed in untreated neuronal cells when administrated at 0.5 µM, and showed a similar amelioration but with statistical insignificance when administrated at 5 µM (Fig.
On the other hand, the control drug donepezil successfully increased cell viability at both concentrations tested (Fig.

Compound 24r reduces amyloid aggregation in presence of AChE enzyme
Tau hyperphosphorylation and deposition of amyloid plaques are considered to be the two major players in AD pathogenesis
Since AChE has a function in promoting β-amyloid peptide aggregation, we investigated whether the novel compound could decrease the aggregation rate by binding to AChE enzyme.
Compound 24r treatment supported the theory that inhibition of AChE enzyme results in a reduction in β-peptide aggregation rate, with all concentrations investigated resulting in a significant drop (Fig.
Similar results were obtained with donepezil, which significantly reduced the amyloid aggregation rate at all concentrations studied.

Compound 24r protects against okadaic acid induced mitochondrial dysfunction
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified in a large proportion of neurodegenerative diseases and it is a key factor in okadaic acid-induced memory impairment and cell death in rodent models used to study AD
Prior studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction and memory impairment can be prevented by donepezil treatment
To investigate whether compound 24r protects against okadaic-acid induced mitochondrial dysfunction we explored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in SH-SY5Y cells using the

Compound 24r protects against okadaic acid induced ROS
With a deepening understanding of cellular mechanisms, oxidative stress is considered as one of the causes of AD
To explore the possibility that compound 24r would protect against okadaic acid-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, we measured intracellular ROS levels These results therefore demonstrate that okadaic acid induces ROS generation, and compound 24r can effectively protect against this effect, preventing the generation of intracellular ROS at 5 μM (P < 0.05, vs. vehicle + okadaic acid), with a similar profile as donepezil.

Cytochrome P450s inhibition assay
Inspired by the excellent in vitro inhibitory potency of compound 24r, we subsequently prepared compound 24r hydrochloride (24r-HCl) to perform subsequent evaluation.
Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) represent a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of drugs.
Drug-drug interactions (DDI) caused by inhibiting CYP450s enzymes may lead to dangerous and serious side effects
We investigated the effect of compound 24r-HCl on a panel of CYP isoforms (CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4-M (midazolam as substrate) and CYP3A4-T (testosterone as substrate)) in human liver microsomes (HLMs).
As shown in a Assays were performed in pooled human liver microsomes.

In vivo blood-brain barrier permeability
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is a basic requirement for successful drug delivery to the central nervous system, especially for anti-AD drugs.
Therefore, we next carried out an in vivo assay with Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice to evaluate the permeability of compound 24r to the BBB.
The results are presented in Table
After intragastric administration (i.g.) at the dosage of 1 mg/kg, compound 24r could be easily detected in both plasma and brain.
Specifically, the concentration of compound 24r in plasma increased slightly from 2.89 to 3.48 ng/mL (from 0.25 h to 1 h) and then gradually decreased from 3.48 to 2.70 ng/mL (from 1 h to 4 h).
In contrast, the concentration of compound 24r in brain increased obviously from 10.58 to 21.95 ng/mL (from 0.25 h to 1 h) and remained unchanged until 4 h.
Meanwhile, the ratio of brain/plasma of compound 24r remained between 4.167 and 8.467 at all timepoints.
Thus, the results of this assay indicated that compound 24r possessed the excellent ability to penetrate the BBB, which might be due to the successful introduction of fluorine atoms.
a Values are expressed as the mean ± SD (n = 3).

In vivo inhibitory activity against AChE
Compound 24r-HCl was performed an evaluation of AChE inhibition in vivo, to assess a dosedependent effect, mice were treated by i.g.
administration with compounds 24r-HCl (0.5, 1, 2, 4 mg/kg) and donepezil (10 mg/kg) as a positive control, then AChE activity in the cortex and hippocampus were tested after 1 h.
The results are shown in Fig.
At a dosage of 1, 2, 4 mg/kg, compound 24r-HCl significantly inhibited the AChE activity in the cortex and hippocampus in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibitory activity at a dosage of 4 mg/kg of compound 24r-HCl was more potent than that of donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
This preliminary result indicated that compound 24r is able to well penetrate the BBB and inhibit AChE in the brain to the similar extent at less than a half dosage (4 mg/kg) than donepezil (10 mg/kg).

In vivo behavioral studies in scopolamine-induced cognition-impaired mice
Inspired by excellent evaluation results of compound 24r above, we performed a step-through passive avoidance test to evaluate the ability of compound 24r to improve memory impairment using scopolamine-induced cognition-impaired ICR mice and donepezil hydrochloride was used as a positive control
A total of 120 female ICR adult mice were randomly divided into six groups, with 20 mice per group: control group, model group (scopolamine), positive control group (5 mg/kg donepezil hydrochloride), low dosage group (0.1 mg/kg 24r-HCl), medium dosage group (0.3 mg/kg 24r-HCl)
and high dosage group (1 mg/kg 24r-HCl).
Three separate trials were performed on all mice after i.g.
administration: a training trial, a learning trial and a memory trial.
The latency time and the number of errors in the learning trial and memory trial of mice were recorded and the results are shown in Fig.
In the learning trial, there was no statistical difference in the latency time between the groups (P = 0.212), but there was a statistical difference in the number of errors; the number of errors in the control group was significantly reduced (P = 0.0038) compared with the model group.
In the memory trial, the latency time of the mice in the control group (195.

Conclusions
In conclusion, for the first time, we successfully introduced alkenyl sulfone and sulfone moieties, a class of fragments with neuroprotective functions, into the structure of parent compound donepezil.
After three series of structural optimization, we identified the most potent compound 24r bearing strong AChE inhibitory potency (IC50 = 2.4 nM) in vitro.
Kinetic and docking studies indicated that compound 24r was a mixed-type inhibitor and bonded with CAS and PAS of AChE simultaneously.
In the follow-up pharmacological evaluations, compound 24r did not only inhibit AChE in SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells, it also reduced GA-induced phosphorylation of the tau protein at its residue S396 but not at S199 residue, indicating that compound 24r may influence the regulation of the tau protein signaling pathway via GSK-3 kinase.
Meanwhile, compound 24r could provide neuroprotection by rescuing neuronal morphology and increasing cell viability in 1mM GA exposed SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cells, while donepezil had no such effect at a high concentration even though cell viability was increased.
Besides, compound 24r could also reduce amyloid aggregation to highlight the possibility of a synergistic treatment effect for AD.
Moreover, compound 24r was found to be more effective than donepezil in two okadaic acid-induced pharmacological models, it is more potent to protect from mitochondrial dysfunction, and provide protection against ROS generation from the neurotoxic effects induced by okadaic acid.
Importantly, the BBB permeability and in vivo AChE inhibitory activity showed that compound 24r could penetrate BBB well and inhibit AChE activity in the brain to the same extent at a dose of 2 times lower than donepezil.
The behavioral studies of compound 24r on scopolamine-induced cognitionimpaired mice strongly suggested that compound 24r could significantly improve the learning and memory impairment of mice at a dose of 50 times lower than donepezil.
In summary, the novel AChE inhibitor 24r exhibits more potent activity of the enzymatic inhibition and a better neuroprotective profile than donepezil, as well as good improvement in learning and memory impairment of mice at a much lower dose than donepezil.
In addition, compound 24r shows the potential to treat AD through additional processes, such as the inhibition of tau phosphorylation and amyloid aggregation, neuroprotection, anti-oxidation and protection from mitochondrial dysfunction.
Thus, compound 24r is a promising lead compound for the further investigation to discovery and development of new anti-AD agents.

The zymogen of AChE was from the cerebral cortex of mouse.
b IC50: 50% inhibitory concentration (mean ± SEM of three experiments).
c The data are the inhibition ratio against AChE at 40 μM.Considering that the sulfone group might lead compounds to be more polar, possibly affect its blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, introduction of fluorine atoms might remedy this potential problem.
Therefore, we introduced fluorine atoms at the para-position of piperidine or the αposition of sulfone group in our compounds.
The results are shown in Table3.
With the introduction of fluorine atoms, compounds still kept potent inhibition.
Almost all compounds, whatever fluorine, chlorine or methyl on the ortho-, meta-, para-position (24g-24m and 24o-24r) on the phenyl ring, showed strong inhibitory potency against AChE except the ortho-trifluoromethyl derivative 24n (IC50 = 3007 nM), which lost the inhibitory activity, possibly due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of trifluoromethyl causing the disappearance of the corresponding π-π stacking interaction.Out of all of the third series of compounds, compound 24r (IC50 = 2.4 nM) with a fluorine atom at the α-position of sulfone group and a fluorine atom at the meta-position of the phenyl ring demonstrated the most potent inhibitory potency against AChE.

sulfone formed a hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) with Phe295 and the neighboring phenyl ring formed an aromatic π-π stacking interaction (4.0 Å) with residue Trp286.
The phenyl ring of the benzylpiperidine moiety bonded with Trp86 of an aromatic π-π stacking interaction (4.3 Å).
The charged nitrogen of the piperidine ring formed two π-cation interactions with Phe338 (6.4 Å) and Trp86 (4.5 Å) respectively.
The docking results therefore indicate a reasonable explanation for high inhibitory activity of compound 24r.

JC-1 aggregates in healthy mitochondria and has a red fluorescence, whereas its monomeric form has a green fluorescence.
Thus, the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio is a measurement of mitochondrial function.As shown in Fig.12A, treatment with okadaic acid enhanced green fluorescence and reduced red fluorescence, causing a reduction in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio compared to the control.
Pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells for 24 hours with compound 24r (5 μM and 0.5 μM) and donepezil (5 μM and 0.5 μM) reduced the effects of okadaic acid on the MMP, indicating a protective effect of these compounds (P < 0.05, vs. vehicle + okadaic acid).
Overall compound 24r has stronger protection than donepezil, both in a dose dependent manner.

Within the cell, DCFH-DA is converted to nonfluorescent 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescin (DCF) which is then oxidized to fluorescent DCF in the presence of ROS.
The green fluorescence intensity as a result of this reaction measures intracellular ROS levels.
Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 0.03 μM okadaic acid increased DCF fluorescence compared to non-treated cells.
Pre-treatment of these cells with donepezil and compound 24r both reduced DCF fluorescence intensity at the concentration of 5 μM, but not 0.5 μM as shown in Fig. 12B.

Meanwhile, the number of errors in the donepezil group(1.95), the low dose group (1.60) and the medium dose group (1.70) were significantly decreased.
