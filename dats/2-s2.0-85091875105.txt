Alzheimer’s Retinopathy: Seeing Disease in the Eyes
The neurosensory retina emerges as a prominent site of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.
As a CNS extension of the brain, the neuro retina is easily accessible for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging.
Studies have shown that along with cognitive decline, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD often suffer from visual impairments, abnormal electroretinogram patterns, and circadian rhythm disturbances that can, at least in part, be attributed to retinal damage.
Over a decade ago, our group identified the main pathological hallmark of AD, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plaques, in the retina of patients including early-stage clinical cases.
Subsequent histological, biochemical and in vivo retinal imaging studies in animal models and in humans corroborated these findings and further revealed other signs of AD neuropathology in the retina.
Among these signs, hyperphosphorylated tau, neuronal degeneration, retinal thinning, vascular abnormalities and gliosis were documented.
Further, linear correlations between the severity of retinal and brain Aβ concentrations and plaque pathology were described.
More recently, extensive retinal pericyte loss along with vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β deficiency were discovered in postmortem retinas of MCI and AD patients.
This progressive loss was closely associated with increased retinal vascular amyloidosis and predicted cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores.
These studies brought excitement to the field of retinal exploration in AD.
Indeed, many questions still remain open, such as queries related to the temporal progression of AD-related pathology in the retina compared to the brain, the relations between retinal and cerebral changes and whether retinal signs can predict cognitive decline.
The extent to which AD affects the retina, including the susceptibility of certain topographical regions and cell types, is currently under intense investigation.
Advances in retinal amyloid imaging, hyperspectral imaging, optical coherence tomography, and OCT-angiography encourage the use of such modalities to achieve more accurate, patient-and user-friendly, noninvasive detection and monitoring of AD.
In this review, we summarize the current status in the field while addressing the many unknowns regarding Alzheimer's retinopathy.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 50 million people worldwide
With no cure and limited options for early unambiguous and noninvasive diagnosis, this devastating and invariably fatal disease remains a major medical, sociological and economical challenge around the globe
Patients with Alzheimer's dementia typically exhibit symptoms of cognitive decline including disorientation, short-term memory loss, confusion, and socio-behavioral impairments.
Beyond psycho-cognitive dysfunctions, these patients often experience visual abnormalities such as diminished color and contrast vision and narrowing of the visual field, as well as disruptions of circadian rhythms manifesting as sleep disturbances
Some of these visual dysfunctions and sleep irregularities have been documented early in the prodromal phase of AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
The neuropathological hallmarks of AD -amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of hyperphosphorylated pTau protein -are well established and characterized in the brains of AD patients
These hallmark pathologies are hypothesized to induce and amplify inflammation and vascular abnormalities, drive synaptic and neuronal loss, and eventually lead to clinical AD-dementia
The preclinical phase of AD-related pathological buildup is an insidious process which can take up to 20 years
Intervention during this preclinical stage, before definitive clinical symptoms appear and when synaptic and neuronal damage is still limited, should hold promise for increased therapeutic efficacy.
Notably, a recent research framework by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) classifies AD as compared with other neurodegenerative diseases based on molecular biomarker detection
The pathobiological phases of AD in living patients, irrespective of cognitive status, are determined on a continuum beginning with Alzheimer's pathologic change and progressing to full AD by molecular biomarkers: Aβ deposition (A), pathologic tau (T), and neurodegeneration [AT(N)].
Accordingly,
Indeed, together with other genetic, longitudinal brain imaging, physiological, and pathological studies, this framework emphasizes that Aβ and tau pathologies are required to define AD.
Moreover, as efforts to develop and evaluate other potential AD biomarkers intensify, including those measuring vascular changes, inflammation and synaptic loss
In addition to the pathology described above, examination of postmortem AD brains demonstrated the existence and propagation of intra-and extracellular, soluble and synaptotoxic forms of Aβ oligomers
Other key features of AD neuropathology include cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
In recent decades, cumulative evidence supporting the neuroprotective effects of certain immune cell types and inflammatory mediators have caused a historic shift in the view of neuroinflammation away from the common, merely detrimental one
In this regard, studies showed that subtypes of bone marrow (BM)-isolated peripheral innate immune cells (e.g., BM-derived CD115 + Ly6C hi CD45 hi monocytes) can be recruited to the diseased brain of AD-model mice.
Interestingly, the recruited cells were shown to directly facilitate Aβ clearance, reduce chronic and detrimental inflammation including scar tissue proteins, and induce synaptogenesis and neurogenesis
These and other promising multi-targeted immunomodulatory strategies of harnessing peripheral immune cells to fight neurodegeneration are currently being developed and tested in various preclinical and clinical trials across the world
Despite these advances, limitations persist due to the lack of readily available in vivo approaches to noninvasively and accurately monitor therapeutic efficacy, motivating scientists to search for new tools that can be widely deployed in the clinical setting.
Indeed, in recent years there has been tremendous progress in the development of AD diagnostic imaging biomarkers, including FDA-approved brain amyloid imaging via positron emission tomography (PET), as well as tau, surrogate markers of inflammation such as TSPO, and synaptic PET imaging
In addition, structural, functional and metabolic brain imaging are instrumental in evaluating neuronal damage in patients
Yet, most of these methods are not suitable for repeated population screening in the preclinical stages.
They are either limited by the use of unsafe ionizing isotopes (radioactivity), high costs, low availability, and/or limited resolution or specificity
As it relates to amyloid PET imaging, available tracers and modalities do not allow for detection of early small or soluble forms of Aβ accumulation
Milestone advances in the development and evaluation of plasma (Aβ 1-42 and neurofilament light concentrations) and CSF biomarkers (Aβ 1-42 , total-tau, p-tau concentrations) have also revolutionized the prospect of early diagnosis for AD
In general, both categories of fluid biomarkers have proven superior to the majority of currently available brain scanning tools with regards to sensitivity, accessibility and cost-effectiveness.
Yet, CSF extraction remains an invasive approach and plasma markers are subject to interference from other bodily organs and peripheral metabolic processes, and therefore may not be able to solely represent the underlying neuropathological events occurring in the brain
These challenges provide great incentive to explore other diagnostic methods for deployment in the general population, perhaps through another CNS tissue -the retina.
Serving as the innermost layer of the eyeball, the main role of the retina in visual perception is the conversion of light signals into decodable neuronal impulses for transmission to the brain.
It consists of the light-sensitive neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
Structurally, the neural retina contains several distinct layers: the innermost inner limiting membrane (ILM), nerve fiber layer (NFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer limiting membrane (OLM), and the outermost photoreceptor layer (PRL) (see left panel in Figure
The five types of neurons for visual perception in the retina are photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells.
The two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, are the primary light-sensing cells.
Rods are responsible for sensing dim light, while cones provide color vision.
Amacrine cells and bipolar cells are the two intermediate neurons that pass visual information to the ganglion cells, which then transmit signals to the brain.
Similar to the brain, the retina also possesses different types of supporting glial cells: Müller cells, astrocytes, and microglia.
Müller cells and astrocytes are the two types of macroglia in the retina and provide support to neurons, while microglial cells act like tissue macrophages.
Blood is supplied to the retina via the central retinal artery, which enters the optic nerve and supports the inner neural retina, and via choroid blood vessels, which nourish the RPE and outer neural retina.
The retina is the only CNS tissue not shielded by bone, allowing for noninvasive imaging and providing a unique perspective into the brain.
A developmental outgrowth of the embryonic diencephalon, the retina fittingly shares many structural and functional features with the brain including a blood barrier and populations of neurons and glial cells, which secrete proteins related to the amyloid cascade (e.g.
BACE1, γ-secretase, ApoE, clusterin)
The retina is physically connected to the brain via axons of the optic nerve (Figure
Further, brain and retinal microvasculatures are morphologically and physiologically similar
Overall, the close relationship between these two CNS tissues and their anatomical sub-structures as well as the feasibility of noninvasive retinal imaging may provide a window into better understanding of processes in the CNS such as healthy aging and neurodegeneration.
Mounting evidence demonstrate AD-related retinal pathology in AD patients and animal models.
Recent studies documented parallels between the brain and retinal pathology found both in AD patients and animal models
While early examinations of postmortem eyes isolated from AD patients revealed loss of optic nerve integrity and RGC degeneration
These findings were also true for MCI and other early-stage AD cases.
Subsequent studies confirmed the original results and further identified pTau, characterized retinal plaque subtypes, as well as demonstrated neuronal degeneration and elevated levels of Aβ alloforms, astrogliosis and microgliosis
In this review, we describe key pathological processes that were found in the AD retina (illustrated in Figure

RETINAL Aβ PATHOLOGY IN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS
One decade ago, and more than a century following the identification of Aβ plaques in the postmortem brain of the first person diagnosed with AD, Auguste Deter, AD-specific pathological hallmarks were shown for the first time in the human retina
In this original study, Aβ plaques were identified in all flatmount retinas isolated from 13 cases with definite and probable AD, as confirmed by both brain pathology and clinical reports (Figures
Retinal Aβ-plaque pathology in these patients was in stark contrast to minimal to no pathology found in the retina of age-and gender-matched cognitively normal individuals (Figures
This and two subsequent studies on human cohorts of over 50 patients and control donor eyes, examining retinal flatmounts and cross-sections with Aβ-specific monoclonal antibodies   (12F4, 11A5-B10, 6E10, 4G8), anti-Aβ dyes (i.e., Curcumin, Thioflavin-S, Congo-Red) and Gallyas silver stain, showed that all neuropathologically confirmed AD patients exhibited Aβ deposits in the retina
Interestingly, through scanning of retinal flatmounts, the team discovered a nonuniform manifestation of Aβ deposits across the human retina.
Plaques were more often detected in peripheral regions, especially in the superior and inferior quadrants
A quantitative histological analysis of whole-mount retinas in a subset of confirmed AD patients compared to age-and sex-matched cognitively normal controls revealed a significant 4.7-fold increase in Aβ 42 -containing retinal plaque burden in patients (Figure
Another group, using a sample of retinas isolated from 10 neuropathologically and clinically confirmed AD and 10 control patients, demonstrated a significant 2.7-fold increase in the number of retinal Aβ 42 plaques that were also found to be larger in volume relative to deposits detected in normal control tissue
Importantly, although retinal Aβ plaques are typically smaller in size compared to brain plaques, their burden in the retina significantly correlated with severity of plaque pathology in the brain (Figures
In particular, retinal amyloid deposits were more strongly correlated with plaque burden in the primary visual cortex and the entorhinal cortex (Figure
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of (12F4 + )Aβ 42 -positive immunoreactivity in retinal tissues from AD patients revealed the ultrastructure of Aβ in plaques, fibrils, protofibrils and annular oligomer-like forms (Figures
Gallyas silver stain further exposed the existence of retinal neuritic-like plaques.
While marked increases in retinal Aβ pathology were noted in AD patients as compared with age-matched cognitively normal individuals, retinal plaques in patients frequently appeared in clusters and preferentially in the mid-and far-peripheral regions
These findings suggest that regional and geometric differences in plaque density should be considered when examining retinal tissue from patients.
Moreover, the use of traditional histological techniques in retinal cross sections of limited regions could account for the few studies unable to consistently detect Aβ in the AD retina
This challenge emphasizes the necessity to standardize approaches for analyzing AD-related pathology across diverse topographical regions of the human retina.
Indeed, following untraditional histological protocols developed by Koronyo and colleagues, three additional independent groups were able to detect Aβ deposits in the retina of confirmed AD patients
Prior examinations of normal aged eyes demonstrated Aβ immunoreactivity in the sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
As it relates to AD, an early biochemical evaluation of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 alloforms in retinal tissues of patients showed their existence in the human AD retina, albeit without comparing to levels in control retinas nor assessing correlation with respective brain levels
Importantly, a recent study corroborated these findings of amyloidogenic Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 alloforms in the retina of AD patients
The study measured Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels in retinal and hippocampal tissues of human cohorts with neurodegenerative diseases and compared between ApoE ε4 carriers and non-carriers
Results from this study showed higher levels of retinal and hippocampal Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 in individuals with ADrelated pathological changes and ApoE ε4 carriers.
Further, levels of both alloforms in the retina correlated with their counterparts in the hippocampus, as well as with NFT and Aβ plaque burden severity
A recent histological study confirmed the presence of retinal plaques in 6 AD patients and 6 healthy controls, including finding similar sized 12F4 + Aβ 42 -containing deposits, and gave additional insight into the spatial distribution and subtypes of Aβ aggregates in the human retina
Aβ-positive immunoreactivity and deposits were found in various cell layers in postmortem retinas of AD patients, particularly the INL; deposits were found within horizontal, amacrine, and Müller cells
Analyses of retinal pathology in AD donors indicated that Aβ deposits were more abundant in the inner retinal layers, concentrating in the NFL and GCL
Aβ 42 was present in both fibrillar and proto-fibrillar forms, confirmed with TEM and Birefringence (apple-green) of Congo redstained retinas under polarized light
More recently, Aβ 40 was quantified and mapped in a larger cohort of postmortem human AD retinas (n = 47), showing significant increases in both retinal vascular and abluminal Aβ 40 in AD patients as compared with matched controls
Retinal Aβ 40 was especially abundant in the inner retinal layers of the central retina.
Increased Aβ 40 in the retina of AD patients as compared with cognitively normal individuals was further validated by biochemical ELISA analysis
Overall, these growing studies confirm the presence of diseaseassociated Aβ species in the human retina and highlight the striking similarities between retinal and cerebral vulnerability to hallmark AD pathologies.

RETINAL TAUOPATHY IN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS
Another key characteristic sign of AD neuropathology that strongly reflects neuronal injury and cognitive decline is abnormal tau, specifically hyperphosphorylated tau and its inclusion in NFTs
The physiological distribution pattern of total non-phosphorylated tau expression in the human retina was first described in 1995
According to this report and subsequent studies, tau is predominantly expressed in the inner retinal layers, most intensely along three distinct bands in the IPL, more diffusely in the OPL and somatodendritically in the INL
Tau is also localized, albeit weakly, in other inner retinal layers such as the GCL and NFL as well as in photoreceptors of the human retina
Initial post-mortem examinations of late-stage AD retinas did not reveal neurofibrillary inclusions, neuritic plaques or amyloid angiopathy, despite histological observations of GCL degeneration, reduced NFL thickness and optic nerve axonal atrophy
While a limited number of studies have been unable to histopathologically detect abnormal tau accumulation in retinas of patients
Results from this study were corroborated thereafter by other groups
Different pTau species, recognized by phosphorylation site-specific antibodies such as AT8 (pSer202, pThr205), AT100 (pThr212 and pSer214), and AT270 (pThr181), were primarily found in the inner retinal layers, particularly the plexiform layers, INL, and GCL of AD patients, thus closely mirroring the physiological expression pattern of normal tau
Interestingly, a recent independent report on a quantitative histomorphometric analysis of post-mortem tissue revealed that these particular retinal layers undergo significant pathological atrophy in AD compared to non-demented control cases
Geometric analysis of postmortem retinal tissue from 6 control cases and 6 AD patients showed more intense AT8-immunoreactivity in superior than in medial retinal regions
Qualitative observations from the same study also showed a positive gradient away from the optic nerve and toward the periphery.
Despite the presence of pTau in all 6 AD retinas, no significant difference was found in retinal pTau area coverage between the two diagnostic groups, likely due to 2 outliers in control cases.
Importantly, a novel and significant association was also found between retinal AT8 burden and cerebral amyloid plaque but not NFT severity
Hyperphosphorylation of tau has been shown to drive the formation of fibrillar tau inclusions and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to disruptions in axonal transport as well as metabolic and oxidative stress, and is closely associated with neuronal death
Although several histological staining approaches have been utilized to confirm the presence of fibrillar inclusions of pTau in human AD retinas, thus far many have been unsuccessful
To date, only one study using Gallyas silver staining detected NFT-like structures in postmortem retinas of definitive AD patients (Figures
As mentioned above, there is an apparent gap in results obtained from different groups, possibly driven by the lack of standardized experimental procedures.
For instance, the same antibodies against pTau reported to produce negative results by one group
Still, by utilizing AT100 antibody, two independent groups detected similar patterns of pTau in postmortem retinas from AD patients (Figure
Future investigations would therefore be necessary to confirm the presence or absence of disease-associated tau conformers in the retinas of AD patients.
Moreover, it is still unclear whether abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau and/or formation of intracellular tangles have similar detrimental consequences in the retinas of patients as those observed in the brain.
Analyses of retinal changes in AD transgenic mice support this putative association and will be discussed in the following sections.
According to data from clinical studies and meta-analyses, levels of total tau and pTau in the CSF remain among the most reliable and sensitive biomarkers for both AD diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression
Several lines of evidence indicate that CSF tau levels are significantly increased in AD patients
Intriguingly, CSF total tau and pTau-181 concentrations were shown to correlate with retinal changes measured by fluorescent lifetime ophthalmoscopy, a technique suggested to detect the metabolic alterations of tissue represented by fluorescence decay of endogenous fluorophores
Nevertheless, the co-localization of pTau
Retinal disorders such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) share a number of common features with AD retinal pathology including progressive deposition of protein aggregates, reactive gliosis and pro-inflammatory responses, metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and retinal atrophy
In 2008, examination of retinal tauopathy in surgically removed tissue from human glaucoma cases revealed intense localization of AT8-positive pTau in horizontal cells residing in the OPL
It is hypothesized that the lateral arrangement of horizontal cell processes may predispose them to retinal stretch injury caused by glaucoma-related elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
Although no association was found between high IOP and dementia
However, increased retinal pTau accumulation and atrophy following injury or due to other neurodegenerative disorders reveal the vulnerability of this neural tissue compartment to structural, functional, and neuropathological abnormalities
Aging remains the principal risk factor in AD and is tightly associated with several visual impairments.
To date, only two studies have investigated the relationship between aging and total tau expression in the human retina.
An early semi-quantitative analysis found no difference between tau immunoreactivity in post-mortem retinas from young and old healthy subjects, although age ranges were not clearly outlined
Another study, examining retinas from enucleated eyes of patients with prior history of ocular disorders, reported a positive correlation between aging and total tau levels in RGCs in a subset of patients, while unable to find evidence of pTau
Such reports further showcase the disparity in these findings and reiterate the need for replication of these studies.
Notably, the effects of aging on the abnormal accumulation of pTau in retinas of healthy individuals and/or patients also remains unexplored.
As it relates to tau imaging in the retina, there are currently no live imaging tools to specifically detect tau aggregates in the human retina.
Preliminary results from a study that utilized spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundus autofluorescein (FAF) to visualize pathological tau aggregates in a cohort of PET-confirmed Alzheimer's patients
Overall, it is apparent that investigations of retinal Aβ pathology and its relationship with cerebral amyloid plaque burden in AD patients are mounting.
However, our understanding of retinal pTau accumulation and associations with brain NFT severity is much more limited.
To date, only a few groups have successfully detected tau hyperphosphorylation in post-mortem human retinas from AD patients, and only one study has shown an association between retinal pTau and cerebral amyloid load in a small number of AD patients.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for systematic and quantitative analyses of retinal pTau in larger cohorts as well as assessment of both the spatiotemporal and pathomechanistic properties of AD-related tau species in the retina and their relationship with brain disease and cognition.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE HALLMARKS IN THE RETINA OF ANIMAL MODELS
In agreement with the above findings in patients, the pathological hallmarks of AD were also described in numerous animal models of AD (see a summary in Table
Both the soluble and insoluble forms of Aβ were found in the retina of sporadic models and transgenic mice harboring familial AD (FAD) mutations
Intriguingly, early manifestations of retinal Aβ plaques have also been detected prior to their occurrence in the brain
Moreover, upon assessment of therapeutic response, researchers found that positive effects of immunotherapy on cerebral Aβplaque reduction were also reflected in the respective retinas in transgenic animal models of AD (ADtg)
These studies illustrate the common retino-cerebral mechanisms of neuroprotection in response to therapy, which encourages the use of retinal imaging to noninvasively assess therapeutic efficacy in real time.
ADtg animals typically express the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP), the source of Aβ protein, in retinal neurons.
Indeed, this protein has been found in the retinas of ADtg drosophila, various ADtg mice (Tg2576, hTgAPP tg/tg , APP SWE /PS1 E9 , and APP SWE /PS1 M146L/L286V ), and the naturally occurring sporadic rodent strain Octodon degus (O.
degus)
Retinal cytoplasmic APP was found to increase in ADtg models
Ning and colleagues found APP immunoreactivity increased with age in cells of the INL and GCL -but not the ONL -as well as the neuropil of the IPL and OPL and the outer segments (OS) and RPE
ADtg rodent models, including Tg2576, APP/PS1, 3xTg, 5xFAD mice, TgF344-AD rat, and O. degus, show cerebral accumulation of soluble and insoluble Aβ with age, corresponding to AD-like progression
Alloforms of Aβ pathognomonic to AD (Aβ 40 and particularly Aβ 42 ) were found to be elevated in the retinas of ADtg rodents
In addition, plaque and insoluble Aβ deposits were identified in retinas of Tg2576, APP SWE /PS1 E9 , APP SWE /PS1 M146L/L286V , 3xTg, and 5xFAD mice, and in O. degus
Tg2576 mouse retinas were cross-sectioned and analyzed for plaque pathology, which was found in approximately 85% of these transgenic mice but was absent in WT controls
Plaques were mostly found in the GCL, INL, and ONL
Yet, one study was unable to detect retinal Aβ pathology in a Tg2576 mouse with cerebral Aβ
5xFAD mice present an aggressive model of amyloidosis, with several familial AD mutations that result in the overexpression of Aβ 42 .
Studies in this model have demonstrated the presence of Aβ 42 in ocular tissues including the retina as well as increases in Aβ 40 in the RPE
In the sporadic O. degus model of AD, Aβ deposition appears to be progressive, accumulating first in the GCL, NFL, INL and photoreceptors
Whole
Importantly,
The identity of Aβ deposits detected in vivo by curcumin was validated by subsequent ex vivo labeling of the respective whole-mount retinas using anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody.
Notably, retinal plaques were observed prior to detection in the corresponding brains
In addition, following intravenous injection of curcumin, flatmount retinas from 2.5-month-old mice were isolated and stained with 4G8 monoclonal antibody, further confirming that the curcumin spots are the same Aβ-specific deposits
A recent study by Sidiqi and colleagues corroborated the previous reports
Crosssectional analysis of adult APP/PS1 ADtg mice retinas revealed Aβ deposits in the innermost layers as well as in the choroid and surrounding scleral tissue; WT controls showed only minimal to no plaque deposition
Studies using the same ADtg model and Tg344F-AD rats (with the same double transgenes) also validated these findings
The initial discovery of tau in the adult mammalian retina dates back to 1988.
In this early study, tau was predominantly found in horizontal cells residing in the OPL of adult rat retinas
On the other hand, diseaseassociated pTau species were detected somatodendritically in RGCs of a commonly studied double transgenic mouse model of AD, known as the APP SWE /PS1 E9 mouse
In line with these observations, intracellular aggregates of pTau have also been detected in retinas of the APP SWE /PS1 M146L/L286V mouse model of AD
Further, recent analyses of young, pre-symptomatic 3xTg mouse retinas showed retinal Aβ plaques and tau tangles in the RGC layer
In the South American rodent O. degus, previously reported to develop several spontaneous AD-like pathologies without genetic manipulation, elevated levels of pTau were primarily detected in the GCL to NFL regions of the retina in both adult and aged animals
In a subsequent study by the same group, early punctate AT8 immunoreactivity in the IPL was reported in young degus, compared with the denser expression in IPL to NFL of juvenile and adult animals
Interestingly, p(tau)-positive aggregates both appeared and propagated to other inner retinal layers earlier than Aβ deposits in these animals
Similarly, retinal accumulation of total tau and epitope-specific hyperphosphorylation were also reported to precede onset of behavioral deficits and brain tauopathy as early as 3 months of age in the 3xTg mouse model of AD
Several live imaging modalities have been developed and optimized for detection of proteinaceous aggregates and metabolic hyperspectral mapping of retinal tissue in rodent models of AD
Using longitudinal scanning laser ophthalmology, Schön et al. visualized and monitored pTau-containing RGCs in the P301S mouse model of tauopathy from 2 to 6.5 months of age and found a steady growth in pTau-positive cell counts
In the rTg(tauP301L)4510 tauopathy mouse model of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), accumulation of both tau and pTau have been observed in RGCs as well as the IPL and INL
These areas are associated with reduced neuronal density and optic nerve degeneration in these mice
In an experimental rat model of optic nerve crush, injury-induced impaired autophagy was followed by an increase in hyperphosphorylated tau (pSer396), which colocalized with apoptotic markers in dying RGCs
Silencing the tau gene exerted neuroprotective effects in this model, indicating that tauopathy following retinal injury similar to that observed in the brain plays an essential role in neuronal atrophy
AD-related tauopathies have also been investigated in a limited number of non-murine animal models of aging or AD.
Selective expression of normal human tau in adult drosophila retina leads to progressive loss of ERG responses without a considerable effect on retinal structure or neuronal density, although TEM analysis later revealed signs of tauinduced retinal synaptotoxicity and abnormal photoreceptor morphology
In the same study, human Aβ expression in a separate group of flies caused an agedependent loss of retinal neurons without altering ERG signals
In the UAS-Gal4 drosophila model of AD, species of pTau, phosphorylated at different epitopes to varying degrees and in a cell type-specific manner, have also been detected in both the retina and brain
In a small number of young and aged primates, total tau expression in the outer retina was observed in the OPL, ONL and inner segment of photoreceptors, whereas AT8-positive pTau was localized predominantly in the OPL and cones
In older primates, pTau staining in retinal cones also appeared stronger compared with younger animals
Altogether, it is apparent that tau expression and pTau accumulation may vary across several species commonly used to model human AD, and future studies should aim to elucidate these differences.
Together with these positive findings, it is important to note that the expression pattern of both APP and tau transgenes in the brain and retina of animal models of AD should not be misinterpreted as a precise reflection of the human disease.
The layer and cellular burden of pathological Aβ and pTau aggregates is most likely governed by the promoter-driven expression of their corresponding transgenes.
For instance, expression of the aggregate-prone mutant tau species in the P301S tauopathy mouse model is driven by the murine Thy1 promoter, which leads to the development of pathology in selected CNS cell types and consequently specific regions
In the retina, Thy1 is uniquely expressed by RGCs
This may underlie the common disparity in findings from stereological studies attempting to characterize regional and cellular susceptibility to AD pathology in CNS tissue from human versus animal models.
Recent developments as well as ongoing efforts to fully characterize complete gene replacement animal models will be invaluable in addressing such limitations in several fields.

RETINAL DEGENERATION IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
In agreement with the observed distribution of retinal Aβ deposits in AD patients, reports have indicated NFL thinning and RGC degeneration in the GCL chiefly within the superior quadrants of the retina
In vivo OCT imaging of these patient retinas revealed degeneration in multiple retinal layers
Reduced macular thickness and volume, measured by OCT, was also found to correlate with cognitive impairment in AD patients
The first study that evaluated melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs), photoreceptors known to drive circadian photoentrainment, in the postmortem retina of AD patients described a significant mRGC degeneration reflected in reduction of both dendritic density and cell number (La
Notably, dendrite loss and cell death were closely linked to Aβ pathology and were colocalized at sites of Aβ deposits (La
These findings were corroborated in another study, which indicated a substantial loss of retinal cells at sites of Aβ deposition (Figures
When compared with age-matched cognitively normal controls, 22-29% retinal neuronal degeneration was detected by Nissl staining (n = 17 subjects) in the GCL, INL, and ONL of AD patients (Figures
More recently, Asanad and colleagues analyzed retinal atrophy morphometrically in the superior quadrants of postmortem retinas from 8 AD and 11 age-matched controls
Measurements were acquired along a distance of 4mm from the optic nerve on the supero-temporal (reaching the macular region) and supero-nasal sides.
Significant retinal thinning was revealed in the NFL (∼40%), GCL (35%), IPL (∼20%), and both nuclear layers (25%) in AD patients.
In the supero-temporal region, NFL thinning was more pronounced closer to the optic nerve, whereas the other retinal layers showed prominent thinning closer to the macula.
However, all analyzed retinal layers showed consistent thinning throughout the superonasal retinal quadrant
Beyond these changes, several studies have demonstrated accumulation of Aβ in the lens of AD patients
These findings are further supported by animal models of AD
In the hTgAPP tg/tg mouse lens, markers of degeneration included nuclear disorganization, organelle loss, cellular swelling, and shape irregularity
In the 5xFAD mouse, Aβ deposits in the retinal pigment epithelium, hypopigmentation, large vacuoles, and Bruch membrane thickening with Drusen-like deposits were observed
Hypertrophy along with choroid changes were also detected in the TgF344-AD rat
Further, in the APP SWE /PS1 E9 mouse, RGC density was lower than in WT controls
A recent finding in 3xTg mice indicated colocalization of both retinal tau tangles and Aβ plaques with neurodegeneration in the GCL
In the same mouse model, tau accumulation was associated with retinal neural dysfunction, as measured by deficits in anterograde axonal transport
Altogether, observations of retinal atrophy in layers recognized as sites of proteinaceous deposition in both AD patients and animal models of the disease illustrate the vulnerability of retinal cell types to pathological processes traditionally associated with the cerebral disease.
In addition, these findings further support the suitability of retinal thinning, in combination with more specific markers, as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for AD.

RETINAL VASCULAR PATHOLOGY IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is defined as a cerebrovascular disease characterized by intense deposition of Aβ in the walls of cerebral arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, among other vascular damage, and is commonly found in the brains of AD patients
Aβ in CAA primarily consists of Aβ 40
In macrovasculature, CAA is composed of Aβ deposition in tunica media and adventitia of leptomeningeal and cerebral parenchymal arteries
The Aβ in CAA will eventually affect all vascular layers and result in degeneration of smooth muscle cells
CAA is prevalent in the elderly who have developed lobar cerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
Although CAA remains a distinct clinical entity from dementia, previous studies have demonstrated that over 85% of AD patients have of CAA of varying severity
The Aβ deposited in the vascular walls triggers several ischemia-induced pathogenic molecular pathways, such as oxidative stress, inflammation and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, leading to further hemorrhagic complications
A study based on parametric analysis of neuropathological data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers' dataset suggested that CAA was facilitating early stage dementia and the transition to moderate dementia
In severe CAA cases, Aβ deposition is usually followed by microaneurysms in cerebral blood vessels
As the retina is a developmental outgrowth of the diencephalon
For instance, the retina has a highly selective blood retinal barrier (BRB), with many similar structural and functional properties as the BBB, which modulates the influx of ions, proteins and water, as well as limits the infiltration of circulating immune cells
The recent identification of an ocular glymphatic drainage system in rodents, clearing fluids and metabolites such as Aβ from the retina and vitreous via an aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-dependent pathway, is a sign of yet another structural and physiological similarity shared by the brain and retina
The same group also demonstrated that this clearance route may be impaired in ocular conditions associated with retinal damage such as glaucoma
Whether similar glymphatic drainage occurs in the human eye and the extent to which disruptions in this process contribute to pathological changes in neurological diseases such as AD remain to be investigated.
Numerous reports have broadly described vascular dysfunctions in the AD retina, including increased tortuosity, narrowed veins, decreased blood flow, microvascular network damage, and compromised branching complexity
Such studies have extensively focused on live imaging of retinal blood flow dynamics of AD patients, yet there is a significant lack of understanding regarding the precise molecular and cellular mediators involved in retinal vascular AD pathology, which could lead to the discovery of potential intervention points of treatments and guide the development of next-generation retinal imaging.
Thus, more in-depth investigations of the pathogenic mechanisms of retinal vasculature in AD development are needed.
To this end, work by Koronyo-Hamaoui and colleagues demonstrated the existence of different alloforms of Aβ deposits in retinal vessels of MCI and AD patients in both perivascular and within vessel walls including within the tunica media and outside the basement membrane
These findings were consistent with what is known regarding cerebral vascular Aβ pathology
TEM analysis confirmed the ultrastructures of retinal Aβ deposits, often in close proximity to or within blood vessels, similar to those found in the brain
Retinal Aβ 42 fibrils near a blood basal membrane were approximately 10-15nm in width with typical anti-parallel β-sheets
In the same human study, the existence of retinal Aβ was verified by Congo red staining under polarized light, by which the investigators revealed positive Aβ fibrils along blood vessels
According to an animal study with APP-overexpressing mice, vascular amyloidosis resulted in increased rigidity of the blood vessels and decreased blood flow in the brain
In addition, a recent clinical study has proposed that cerebral vascular changes may propel other abnormalities in AD pathogenesis
Recent reports suggest that vascular pathology in AD brains occurs very early during disease progression
Yet, it is unclear how early vascular pathology can be detected via retinal imaging and whether it may specifically foretell AD development.
Furthermore, the connections between vascular pathology and Aβ accumulation and clearance in both the brain and retina should be explored in future studies.
To date, several studies imply the potential of utilizing retinal vascular biomarkers for early AD or pre-symptomatic stage screening as well as for predicting cognitive decline
A recent investigation by Shi and colleagues of retinal vasculature in 62 AD and MCI patients and matched human controls revealed early and progressive PDGFRβ deficiency and pericyte loss along with intense retinal vascular Aβ accumulation in AD
Using a modified retinal vascular isolation technique (Figure
The existence of Aβ in pericytes was validated by TEM, which showed intense Aβ 42 deposition in retinal pericytes as well as in microvascular lumen and adjacent to microvasculature (Figure
Further, accumulation of Aβ in arterial tunica media in the retina of several AD patients (Figures
In the same study, histological analysis based on immunofluorescent staining or 3,3 -Diaminobenzidine staining and the use of specific monoclonal antibodies recognizing diverse Aβ epitopes revealed intense deposition of both Aβ 42 and Aβ 40 in AD retinal vasculature (n = 28-36 human samples).
In addition, early loss of pericyte marker PDGFRβ was noted in longitudinal and vertical retinal vessels of MCI and AD patients compared to normal controls (n = 38).
The dramatic loss of vascular PDGFRβ expression significantly correlated with CAA (n = 14) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cognitive scores (n = 10) in a subset of patients, suggesting that retinal pericyte and PDGFRβ loss could predict the cerebral vascular disease and cognitive function.
Further TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 staining demonstrated that apoptosis may be the dominant pathway of retinal pericyte death in MCI and AD retina.
In the brain, the BBB plays an indispensable role in mediating clearance of Aβ through its efflux in the cerebral vascular network
The BBB is established by endothelial cells forming vessel walls, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes in the basement membrane.
In comparison, the BRB is composed of tight junctions of retinal endothelial and epithelial cells together with supporting pericytes.
Despite their organ-specific functions, the BBB and BRB display very similar functions in transport and permeation characteristics
A recent study has established a correlation among BBB, ApoE ε4 and cognitive decline regardless of AD pathology
The recent findings implicated pericytes in AD pathogenesis and future investigations may shed light on the role of the BRB in AD.
Permeability of the BRB may be measured in live laboratory animal models of retinal diseases by the extent of leakage using fluorescent dyes with predefined molecular weight such as fluorescein
In the clinical setting, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) utilizing a fluorescent dye and fundus camera has been an established method for examining retinal vascular circulation and BRB damage
Recently, a newly modified OCT method was developed, the OCT-Leakage.
By using a proprietary algorithm to identify sites of decreased optical reflectivity, the system quantifies and detects the correlation of retinal extracellular space with degrees of retinal edema
A live imaging study in 28 patients has demonstrated agreement between OCT-Leakage and FFA in identifying sites of impaired BRB in diabetes
Given that retinal vascular amyloidosis has been detected in AD
Indeed, a study using OCT angiography in patients revealed increased fovea avascular zone and decreased foveal thickness in eyes of AD patients
Accordingly, recent human studies have demonstrated that retinal vascular abnormalities can predict cognitive decline
Recent progress in retinal amyloid imaging

RETINAL INFLAMMATION IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Chronic, low-grade inflammation is a typical sign of Alzheimer's neuropathology
Neuroinflammation in AD is linked with increased astrocyte and microglia reactivity and neurotoxicity, Aβ and tau seeding and propagation, as well as with microglia-mediated synaptic pruning
As in the brain, some histological studies have implicated inflammation in the retina of AD patients
This is particularly interesting as the eye has historically been considered an immune privileged site
In 1996, Blanks and colleagues discovered increased GFAP expression in retinal astrocytes and Müller cells in the GCL of AD retina, suggesting astrogliosis occurs in the retina of these patients
More recently, detrimental astrocyte and microglial activation was observed along with Aβ plaques, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration in postmortem retinal tissues of 6 AD patients as compared with 6 control subjects
Notably, molecular mediators of innate immunity including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), complement component 3 (C3), osteopontin, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 were found to be upregulated in retinal tissues of AD patients
Although much work in larger retinal samples is needed to investigate the nature and potential mechanisms of retinal inflammation in human AD, various studies in animal models of AD have also provided evidence and insights into retinal inflammation in this disorder.
Ning and colleagues first established the correlation of neurodegeneration and inflammation in the retina of ADtg mice
Other studies have shown increased microgliosis and astrocytosis, infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes, and upregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in multiple layers of the retina and choroid
A recent study in 3xTg AD mice has further described morphological changes in retinal microglia, including increased microglial cell number, soma size, retraction and reorientation of microglial processes, and change in cell locations
In general, retinal inflammation is implicated in multiple traditional retinal vascular and neurodegenerative disorders, including diabetic retinopathy
During the onset of disease pathogenesis, retinal inflammation is usually triggered by an imbalance of pro-versus antiinflammatory molecules.
This can be evoked by a wide spectrum of pathogenic pathways, including overproduction of reactive oxygen species, activation of NF-κB or protein kinase C pathways, inflammasome or microglial activation, advanced glycation end products, or shear pressure and leukocyte invasion due to retinal microvascular damage.
In this context, the recent discovery of early retinal pericyte loss in MCI patients
Future studies should evaluate BRB leakage and the potential relationship with imbalanced retinal inflammatory pathway activation and brain inflammation in AD.
Findings from such studies could lead to the discovery of novel retinal biomarkers to facilitate AD detection and monitoring.

FUNCTIONAL AND VISUAL CHANGES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
As discussed above, the retina undergoes neuropathological changes similar to the brain in AD patients.
This is not surprising given the developmental, physiological, and anatomical similarities between the two tissue types, rendering them vulnerable to AD-related neuronal and functional abnormalities
A host of visual and ocular manifestations were reported in both MCI and AD patients, particularly loss of contrast sensitivity, color discrimination deficits, difficulties with depth and motion perception, circadian rhythm irregularities, and sleep disturbances
Importantly, retinal changes in AD patients such as RGC degeneration, reduced NFL thickness, and decreased blood circulation were linked to specific visual and ocular disturbances
Alzheimer's hallmark pathologies Aβ deposits and tauopathy are found in retinal cell types and topographical regions shown to undergo degeneration and physiological abnormalities in both patients and transgenic animal models
These findings provide a link between AD-related retinal neuropathology and the visual deficits reported in living patients.
For instance, histological examination of retinal tissue shows colocalization of pTau and Aβ pathology in regions associated with RGC loss
Specifically, degeneration of RGCs would undoubtedly compromise their essential role in receiving sensory input from photoreceptors via bipolar cells, and in early stages of visual information processing and conveyance to the brain
In support of this, a recent study utilizing OCT and pattern electroretinography (ERG) in AD patients showed a linear relationship between NFL thickness and the bioelectrical integrity of RGCs and their nerve fibers, which are essential for afferent signal transduction
In addition to the above reported changes, irregularities in efferent ocular pathways in conjunction with retinal abnormalities were also associated with altered pupillary light response (PLR) in patients.
These alterations include increased latency of pupillary constriction to light, decreased constriction amplitude, faster redilation after light offset, decreased maximum constriction velocity and acceleration
Therefore, there is growing interest in exploring various aspects of pupillary responses, using specialized pupillometry tools, in pre-clinical and clinically diagnosed AD patients.
Further to being governed by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, PLR is also regulated by retinal rods, cones, and mRGCs
In line with this, altered PLR in AD patients was associated with retinal mRGC loss (La
Moreover, these intrinsically photosensitive RGCs are also reported to regulate light photoentrainment of circadian rhythms, supported by their tightly regulated communication with photoreceptors and their projections to the central circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
Therefore, retinal mRGC loss is suggested to play a key role in the sleep-wake cycle dysfunctions observed in AD patients
Sleep abnormalities reported in MCI and AD patients include prolonged sleep latency, reduced total sleep duration and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, sleep fragmentation, frequent awakenings and lower melatonin levels at night, and daytime somnolence
Intriguingly, there are reports of sleep disturbances exacerbating or even preceding cognitive impairments
The essential discovery that Aβ accumulates within or in close proximity to mRGCs, which undergo degeneration and dendrite diameter loss, at least in part, can explain impaired sleep patterns and altered pupil dilation in AD patients
These findings also suggest that certain retinal cells are more susceptible to Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and proposes the first retinal damage-based mechanism for functional disturbances commonly seen in AD patients.
The spatial distribution of retinal AD pathology may indicate the specific functional deficit.
Regionally, both Aβ and pTau pathologies appear to preferentially affect the peripheral superior and inferior retinal quadrants in AD patients
This, along with consistent neuronal loss, degeneration of mRGCs and RGCs, and NFL thinning in these particular peripheral regions, could underlie visual abnormalities such as in contrast sensitivity, motion perception and circadian rhythms described in AD
Beyond AD-related manifestations predominantly in the inner layers and peripheral retinal regions, deposits of Aβ were found in close proximity to blood vessels and within vessel walls
Furthermore, vascular amyloidosis positively correlated with the degree of vascular PDGFR-β deficiency as well as Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 alloforms accumulated within degenerating pericytes in MCI and AD retinas
These findings, together with altered retinal neurovascular coupling and structural vascular abnormalities in clinically diagnosed MCI and AD patients
These changes may lead to functional-visual abnormalities.
A study in monkeys has recently provided evidence for the involvement of mRGCs in blue color sensitivity
AD patients are reported to experience altered color vision with a selective and severity-independent deficiency in blue hue discrimination
Interestingly, impaired blue color discrimination also manifests in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders
The second most common cause of irreversible vision loss is glaucoma, a condition characterized by optic neuropathy, apoptotic RGC degeneration and NFL damage, driven by increased IOP and accumulation of proteinaceous deposits of Aβ and pTau
Indeed, a higher occurrence of glaucoma was reported in AD patients compared to controls
Diminished contrast sensitivity, altered motion and depth perception, and oculomotor disturbances in both AD and glaucoma patients are partially attributed to a preferential loss of the functionally relevant magnocellular RGCs (M-cells) and their nerve fibers
Moreover, impaired contrast sensitivity in MCI patients was shown to significantly correlate with the cerebral burden of amyloid and tau pathology
Given the higher concentration of rods in the peripheral retina and their importance in motion and depth perception, low-contrast sensitivity, and peripheral vision, it is not surprising that these visual functions may be adversely influenced by the increased levels of Aβ deposits and pTau in the periphery
Cumulative evidence of vision loss and ocular impairments accompanied by progressive retinal changes in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including glaucoma, multiple sclerosis (MS), PD, and Huntington's disease (HD), robustly support the involvement of specific retinal pathologies in functional and visual manifestations of these conditions
Despite many recent advancements, the field of AD retinopathy is still in its infancy and more studies focusing on mechanistic and causative factors are necessary to determine the connection between specific retinal pathologies, neuronal-type impairments and visual-functional deficits.

RETINAL IMAGING
The mounting case for AD pathology in the retina has motivated investigations to develop various retinal imaging modalities, beginning with blue-light high-resolution photography by Tsai et al., 1991, which indicated a correlation between Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) scores and optic nerve head changes in AD patients
Further studies employed cross-sectional imaging by optical coherence tomography (OCT) or optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)
As mentioned above, the first in vivo imaging of AD hallmark pathology was initially developed and tested in transgenic murine models of AD by Koronyo-Hamaoui and colleagues
The researchers paired curcumin -a natural and safe fluorochrome that labels Aβ fibrils and oligomers with high affinity and specificity -with a modified rodent retinal optical imaging microscope.
Later, this approach was translated to humans and the feasibility to noninvasively detect and quantify individual retinal amyloid plaques was demonstrated in living patients with a modified confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope following oral administration of highly bioavailable Longvida curcumin (Figures
Studies in murine ADtg models demonstrated the feasibility to longitudinally monitor individual Aβ deposits including their appearance and clearance during disease progression and in response to immune-based therapy
Importantly, in the proof-of-principal clinical trial, this noninvasive amyloid imaging technique revealed a significant 2.1-fold greater retinal amyloid burden, termed as retinal amyloid index (RAI), in a group of 10 AD patients as compared to 6 age-matched healthy controls (Figure
Supported by histological findings, retinal Aβ deposits were often found the mid-and far-periphery of the superior and inferior regions, where previously NFL thinning was reported as more pronounced.
Further, amyloid deposits were found above the retinal pigment epithelium in the neurosensory retina, unlike the typical location of drusen
Anecdotal data from 2 AMD patients suggested that retinal curcumin fluorescence signals were diffuse and concentrated at the posterior pole, apparently distinct from findings in the retinas of AD patients
Moreover, results presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on July 15, 2014, from a large cohort of over 150 MCI, AD, and cognitively normal participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study (www.aibl.csiro.au)
found that retinal amyloid fluorescence imaging predicted cerebral amyloid burden and was significantly higher in AD patients
Expanding on this work, Kayabasi and colleagues detected abnormal Aβ deposits in 30 MCI patients using fundus autofluorescence imaging (FAF) and OCT
An additional study utilizing OCT revealed a correlation between retinal inclusion bodies and cortical amyloid burden in pre-clinical patients via florbetapir PET and multiple retinal sd-OCT aggregation markers of possible disease burden
Noninvasive in vivo retinal hyperspectral imaging (rHSI) has also recently been employed in patients and controls.
One study found significant differences in the retinal reflectance spectra of MCI patients with high Aβ burden, confirmed by brain PET imaging, as compared to age-matched controls, validated in an independent cohort with a second hyperspectral camera
Retinal imaging scores correlated with Aβ burden in the brain
Intriguingly, a similar study from More and colleagues, the team that initially developed the rHSI technique in murine models
The same technique was able to distinguish cerebral Aβ+ subjects from Aβ-subjects with 85% accuracy based on retinal vascular measures including vessel tortuosity and diameter
Finally, a recent multimodal approach including visual performance tests, advanced retinal imaging, and full-field electroretinogram (ERG) in 69 cognitively impaired subjects revealed sensitivity of the combined approach to cognitive decline
Although more robust investigations are needed to validate these findings, this study supports the association of retinal geometric vascular and functional parameters with physiological changes in the retina in cognitively impaired individuals
Future tools should assess whether a combination of these multimodal methods with specific retinal amyloid imaging will allow for earlier and/or more accurate assessment of AD.

CONCLUSION
With the number of AD patients estimated to triple by 2050 (Alzheimer's Association, 2019), a reliable, noninvasive and affordable diagnostic technique suitable for widespread clinical use is urgently needed.
In recent years, a radical idea has emerged that AD pathology in the brain can also manifest and perhaps be mirrored in the retina.
Indeed, the identification of hallmark Aβ deposits in the retina of patients and numerous animal models and their correlation with pathology in the brain have fueled this field of neuro-ophthalmology in AD.
Moreover, mounting evidence now supports the existence of diffuse, classical and neuritic-like plaques, pTau aggregates, Aβ 42 fibrils, protofibrils, and oligomer-like structures, pericyte loss, vascular Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 accumulation, inflammation and neurodegeneration in the retina of AD patients
Despite many recent successes, several limitations including the scarcity of retinal tissue from people with neuropathological data and the application of non-conventional histological and biochemical techniques to examine AD effects in various topographical regions, has historically restricted the knowledge in this field.
Future investigations, involving brain biobanks with extended collection of ocular tissues, will allow researchers to determine how early AD pathological processes occur in the retina, their extent, distribution, and relationship to brain pathology.
Histological and biochemical examinations of postmortem retina from AD patients and animal models have proven invaluable in deciphering the pathological burden of disease hallmarks, susceptible retinal layers and cell types, and putative molecular pathways linked to retinal atrophy and functional deficits.
Nevertheless, there is still lack of understanding of the impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on retinal cell types; some effects, including nerve fiber thinning, neuronal loss and vascular changes, may not manifest in early stages of disease and may not be specific to AD.
For instance, reduced NFL, macular, and foveal thickness have also been observed via OCT examinations of Parkinson's disease (PD) patient retinas as compared to normal controls
Notably, according to the 2018 NIA-AA research framework, the presence of Aβ deposits is a requirement for Alzheimer's pathological change diagnosis and should be considered in early screening efforts and recruitment of individuals for clinical trials
The ability to detect and quantify Aβ deposits and related pathologies via noninvasive retinal imaging along with sensitive, routine, minimally invasive plasma AD biomarkers show great promise for diagnostic screening, monitoring of progression, and assessment of therapeutic efficacy
The work described here combined with future advances may lead to clinical translation, discrimination of pathophysiological phenotypes during the AD continuum, and eventually a highly anticipated cure for this destructive disease.
Future investigations should focus on standardization of histological techniques, identification of early AD biomarkers in the retina, their spatiotemporal profiles, and enhancing the sensitivity of retinal imaging modalities for detection of these pathological indicators in this new and expanding field of Alzheimer's retinopathy.
