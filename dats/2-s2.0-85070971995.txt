Inhibiting Acetylcholinesterase to Activate Pleiotropic Prodrugs with Therapeutic Interest in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease which is still poorly understood.
The drugs currently used against AD, mainly acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI), are considered clinically insufficient and are responsible for deleterious side effects.
AChE is, however, currently receiving renewed interest through the discovery of a chaperone role played in the pathogenesis of AD.
But AChE could also serve as an activating protein for pleiotropic prodrugs.
Indeed, inhibiting central AChE with brain-penetrating designed carbamates which are able to covalently bind to the enzyme and to concomitantly liberate active metabolites in the brain could constitute a clinically more efficient approach which, additionally, is less likely to cause peripheral side effects.
We aim in this article to pave the road of this new avenue with an in vitro and in vivo study of pleiotropic prodrugs targeting both the 5-HT 4 receptor and AChE, in order to display a neuroprotective activity associated with a sustained restoration of the cholinergic neurotransmission and without the usual peripheral side effects associated with classic AChEI.
This plural activity could bring to AD patients effective, relatively safe, symptomatic and disease-modifying therapeutic benefits.

Introduction
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the main target of the currently marketed drugs against Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
Inhibiting AChE and the physiological degradation of acetylcholine (ACh), these drugs aim at restoring the cholinergic neurotransmission impaired by the neurodegeneration which induces the cognitive troubles associated with AD.
These medicines are controversial today, mainly due to their loss of efficacy over time.
AChE, however, could benefit from renewed interest as a target for novel anti-AD drugs for two reasons:
The first concerns the discovery of a new chaperone role played by AChE which would be able to interact, thanks to its peripheral anionic site (PAS), with the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and to form neurotoxic aggregates with the latter
Inhibiting this interaction, if possible in a concomitant manner with the catalytic inhibition of AChE, would yield a dual therapeutic benefit against AD.
The second reason is inherent to the explanation which can be given for the loss of efficiency of its inhibitors.
The latter can be imputed to the evolution of the disease and to the consequent neurodegeneration which leads to a decrease in the production of AChE, whose inhibition becomes less
The second reason is inherent to the explanation which can be given for the loss of efficiency of its inhibitors.
The latter can be imputed to the evolution of the disease and to the consequent neurodegeneration which leads to a decrease in the production of AChE, whose inhibition becomes less and less useful over time.
However, preserving the functional status of the cholinergic neurons could make AChE an efficient target in AD treatment once again.
This explains why a lot of clinical trials assessing potential of novel neuroprotective agents are often done in association with donepezil, the most used AChE inhibitors (AChEI), in order to display a synergistic effect
Alternatively, another approach was recently proposed.
It consists of the design of Multi-Target Directed Ligands (MTDL) which are able to both inhibit AChE and to express a neuroprotective effect through an interaction with another target involved in the pathogenesis of AD
Our group recently described, within this framework, the in vitro and in vivo properties of donecopride, the first MTDL able to both inhibit AChE and to activate 5-HT4 receptors (5-HT4R) with potent antiamnesic effects in animal models of AD
These considerations have led to a revival of interest in AChE as an efficient therapeutic target.
Furthermore, this enzyme can be used to reduce the peripheral side effects displayed by novel anti-AD drugs.
Indeed, the latter can be specifically liberated at the central level through hydrolysis by AChE of brain-penetrating prodrugs.
AChE, being inhibited during this hydrolysis, can be considered in this case both as a therapeutic target and as an activating enzyme (Figure
A unique example of such a pleiotropic anti-AD prodrug is currently reported in literature.
Ladostigil
Concerning the present work, we wanted to develop an innovative approach through the design of novel pleiotropic prodrugs which were likely to covalently inhibit AChE and then to liberate active metabolites related to donecopride (2) while keeping its potent 5-HT4R agonist and Dual Binding Site (DBS) AChE inhibitory activities.
These compounds will be designed based on the model of rivastigmine
Rivastigmine is a carbamate compound which covalently binds and temporarily inhibits AChE.
Rivastigmine, which is the only marketed pseudo-irreversible AChEI, consequently restores cholinergic neurotransmission, then alleviating the cognitive symptoms in AD patients.
However, the phenolic derivative, released after the carbamoylation of AChE by rivastigmine, is devoid of any therapeutic activity.
The novel phenolic derivatives
They were carbamoylated into carbamates
The capacity of the latter to inhibit AChE in a covalent manner was investigated.
In order to avoid possible peripheral side effects, their lack of other activities was verified.
The ability of a selected carbamate to liberate the corresponding phenolic derivative upon AChE-dependent hydrolysis has been studied, as well as its capacity to easily cross the blood brain barrier (BBB).

Therefore, during the docking study of compound 7 into the (h)AChE active site (PDB code: 4EY7
In parallel, the Ser203 side chain was kept flexible during the docking.
The generated poses of compound 7 with scores between 85.44 and 100.64 could be divided in two major clusters which differ principally in the position of the methoxy phenyl moiety and phenyl one.
In cluster 1 (see Figure
Compound 7 docks in the AChE active site with the carbamate group in proximity of Ser203, as imposed by the constraint, but it is positioned much higher in the AChE binding site in two clusters compared to the donepezil and/or the donecopride (Figure
Consequently, according to our molecular modeling results, compound 7 loses the characteristic interactions of the donecopride ligands family, i.e.,: i) interaction between NH + of piperidine ring through the water molecule lying between the hydroxy groups of two tyrosines (Tyr341 and Tyr337); ii) interaction via C=O group with the backbone NH of Phe295; and iii) the methoxyphenyl moiety is placed a little high but stacking with Trp286 remains possible.
On the other hand, the C=O group of compound 7 establishes a new interaction through a hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of Ser293 in cluster 1.
So, the 'donecopride' part attached to carbamate of compound 7 brings few interactions in addition to carbamate group ones, and the interaction with the AChE binding site is realized mainly thanks to the carbamate group.

Spontaneous Alternation Deficit
We then decided to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of compound 20 in cognition models.
Whatever the pharmacological agent used to induce a cognitive deficit (scopolamine -SCOP or dizocilpine, MK801), ANOVA of percentage of spontaneous alternation revealed a group effect (respectively, F(2,23) = 7.281; p = 0.0036 and F(2,25) = 4.778; p = 0.0175) (Figures
In both cases, the control group displayed an alternation percentage significantly higher than animals receiving either SCOP or MK801 plus NaCl, demonstrating a pharmacologically-induced cognitive deficit (SNK, p < 0.001).
Further, while the control group showed higher spontaneous alternation than animals receiving SCOP + compound 20 (SNK, p < 0.05), no statistical difference was observed compared to animals receiving MK801 + compound 20 (SNK, p = 0.0621).
Additionally, a univariate t-test revealed that in the two conditions (SCOP and MK801), only the control group and animals having received compound 20 displayed an alternation percentage which was significantly different from the value of the chance level (i.e.
50%).
Hence, those results point to the ability of compound 20 to offset-at least partially-working memory deficits, whether they result from cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission alteration.
Interestingly, these anti-amnestic effects are effective at a relatively low dose with respect to the estimated LD50.

Discussion
An in vitro evaluation of the three phenolic derivatives of donecopride 4-6 led us to select 4 in the keto series on the basis of its AChE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 149 nM); such activity appeared to be absent in 5 and 6.
The 5-HT4R affinity of 4 (Ki = 5.1 nM) appeared to be slightly less potent than its ester analogue (Ki = 0.6 nM), but was preferred due to its dual activity.
The fumaric acid salt of 4, 19, which maintains the dual activity, further expresses a partial 5-HT4R agonist pharmacological profile and a non-competitive-type AChE inhibitory profile.
Consequently, it would act as a DBS AChEI.
The carbamate 7, as well as its fumaric acid salt 20, derived from 4, are devoid of any activity towards 5-HT4R in a similar manner as 8 and 9.
This lack of activity was sought in order to reduce the occurrence of possible peripheral side effects.

This lack of activity was sought in order to reduce the occurrence of possible peripheral side effects.
Compounds 7 and 20 further inhibited AChE with a similar intensity as rivastigmine (IC 50 = 4.1 µM).
The kinetic study of 20, furthermore, established its covalent binding to the enzyme, and an analytic study demonstrated its concomitant AChE-dependent hydrolysis and the release of the corresponding phenolic derivative 4. Finally, the capacity of 19 to easily cross the BBB was attested using the PAMPA model.
On the basis of these predictive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, 20 was selected for two in vivo studies aiming at demonstrating its potential antiamnesic effect in two different models of spontaneous alternation deficit in mice using either scopolamine or MK801 to induce cognitive impairments.
These results support our expected mechanism of action and afford preliminary proof of concept of an in vivo release of a phenolic derivative (from carbamate precursor).
Hence, having irreversibly blocked acetylcholinesterase during its release from carbamate, the phenolic derivative would then be capable of modulating our serotoninergic receptors of interest (5-HT 4 receptors).
Further studies will be needed to validate this, but some data from the literature reinforce this hypothesis.
In particular, some studies in rodents have shown the ability of rivastigmine (which has a pharmacodynamic profile close to that of our compound 20) to counterbalance scopolamine-induced memory performance deficit in various tests
Interestingly, this same rivastigmine, used under similar conditions, proved to be ineffective in improving memory deficits induced by MK 801
Thus, the superiority in the MK801 model of our compound relative to rivastigmine may be related to the release of the phenolic derivative having affinity and significant activity towards 5-HT 4 receptors.

Structures of human acetylcholinesterase in complex with pharmacologically important ligands
The AChE amino acid protonation state was checked before the docking study using the ProPKA software and the proposed protonation for Glu202 was applied.
The docking of the compound into the AChE was carried out with the GOLD program (v5.7.2, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, CCDC) using the default parameters
This program applies a genetic algorithm to explore conformational spaces and ligand binding modes.
To evaluate the proposed ligand positions, the ChemPLP fitness function was used.
The binding site in the AChE model was defined as a 7 Å sphere from the co-crystallized donepezil ligand, and a water molecule interacting with a protonated piperidine ring of donepezil was conserved during the docking (residue number 931).
The Ser203 side chain was kept flexible and a hydrogen bond constraint between Ser203 side chain and carbonyl oxygen was applied during the docking.

Biological Evaluation

In Vitro Tests of AChE Inhibitory Activity
The inhibitory capacity of compounds on AChE biological activity was evaluated through the use of the spectrometric method of Ellman
Acetylthiocholine iodide and 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
AChE from human erythrocytes (buffered aqueous solution, ≥500 units/mg protein (BCA), Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was diluted in 20 mM HEPES buffer pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100 such as to have enzyme solution with 0.25 unit/mL enzyme activity.
In the procedure, 100 µL of 0.3 mM DTNB dissolved in a phosphate buffer with pH 7.4 were added into the 96-well plates followed by 50 µL of the test compound solution and 50 µL of enzyme (0.05 U final).
After 5 min of preincubation at 25 • C, the reaction was then initiated by the injection of 50 µL of 10 mM acetylthiocholine iodide solution.
The hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine was monitored by the formation of yellow 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion as the result of the reaction of DTNB with thiocholine, released by the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine, at a wavelength of 412 nm using a 96-well microplate plate reader (BioTek, Synergy 2, Winooski, VT, USA).
Test compounds were dissolved in analytical grade DMSO.
Donepezil (DPZ) and Rivastigmine were used as a reference standard.
The rate of absorbance increase at 412 nm was followed every minute for 10 min.
Assays were performed with a blank containing all components except acetylthiocholine, in order to account for non-enzymatic reactions.
The reaction slopes were compared and the percent inhibition due to the presence of test compounds was calculated by the following expression: 100 -(v i /v 0 × 100), where v i is the rate calculated in the presence of inhibitor and v 0 is the enzyme activity.
The first screening of AChE activity was carried out at a 10 -6 concentration of compounds under study.
For the compounds with significant inhibition (≥50%), IC 50 values were determined graphically by plotting the % inhibition versus the logarithm of six inhibitor concentrations in the assay solution using the GraphPad Prism 6 software.

Kinetic Study for AChE Inhibition
To try to clarify the mechanism of action of 19 and 20, reciprocal plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/[substrate] were constructed at different concentrations of the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide (0.01-1 mM) by using the spectrometric method by Ellman et al.
Four concentrations of 19 were selected for the studies: 10 -6 , 10 -7 , 10 -8 and 10 -9 M for the kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition.
Four concentrations of 20 were selected for the studies: 10 -5 , 10 -6 , 10 -7 and 10 -8 M for the kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition.
The plots were assessed by a weighted least squares analysis that assumed the variance of velocity (ν) to be a constant percentage of ν for the entire dataset.
Slopes of these reciprocal plots were then plotted against the concentration of 19 and 20 in a weighted analysis.

Pharmacological Characterization of Drugs on Human 5-HT 4 R
For competition studies, 2.5 µg of proteins  membrane preparations, HTS110M, Eurofins.
Eurofins  membrane preparations are crude membrane preparations made from their proprietary stable recombinant cell lines to ensure high-level of GPCR surface expression.)
were incubated in duplicate at 25 • C for 60 min in the absence or the presence of 10 -6 or 10 -8 M of each drug (9 was used as a reference standard) and 0.2 nM [ 3 H]-GR113808 (NET 1152, Perkin Elmer) in 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4, 25 • C).
At the end of the incubation, homogenates were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters (Alpha Biotech) pre-soaked with 0.5% polyethylenimine using a Brandel cell harvester.
Filters were subsequently washed three times with 1 mL of ice-cold 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4, 4 • C).
Non-specific binding was evaluated in parallel in the presence of 30 µM serotonin.
For some of these compounds, affinity constants were calculated from five-point inhibition curves using the GraphPad Prism 6 software and expressed as Ki ± SD.
Determination of cAMP Production COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (dFCS) and antibiotics.
Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with plasmids encoding HA-tagged 5-HT 4 R (100 ng/10 6 cells), then seeded in 96-well plates (16,000 cells/well).
Twenty-four hr after transfection, cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of 5-HT 4 R ligands in the presence of 0.1 mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO-20-1724, at 37 • C in 100 µL of HBS (20 mM HEPES; 150 mM NaCl; 4.2 mM KCl; 0.9 mM CaCl 2 ; 0.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.1% glucose; 0.1% BSA).
After 10 min, cells were then lysed by the addition of the same volume of Triton-X100 (0.1%).
Quantification of cAMP production was performed by HTRF ® using the cAMP Dynamic kit (Cisbio Bioassays, Codolet, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay
The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) blood-brain barrier (BBB) experiments were conducted using the Pampa Explorer Kit (Pion Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.
Briefly, the donecopride fumarate solution (20 mM in DMSO) was diluted in Prisma HT buffer (pH 7.4; pION) to 100 µM; 200 µL this solution (n = 6) was added to the donor plate (P/N 110,243).
Five microliters BBB-1 Lipid (P/N 110,672) was used to coat the membrane filter of the acceptor plate (P/N 110,243).
Two hundred microliters Brain Sink Buffer (P/N 110,674) was added to each well of the acceptor plate.
The PAMPA sandwich was assembled and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 4 h without stirring.
The sandwich was then separated, and the UV-visible spectra were measured for both the donor and receiver wells with the microplate reader (Tecan Infinit M200).
The -logPe and Pe (PAMPA effective permeability coefficient) were calculated by the PAMPA Explorer software version 3.7 (pION) for studied compounds.
Corticosterone (-logPe = 4.76, Pe = 17.2 × 10 -6 cm/s) and theophylline (-log Pe = 6.44,
Pe = 0.40 × 10 -6 cm/s) were used as positive and negative references, respectively.

AChE-Dependent Decarbamoylation
The HPLC analyses were performed using an Agilent pump 1290, an autosampler 1290 and a diode array UV detector 1260 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
A reversed phase column C18 (Zorbax1 Eclipse Plus RRHD, 1.8 µm, 2.1 × 50 mm, Agilent) has been used for all components.
A binary pump was used and the mobile phase was always composed of a mixture of (A) water (0.1% formic acid) and (B) acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid).
Solutions of compound 19 and 20 were prepared in a PBS buffer (pH 7.4).
AChE from Electrophorus electricus (buffered aqueous solution, ≥ 500units/mg protein (BCA), Sigma Aldrich) was diluted in PBS buffer pH 7.4, such as to have enzyme solution with 250 unit/mL enzyme activity.
Solution was prepared by addition of 250 µL of the abovementioned enzyme stock solution to 5 µL of solution of compounds 19 or 20 at 255 µM.
The mixture was stirred during 24 h at rt.
The mixture was extracted by 300 µL of EtOAc, and 250 µL of the organic layer was reduced by nitrogen flow.
The crude product was submerged in 50 µL of ACN, then analyzed by UPLC and LC-MS.

In Vivo Biological Studies
Animals. Adult male NMRI mice (3 months old, weighing 35-40 g) from Janvier labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were used to perform experiments.
Mice were housed by ten in standard polycarbonate cages in standard controlled conditions (22 ± 2 • C, 55 ± 10% humidity) with a reversed 12 h light/dark cycle (light on at 7 pm).
Food and water were available ad libitum in the home cage.
All experiments were conducted (between 9 am and 3 pm) during the active-dark phase of the cycle and were in agreement with the European Directives and French law on animal experimentation (personal authorization n • 14-17 for MB and 14-60 for TF).
CNS-activity and acute toxicity test.
Behavioral and neurological changes induced by graded doses (1, 10, 100 mg/kg) of the tested derivatives were evaluated in mice, in groups of four, by a standardized observation technique at different times (30 min, 3 and 24 h) after intraperitoneal administration
Major changes of behavioral data (for example, hypo-or hyperactivity, ataxia, tremors, convulsion, etc.) were noted in comparison to the control group.
The approximate DL 50 of the compounds were also calculated through the quantification of mortality after 24 h.
Amphetamine (2 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg) were used as the stimulant and depressive references, respectively.
Locomotor activity.
The locomotion of mice was measured using an actimeter (Imetronic ® , Pessac, France) through infrared detection.
Eight individual removable polycarbonate cages (21 cm length, 7 cm wide and 12 cm high), in which each mouse was placed, were used in the actimeter.
Locomotor activity was measured by recording the number of interruptions of beams of the red light over a period of 30 min through a recording system attached to the actimeter.
Compound 20 was tested at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg.
Chlorpromazine (3 mg/kg) were used as depressive reference
Spatial working memory.
The antiamnesic activity of the tested compounds was evaluated by a reversal of deficit on spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y maze test
Deficits were pharmacologically induced either by scopolamine (SCOP, 0.5 mg/kg) or dizocilpine (MK801, 0.1 mg/kg).
The Y maze made of grey plastic consisted of three equally-spaced arms (21-cm long, 7-cm wide with walls 15-cm high).
The mouse was placed at the end of one of the arms and allowed to move freely through the maze during a 5 min session, while the sequence of arm entries was recorded by an observer.
An arm entry was scored when all four feet crossed into the arm.
An alternation was defined as entries into all three arms on a consecutive occasion.
The number of possible alternations is thus the total number of arm entries minus two; the percentage of alternation was calculated as (actual alternation/possible alternation) 100.
Compound 20 was tested at 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg.
Pharmacological treatments.
Amphetamine (+)-α-Methylphenethylamine hemisulfate, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, MK801 hydrogen maleate and scopolamine hydrobromide were purchased from Sigma (France).
All pharmacological compounds were dissolved in NaCl 0.9%, used as vehicle.
Besides, all were administered IP 30 min before tests, except for scopolamine and MK801, which were subcutaneously administered 20 min before spontaneous alternation test.
Statistical analysis.
Results were expressed as mean ± SD and were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Statview ® software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA, USA).
In case of significance, a SNK (Student-Newman-Keuls) post hoc test was realized.
Additionally, for the spontaneous alternation test, the percentage of alternation was compared to a theoretical 50% value (random alternation) by a univariate t-test.
Differences were considered as statistically significant if the p value was strictly under 0.05.

Conclusions
We succeeded in designing and synthesizing a pleiotropic prodrug which benefits from a carbamate structure 20 to easily cross the BBB and covalently bind to central AChE.
Upon hydrolysis by the enzyme, 20 releases a phenol compound 4 which, contrarily to 20, acts both as a DBS AChEI and as a 5-HT 4 R partial agonist.
With this unique in vitro profile, 20 displayed, in vivo at a low dose of 1 mg/kg, antiamnesic effects towards cognitive deficits, resulting from either cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmission impairments in mice.
These results seem to support conjecture that this pleiotropic prodrug is both peripherally safe and shows great efficiency in AD pathogenesis and symptoms.
