In vivo localization of human acetylcholinesterase-derived species in a β-sheet conformation at the core of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease
In vivo localization of human acetylcholinesterase-derived species in a ␤-sheet conformation at the core of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease
A rising number of pathologies of great public health concern (e.g.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) 3 and type II diabetes) result from polypeptide misfolding, ordered aggregation, and aggregate deposition, known as amyloids
Although amyloids originate from distinct polypeptides and share no sequence homology, they have similar properties (e.g.
cross-␤-sheet structure)
Amyloidogenesis is driven by properties of the sequence backbone and specific side-chain interactions (4 -7).
AD hallmarks are extracellular deposits of ␤-amyloid peptides (A␤) in senile plaques and intracellular deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT)
A␤ originates from sequential proteolysis of human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP).
Various mutations in hAPP lead to hereditary AD forms (e.g.
Swedish mutation (hAPPswe)).
The amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD proposes that A␤ is ultimately responsible for pathology during which increased A␤ production or reduced clearance leads to toxicity
Although elevated plaque burden is the histological criterion for AD diagnosis, only the level of soluble A␤ found in cerebrospinal fluid correlates with disease severity.
Senile plaques in AD brain also contain "secondary" molecules, among which is the synaptic form of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE-S).
The cholinergic hypothesis sees AD as a specific pathology of brain cholinergic pathways: acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission is selectively and severely impaired or lost, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are the most affected, normal hAChE-S hippocampal and cortical fiber networks are severely reduced, and hAChE-S inhibition for 1 year with donepezil in suspected prodromal AD patients decreases the rate of hippocampal atrophy by 45%
Unfortunately, neither the amyloid cascade nor the cholinergic hypothesis alone explains the full extent of AD pathogenesis.
Evidence of a connection includes the following: altered hAChE-S (catalytically, oligomerization and glycosylation) is associated with AD plaques and tangles; hAChE-S enhances A␤ fibrillization in vitro (leading to stable complexes that alter its catalytic activity) and A␤ toxicity ex vivo and in vivo, and mice expressing both hAPPswe and hAChE-S show earlier disease onset than single transgenic mice
The spread of senile plaque-containing hAChE-S beyond brain areas rich in cholin-ergic innervation also suggests that hAChE-S role in plaque formation goes beyond cholinergic activity.
Several hAChE variants result from alternative splicing (hAChE-S and hAChE-R, for readthrough) or alternative promoter usage (N-AChE-S and N-AChE-R, with an extended N terminus)
In contrast to the synaptic variants, the readthrough variants delay A␤ fibrillization and tau hyperphosphorylation, and inversely affect plaque burden in transgenic mice (hAPPswe-hAChE-R versus hAPPswe-hAChE-S)
The two variants only differ in their C-terminal domains, with only hAChE-S containing the amphiphilic 40-residue C-terminal domain (T40, AChE 575-614 ), implicating T40 in AD pathology
T40's classic role is to mediate oligomerization to form a variety of hAChE-S isoforms (e.g.
soluble and amphiphilic, membrane-bound or anchored to the extracellular matrix).
Intact, T40 is nonamyloidogenic, ␣-helical, and does not promote A␤ assembly
T40 has a region, AChE 586 -599 , with shared homology to A␤, which as a peptide under physiological conditions adopts ␤-sheet conformation, is amyloidogenic, and promotes A␤ nucleation
In vitro, T40-derived amyloid species are generated by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a protease implicated in A␤ processing and genetically linked to AD. IDE-T40 peptides adopt ␤-structures, are amyloidogenic, and promote A␤ assembly
C-terminal T40 proteolysis of hydrophilic monomers and tetramers of bovine AChE-S occurs in vivo
Also, naturally occurring soluble monomeric G1 AChE from fetal bovine serum, but not the tetrameric G4 form, lacks the T40 domain
These studies suggest that in vivo T40 is vulnerable to proteolysis even in tetramers, and cleaved T40 from G1 AChE can be further digested to generate amyloidogenic species.
Amyloidogenesis is a nucleation-dependent polymerization with an energetically unfavorable lag phase, an elongation phase (nuclei extension by monomer addition), and a plateau phase when fibril extension ends (3).
To promote nucleation, initial triggers may be required.
For example, during seeding, homologous or heterologous amyloidogenic species provide a conformationally competent template to accelerate initial misfolding and formation of early assembly intermediates, including toxic oligomers
In vitro and in vivo seeding occurs in various amyloid systems, including A␤
Plaque-associated hAChE-S may promote heterologous seeding of A␤, which would accelerate toxic oligomer formation and might result in stable A␤-hAChE-S heterocomplexes
This seeding hypothesis may represent a previously undescribed pathological trigger for more severe A␤ pathology during AD, in which A␤ abundance is not the only driving factor.
Thus, detailed dissections of the protagonists involved, including their recruitment, formation, and participation in amyloidogenesis, should provide invaluable insights for targeting and controlling diseases involving toxic protein aggregation and deposition.
Here, we investigated the in vivo implication of hAChE-S in AD pathology, using a double transgenic mouse model for hAChE-S/hAPPswe (Tg2576 background, APP 695 isoform)
In contrast to hAPPswe single transgenic mice, these mice develop more numerous, frequent, and early amyloid plaques (6 months), which contain A␤ 1-40 , A␤ 1-42 , markers of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, and hAChE-S, as do natural AD amyloid deposits
The extent of amyloid burden was also tightly correlated with memory impairment, more so than in the hAPPswe single transgenic mice
In contrast to transgenic mice with various forms of hAPP, which only address A␤-related pathology, the presence of the hAChE-S transgene also confirms changes resulting in an imbalance of cholinergic function and neurotransmission.
Indeed, overexpression of hAChE-S in transgenic mice triggers a progressive decline in spatial learning and memory, cessation of dendritic branching, reduced number of spines in cortical neurons, and enhanced high-affinity choline uptake, all of these being hallmarks of cholinergic malfunction and characteristics reported in senile dementia
Opposite effects were observed in mice transgenic for hAChE-R
This study used synthetic peptides corresponding to products of IDE proteolysis on hAChE-S T40 to fully characterize their potential in terms of ␤-sheet propensity and conformation, surfactant activity, fibrillization, co-fibrillization, and seeding of A␤.
We established the importance of sequences or residues underlying plaque assembly, and we selected the most amyloidogenic peptide for raising specific antibodies.
The new antisera were characterized for specificity and used with other specific antibodies to immunolabel coronal brain sections from 12-month-old WT, hAChE-S single transgenic, hAPPswe single transgenic (Tg2576, APP 695 isoform), and hAChE-S/ hAPPswe double transgenic mice.
Mature plaques in cerebral cortex contained hAChE-S and A␤, as in AD.
Importantly, hAChE-S ␤-sheet species were detected in plaque cores, surrounded by ␣-helical forms.
Plaque hAChE-S ␤-sheet species co-localized with fibrillar amyloid material and A␤.
These findings provide the first in vivo evidence of hAChE-S conformation in senile plaques.

Results
We previously established that IDE proteolysis of T40 generates amyloid species seeding A␤ fibrillization
Now we have characterized a set of individual synthetic peptides identified from a T40 -IDE digest, rather than as a peptide mixture.
Two new antisera were generated by immunization with the 'best' amyloidogenic T40 -IDE peptide, to use along with other specific antibodies to label brain sections of control mice, hAChE-S, hAPPswe, and hAChE-S/ hAPPswe transgenic mice.
identified two regions, WKAEFHR and SYMVHWK (Fig.
Trp 591 and Ser 592 were predicted as random coils, unlike their configuration in the AChE 586 -599 context.
It was also evident that T40 N terminus (DTLDEAERQ) and C terminus (NQFD) have propensities for both random coil and ␣-helix, and that His 589 has a negative effect on the following RWSS.
The two peptides with the strongest predicted propensity for ␤-strand conversion are AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW) and AChE 594 -598 (YMVHW).
We further analyzed the T40 -IDE peptides using three other algorithms, which confirmed the findings from the Yoon and Welsh algorithm (Fig.
CamSol, which predicts protein solubility and generic aggregation propensity, identified SYMVHWK as being poorly soluble, followed by KAEFHR, the T40 N and C termini being highly soluble, and His 589 -Arg 590 to have negative effects on the following WSS (Fig.
TANGO predicts ␤-sheet aggregation, percentage occupancy of ␤-sheet aggregation, ␤-sheet, and ␣-helical conformations
TANGO identified AEFHR and YMVHW as having ␤-sheet aggregation propensity; AChE 585-597 and AChE 590 -598 (the immunization peptide used later in the study) as having the two highest aggregation propensities, and His 589 along with T40 N terminus as having a negative impact (Fig.
WALTZ, which identifies protein motifs that nucleate amyloid fiber formation, recognized RWSSYMV as having amyloid propensity (Fig.
Next, we used far-UV CD to follow conformational changes of T40 -IDE peptides before (acidic pH) or during aggregation (neutral pH).
In previous studies, AChE 586 -599 was random coil when nonaggregated but ␤-sheet on neutralization.
Phe 588 , Trp 591 , Ser 592 , Ser 593 , Tyr 594 , Met 595 , Val 596 , and Trp 598 were all important in the conformational transition
Fig.
At acidic pH, all peptides but AChE 582-594 had some random coil conformation (negative ellipticity ϳ200 nm or less).
All peptides but AChE 575-593 (␣-helical, double-negative ellipticity minima ϳ208 and 220 nm) had partial ␤-structures, with the majority having a dominant ␤-sheet conformation (double-negative ellipticity minima at 200 and 215 nm).
After 24 h of neutralization, three peptides still showed dominant random coil conformations: AChE 584 -603 , AChE 589 -599 , and AChE 594 -598 .
Another AChE 575-593 remained dominantly ␣-helical, and AChE 589 -598 underwent a conformational change from a dominant random coil to dominantly ␣-helical.
In contrast, AChE 590 -598 only adopted ␤-sheet conformation, rather than a mixed ␤-sheet/random coil.
In term of adoption and/or conformational change to ␤-sheet conformation, these results indicate negative effects of the T40 N and C termini (DTLDEAERQ in AChE 575-593 , and NQFD in AChE 584 -603 ) and the detrimental effect of His 589 (AChE 589 -598 /AChE 589 -599 versus AChE 590 -598 ).
We also found that 582 RQ 583 are important for adoption of a partial ␤-turn rather than a partial random coil conformation (AChE 582-594 versus AChE 584 -594 ).
A further question was whether the nondominant ␤-sheet T40 -IDE peptides would adopt a dominant ␤-sheet conformation at high concentrations or whether membrane-mimicking SDS was present (Fig.
For AChE 584 -594 (WKAEFHRWSSY), the double concentration caused a transition from weak dual random coil/␤-sheet to dominant ␤-sheet (Fig.
With SDS present, AChE 584 -594 remained a mixed random coil/␤-sheet (Fig.
For AChE 589 -598 (HRWSSYMVHW), which was in ␤-sheet-␤-turn-random coil conformation after a 10-min neutralization, double concentration converted it to a strong dominant ␤-sheet conformation (Fig.
In the presence of SDS, AChE 594 -598 (YMVHW) converted from a dominant random coil to a dominant ␤-sheet (Fig.
These results highlight the importance of local peptide context.
Indeed, changing concentrations or the presence of local membranes are likely to influence conformation and in turn amyloidogenesis.
Order of ␤-sheet competence is as follows: AChE 590 -598 Ͼ AChE 582-594 Ͼ AChE 585-593 ϭ AChE 584 -594 Ͼ AChE 591-601 .

Key fibrillization residues
To study fibrillization kinetics of T40 -IDE peptides, we used a classical amyloid dye, ThT, that intercalates in ␤-sheet amyloid structures, and we assessed changes in its fluorescence emission
Shaking was used to accelerate fibrillization and was necessary for some peptides.
AChE 586 -599 was a positive control with well-established fibrillization kinetics
AChE 586 -599 fibrillization showed biphasic behavior: first, rapid assembly (Ͻ1 h) followed by a short plateau and decreased ThT signal, and a second slower assembly (Ͼ5 h) followed by the same effects (Fig.
This behavior was previously shown to be triggered by assay shaking and thought to arise from susceptibility to breakage by shear forces or increasing surface area and peptide recruitment
Also as previously found, the decay of ThT signal after the plateau sug-

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
gested that AChE 586 -599 assembly was not stable under these conditions.
At 100 M, only six peptides fibrillized, all (except AChE 585-597 ) with significantly longer nucleation (lag phase), leading to a much lower plateau than AChE 586 -599 (Fig.
For each, except AChE 585-597 , the assembly was stable, and plateau ThT signals did not decay.
The order of fibrillization competence was as follows: AChE 585-597 Ͼ AChE 590 -598 Ͼ AChE 589 -598 Ͼ AChE 591-601 Ͼ AChE 584 -594 Ͼ AChE 584 -603 .
At 200 M, the lag phase of the poorest peptide, AChE 584 -594 , was significantly reduced (ϳ13.3 to ϳ2.6 h), and its plateau height more than doubled (1155 to 2699 a.u.) (Fig.
At 200 M, AChE 589 -599 fibrillized but slowly and weakly (lag phase of 16.7 h and plateau height of 333 a.u.) (Fig.
We then examined the aggregation status of the fibrillizing T40/IDE peptides by EM (Fig.
All fibrillizing peptides were clearly aggregated into dense meshworks of fibrils (top panel for each peptide), with individual typical amyloid fibrils clearly identifiable (lower panel for each peptide).
Most fibrillizing peptides adopted a degree of ␤-sheet conformation after neutralization.
The nonfibrillizing AChE 582-594 showed both a ␤-sheet and ␤-turn conformation, the latter pos-sibly hindering amyloid cross-␤-sheet formation.
Similarly, the nonfibrillizing AChE 589 -599 and AChE 594 -598 mainly adopted a random coil conformation but also had some ␤-sheets and ␤-turns.
These results indicate the importance of YMVH as only T40 -IDE peptides containing it fibrillized (except AChE 584 -594 ).

AChE 590 -598 and AChE 585-597 are seeds for fibrillization of other AChE-derived peptides
AChE 585-597 (KAEFHRWSSYMVH) and AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW) were the two best in terms of fibrillization.
As these two peptides were unlikely to fibrillize by themselves in vivo, we investigated whether the monomers could interact with other T40 -IDE peptides and AChE 586 -599 monomers to enhance fibrillization.
Co-fibrillization of T40 -IDE peptide monomers with 50 M AChE 590 -598 or AChE 585-597 monomers triggered fibrillization of T40 -IDE peptides that would not fibrillize by themselves at either 50 or 100 M (AChE 575-593 , AChE 582-594 , AChE 585-593 , AChE 589 -599 , and AChE 594 -598 ), or at 50 M (AChE 584 -594 ) (Fig.
In contrast to AChE 585-597 , AChE 590 -598 also shortened the lag phase and increased the plateau height of AChE 586 -599 .

Key residues for surface activity
Many amyloids are amphiphilic and surface-active, allowing efficient adsorption to hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces (HHI)
HHIs act as fibrillization catalysts due to a concentrating effect and promotion of peptide chain alignments that favor ␤-sheet formation.
This is important because in vivo HHIs, cellular membranes (phospholipid bilayers with a hydrophilic outer layer and a hydrophobic core), are structurally and functionally damaged by amyloids
Because surface activity plays a major role in amyloid toxicity, it was important to assess surface activity of the T40 -IDE peptides.
We used a previously described technique based on an off-axial light beam to measure the meniscus lensing effect
Normalizing the apparent optical density at the offset using optical density measured on the central axis (⌬OD) gave values that correlated strongly and inversely with surface tension (R Ͼ0.97)
AChE 586 -599 surfactant activity was previously found highly pH-dependent, with little surface activity at acidic pH, likely due to histidine protonation
Hence, we began testing surface activity of the T40 -IDE peptides by measuring differential absorbance (⌬OD) at acidic and neutral pH (Fig.
AChE 584 -603 , AChE 575-593 , and AChE 585-593 had weaker surface activity (smaller ⌬OD) than AChE 586 -599 , and AChE 594 -598 surface activity was similar to that of AChE 586 -599 .
All other peptides were more surface-active than AChE 586 -599 (higher ⌬OD) after 2 min at neutral pH.
Assessing temporal patterns of surfactant activity after neutralization, most peptides were not stably surface-active (Fig.
This suggests that they quickly adsorbed at the air-water interface after neutralization, but subsequent partial decreases in surface activity may reflect conformational changes at the air-water interface to reduce effects on surface energy.
In contrast, surface activities of AChE 586 -599 , AChE 584 -603 , AChE 590 -598 , and AChE 591-601 were stable, suggesting these peptides remained associated with the air-water interface all along.
Orders of competent surface activity were as follows: AChE 590 -598 Ͼ AChE 591-601 ϭ AChE 582-594 Ͼ AChE 585-597 Ͼ AChE 584 -594 ϭ AChE 589 -599 Ͼ AChE 589 -598 Ͼ AChE 594 -598 .

T40 -IDE peptides act as heterologous seeds to promote A␤ fibrillization
We examined the ability of the T40 -IDE peptides to promote A␤ fibrillization.
We used 2 M peptide seeds, not monomers, to assess heterologous seeding of 15 M A␤.
These conditions were identical to Jean et al.

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
for direct comparison with their previous studies on hAChE effects on A␤ fibrillogenesis.
Seed concentration is the initial monomer concentration used to prepare them.
By themselves they did not contribute to ThT signals in test wells, as they did not generate signals over background (data not shown).
Moreover, seed-ThT values (no A␤) were subtracted from all test assays with A␤.
Without seeds, A␤ showed a plateau height of ϳ1095 a.u.
after an ϳ43.4-h lag and an elongation rate of ϳ 89.7 a.u./h (Fig.
The positive control, 2 M AChE 586 -599 seeds, reduced A␤ lag phase 1.4-fold and its plateau height 1.2-fold (Fig.
Similar seeding activity for AChE 586 -599 seeds was previously observed
With the exception of AChE 584 -603 seeds, all other T40 -IDE seeds reduced A␤ lag phase significantly, with AChE 589 -599 being most effective.
The seeds of AChE 584 -603 , AChE 585-597 , AChE 584 -594 , AChE 585-593 ,

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
AChE 590 -598 , and AChE 594 -598 accelerated A␤ elongation rate (from 1.1-to 1.3-fold), with AChE 584 -603 seeds being the most effective (Fig.
All peptide seeds, except those of AChE 584 -603 , increased A␤ plateau height (from 1.1-to 1.2fold), with AChE 585-593 being the most effective (Fig.

Specificity of new antisera against AChE 590 -598
After characterizing T40 -IDE peptides, RWSSYMVHW (AChE 590 -598 ) emerged as the most amyloidogenic.
It had the strongest propensity for conversion to ␤-strand, the strongest surface activity, the best at adopting ␤-sheet conformation, was second best at fibrillizing, and fair at A␤ seeding.
Therefore, two rabbit polyclonal antibodies, 3313 and 3314, were produced using C-Ahx-AChE 590 -598 acid coupled at the N terminus to KLH as an antigen.
Specificity of these antibodies was tested by immunoblot using T40 -IDE peptides (monomers or seeds), T40, hAChE-S, and A␤ (monomers and fibrils) as antigens and were compared with that of Mab 105A, specific to AChE 586 -599 in a ␤-sheet conformation (Fig.
Importantly, neither Mab 105A nor polyclonal 3313 and 3314 cross-reacted with A␤ monomers or fibrils, despite using an amount of A␤ fibrils far above that found in vivo (Fig.
The extremely low reactivity against A␤ fibrils seen in the immunoblots with 3313 and 3314 was a nonspecific cross-reactivity by the polyclonal secondary antibodies anti-rabbit (probably due to the inherent stickiness of fibrils) (Fig.
For 105A, its previously published specificity, established by scanning alanine mutant recognition, for AChE 586 -599 was confirmed in two ways
First, 105A epitope was mapped by using 105A as a bait to select, from a large random peptide phage library, clones expressing short seven-residue peptides bearing its epitope (supporting Experimental procedures).
With this technique, the previously mapped epitope specificity of 105A was confirmed to be AxFHR (Fig.
Second, the recognition of AChE 586 -599 was the strongest by slot-blot (Fig.
105A also recognized AChE 584 -603 monomers and hAChE-S,

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
but the signal was much fainter.
Importantly, ␣-helical T40 was not recognized, confirming 105A specificity for ␤-sheet conformations.
Polyclonal 3313 reacted strongly against monomers of the immunization peptide and of AChE 584 -603 .
Significant reactivity was also detected for seeds of the immunization peptide and of AChE 585-597 and T40.
Low-level reactivity was observed for AChE 585-597 /AChE 589 -598 monomers, seeds of AChE 584 -603 / AChE 585-597 /AChE 584 -594 , and hAChE-S.
Polyclonal 3314 re-acted strongly against AChE 584 -603 monomers and AChE 585-597 seeds.
Significant reactivity was also detected for seeds of AChE 584 -603 /AChE 589 -598 /AChE 590 -598 , AChE 586 -599 , and hAChE-S.
Low-level reactivity was observed for monomers of AChE 575-593 /AChE 585-597 , seeds of AChE 584 -594 /AChE 586 -599 /immunization peptide, and T40.
The specificity of 3313 and 3314 is explained by the fact that most T40 -IDE peptides either adopted a ␤-sheet conformation or fibrillized.
Exceptions were fibrillizing AChE 591-601 that is not recognized and nonfibrillizing and random coil AChE 575-593 that is weakly recognized by 3314.
To summarize, 3313 and 3314 share some similar specificities for peptides that fibrillize, although the recognition level for individual peptides vary.
However, 3313 and 3314 specificities differ from 105A.
The strong target all three antibodies share is for AChE 584 -603 monomers, which contains both the 105A epitope (FHR) and the full sequence of immunization peptide AChE 590 -598 for 3313 and 3314

Distribution of A␤, hAChE-S, hAChE-S-related species, and ThS-positive plaques
We next performed immunolabeling of coronal sections of brain from 12-month-old control, hAChE-S, or hAPPswe single transgenic mice (Tg2576, APP 695 isoform), and hAChE-S/ hAPPswe double transgenic mice to probe for presence of hAChE-S-derived peptides.
To visualize hAChE-S, we used mouse Mab HR2 anti-cerebellar hAChE-S and rabbit polyclonal KD69 anti-␣ helical T40 (which recognizes globular intact hAChE-S but also ␣-helical T40 in isolation)
To visualize A␤ species, we used mouse-specific Mab Bam10 anti-A␤ (first 12 residues).
To detect ␤-sheet amyloid species, ThS was used.
To detect hAChE-S species in a ␤-sheet conformation, we used specific mouse Mab 105A anti-AChE 586 -599
To detect hAChE-S species derived from cleavage of T40, we used our two new rabbit polyclonal antibodies 3313 and 3314.
ThS and all antibodies were negative on sections from WT mice (Fig.
The only reactivity in sections from hAChE-S mice was with HR2 and KD69 recognizing globular hAChE-S, as expected because such mice do not develop amyloid plaques (Fig.
In sections of hAPPswe mice, numerous mature plaques could be identified by single antibody labeling (Fig.
Some of these plaques clearly contained A␤ species (labeled with Bam10), but also AChE-S (labeled with HR2) and AChE-S in ␤-sheet conformation (labeled with 105A, black arrowheads).
Some plaques labeled only with anti-AChE-S antibodies, either anti-intact or anti-AChE-S domains (examples marked by blue arrowheads).
There was clearly some peroxidase activity on sections incubated with KD69, 3313, and 3314.
The brown color was darker and localized in more specific areas than the controls (no first antibody, only biotinylated secondary antibody, avidin-peroxidase, and DAB).
But no plaques were obvious.
Similarly, numerous mature plaques were identified by single antibody labeling in sections of hAPPswe/hAChE mice (Fig.
Several Bam10-positive plaques were clearly bigger than in hAPPswe mice.
ThS confirmed their amyloid nature (Fig.
Labeling with avidin fluorescein reduced nonspecific background but clearly raised the specific signal above background in 3313 and

3314.
Each antibody highlighted mature plaques in the same brain areas detected by peroxidase/DAB staining.
In single and double transgenic brain sections, plaques were mainly detected in the cerebral and olfactory cortices and a few in the olfactory bulb (e.g.
ThS, Bam10, and 3314) (Fig.
In the cerebral cortex section studied (rostral level), all subareas (motor, orbital, and prelimbic) showed plaques, with stronger fluorescence in the motor sub-area with some reagent/ antibodies (e.g.
ThS, KD69, Bam10, and 3314).
In the olfactory cortex (anterior olfactory nucleus), plaques were detected in all sub-areas.
In the olfactory bulb (main and accessory), the plaques appeared more restricted to the granular layer.
When the area occupied by each fluorescent labeling, in the whole brain section of hAPPswe/hAChE double transgenic, was quantitated, it became evident that each individual antibody labeled only a small portion of the area labeled with ThS (Fig.
Indeed, KD69 labeling occupied an area only ϳ9.9% that of ThS, Bam10 labeling 13.3%, 105A labeling 1.3%, 3313 labeling 2.8%, and 3314 labeling 25.4%.
The same relationship was found when the overall intensity of the fluorescent labeling by each antibody was measured, with KD69 labeling intensity only ϳ8.9% that of ThS, Bam10 labeling 25%, 105A labeling 3.8%, 3313 labeling 3.8%, and 3314 labeling 20.3% (Fig.
These results clearly suggest that A␤ and hAChE-S related species only represent a fraction of the overall amyloid burden.

hAChE-S related species in a ␤-sheet conformation are located in plaques and colocalize with A␤
We subsequently addressed by double-fluorescent labeling whether amyloid-positive plaques contained hAChE-S of various kinds, including intact, truncated, ␣-helical, or ␤-sheet.
In the cerebral cortex of hAPPswe mice, mature amyloid plaques could be detected, which labeled with anti-A␤ Bam10 and ThS (Fig.
The A␤ species showed some degree of colocalization with mouse AChE-S (HR2) (68.6% of Bam10 labeling overlapping with that of HR2, and 10.2% of HR2 labeling overlapping with that of Bam10) and mouse AChE-S species with ␣-helical

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
T40 (KD69) (61.8% of Bam10 labeling overlapping with that of KD69, and 36.2% of KD69 labeling overlapping with that of Bam10), with mouse AChE-S surrounding the A␤ species (Fig.
Human AChE T40 and mouse equivalent differ by only one amino acid conservative substitution, Asp 609 in human to Glu 609 in mouse.
Therefore, K69 should recognize both human and mouse T40 sequences, as observed.
Moreover, the entire hAChE-S and mouse AChE-S amino acid sequences share 88.4% identity, with 71 substitutions among which 43 are conservative, 10 are semi-conservative, and 18 are nonconservative.
Moreover, HR2 was also seen to cross-react with mouse AChE-S by immunofluorescence in mouse Neuro-2 neuroblastoma cells (GeneTex and Abcam).
Thus, it is not surprising that KD69 and HR2 recognize mouse AChE-S.
105A and 3313/3314 also labeled plaques (Figs.
105 epitope (Phe 588 -His 589 -Arg 590 ) and 3313/3314 immunizing peptide AChE 590 -598 are identical between human and mouse.
Because the Ide gene is conserved between human and mouse, it would be highly likely that mouse T40 -IDE peptides would be generated from mouse AChE-S.
105A labeling of mouse AChE-S ␤-sheet species was found at the core of mature plaques, colocalizing with A␤ (10.4% of Bam10 labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 68.3% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of Bam10) and ␤-sheet amyloid species (32.4% of ThS labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 77.2% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of ThS), and surrounded by ␣-helical species of mouse AChE-S (16.3% of HR2 labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 67.4% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of HR2; 7.7% of KD69 labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 51.4% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of KD69) (Fig.
Both 3313 and 3314 antisera labeled mouse AChE-S in mature plaques containing an amyloid mass (ThS) and A␤ species (Bam10) (Fig.
Indeed, 69 and 31.4% of ThS labeling overlapped with that of 3313 and 3314, respectively; 68.2 and 87.4% of 3313 and 3314 labeling, respectively, overlapped with that of ThS; 55.8 and 81.8% of Bam10 labeling overlapped with that of 3313 and 3314, respectively, and 27 and 23.8% of 3313 and 3314 labeling, respectively, overlapped with that of Bam10.
Moreover, 3313 and 3314 labeling colocalized but also surrounded that of mouse AChE-S ␤-sheet species (65.2 and 61% of 105A labeling overlapped with that of 3313 and 3314 respectively, and 4.9 and 8.2% of 3313 and 3314 labeling, respectively, overlapped with that of 105A).
Mature plaques in the cerebral cortex of hAChE-S/hAPPswe mice contained hAChE-S (KD69 and HR2) and A␤ species (Bam10) (Fig.
The A␤ species showed some degree of colocalization with hAChE-S (73.4% of Bam10 labeling overlapping with that of HR2 and 20.3% of HR2 labeling overlapping with that of Bam10; 65.4% of Bam10 labeling overlapping with that of KD69 and 35.8% of KD69 labeling overlapping with that of Bam10), and both hAChE-S (HR2 and KD69) and hAChE-S species with ␣-helical T40 (KD69) surrounded the A␤ species.
This labeling pattern is reminiscent of that observed in AD with hAChE-S being associated with senile plaques
Importantly, hAChE-S ␤-sheet species (105A) were detected in mature plaques, representing only a proportion of the hAChE-S present (14.7% of HR2 labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 73.1% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of HR2), and surrounded by ␣-helical forms (6.5% of KD69 labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 40.2% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of KD69) (Fig.
The plaque hAChE-S ␤-sheet staining partly co-localized with ␤-sheet amyloid species (12.1% of ThS labeling overlapping with that of 105A and 47.9% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of ThS) and A␤ species (5.5% of Bam10 labeling overlapping with that of 105A, and 38.6% of 105A labeling overlapping with that of Bam10).
In each case, the plaque hAChE-S ␤-sheet species tended to be centrally located within the mass of amyloids.
3313-and 3314labeled hAChE-S species associated with fibrillar amyloids (38.7 and 42% of ThS labeling overlapped with that of 3313 and 3314, respectively, and 75 and 79.6% of 3313 and 3314 labeling, respectively, overlapped with that of ThS), A␤ species (49.1 and 86.2% of Bam10 labeling overlapped with that of 3313 and 3314, respectively, and 17.3 and 13.2% of 3313 and 3314 labeling, respectively, overlapped with that of Bam10), and ␤-sheets hAChE-S species (50.6 and 32.8% of 105A labeling overlapped with that of 3313 and 3314, respectively, and 10.1 and 6.7% of 3313 and 3314 labeling, respectively, overlapped with that of 105A) (Fig.
The patterns of colocalization appeared whenever plaques were detected.
The species detected by both 3313 and 3314 appeared to represent only a proportion of the fibrillar amyloids (compare, for example, ThS versus 3313 or 3314; see above) and to be centrally localized within the amyloid burden.
In contrast, when compared with A␤ species (Bam10) or hAChE-S ␤-sheet species (105A), the hAChE-S species labeled with 3313 not only colocalized with the A␤ and hAChE-S ␤-sheet species but extended to the surrounding areas as if

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
encapsulating those in their center.
Interestingly, the pattern with 3314 was different.
Some colocalization was observed with A␤ and hAChE-S ␤-sheet species, but 3314 also labeled hAChE-S species in discrete and distinct areas from these (Fig.
Moreover, the labeling of both 3313 and 3314 overlapped to some degree with that of HR2 (globular part of AChE-S) and that of KD69 (␣-helical T40) (Fig.
This suggests that 3313 and 3314 also recognize, to some level, AChE-S in an in vivo context.
These experiments provide the first in vivo evidence of the conformation of hAChE-S-related species located in senile mature plaques and colocalizing with A␤ species and fibrillar amyloids.

Discussion
We previously showed that IDE-dependent cleavage of hAChE-S nonamyloidogenic and ␣-helical oligomerization domain, T40, generates new peptide species
As a mixture, they form ␤-sheets, are surface-active, assemble into amyloid protofibrils, and seed A␤ aggregation.
In monomeric G1 AChE-S, T40 remains exposed and susceptible to proteolysis, even in bovine AChE-S tetramers
Despite clues pointing at T40, the exact nature of the hAChE-S domain involved remains uncertain
Thus, identifying IDE-derived amyloidogenic hAChE-S species should provide targets to characterize and identify brain fibrillogenic hAChE-S species.
Eleven hAChE-S peptides from IDE-dependent cleavage of T40 were assessed singly rather than mixtures, as amyloidogenic species.
Two T40 regions had exceptionally strong ␤-sheet propensity, WKAEFHR and SYMVHWK.
The two peptides with strongest propensity contained the latter region, AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW) and AChE 594 -598 (YMVHW).
In terms of conformation, we identified negative effects of the T40 N terminus.
At the lowest concentration, after neutralization, only AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW) adopted a dominant

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
␤-sheet conformation.
At higher concentrations or in the presence of SDS as a membrane-mimicking agent, other peptides also adopted a ␤-sheet conformation (e.g.
AChE 589 -598 , HRWSSYMVHW).
These results imply that the in vivo environment, in which these peptides are found (e.g.
vicinity of cellular membranes), drastically influences their amyloidogenic behavior.
AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW) was the most surfaceactive peptide, a property involved in amyloid toxicity.
Only six peptides could fibrillize by themselves, most of them able to adopt a degree of ␤-sheet conformation and containing YMVH.
Individually, AChE 585-597 (KAEFHRWSSYMVH) and AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW), the best two fibrillizing peptides, allowed fibrillization of T40 -IDE peptides that did not fibrillize alone.
Importantly, most individual peptide seeds, except AChE 584 -603 , significantly reduced A␤ lag phase, with AChE 590 -598 (RWSSYMVHW) among the most effective.
We identified RWSSYMVHW (AChE 590 -598 ) as the most amyloidogenic peptide and generated two new polyclonal antibod-

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
ies against it, 3313 and 3314.
These recognized peptides that fibrillize or adopt a ␤-sheet conformation, although recognition levels varied.
They also had a different specificity to Mab 105A, except for recognizing AChE 584 -603 (WKAEFHR-WSSYMVHWKNQFD).
Having created and characterized specific new reagents against hAChE-S T40-derived species of diverse properties, we probed for hAChE-S-derived peptides or hAChE-S with a still attached but proteolytically digested T40 in brains of 12-month-old controls, hAChE-S or hAPPswe single transgenic mice (Tg2576, APP 695 isoform), and hAChE-S/hAPPswe double transgenic mice.
In hAChE-S mice, the transgene had been shown to provide greater AChE-S activity in cerebral cortex, doubling the total AChE-S activity but triggering no plaque formation
Therefore, it was unsurprising that only antibodies against globular hAChE-S (HR2) and T40 (KD69) achieved labeling.
By 8 -9 months, hAPPswe mice began developing classic amyloid plaques in cerebral cortex, as we saw with ThS and anti-A␤ Bam10 in 12-month-old mice
The plaques were also rich with HR2 and KD69 labeling.
A␤ treatment of cultured mouse neuroblastoma and mouse primary neuronal cultures triggers elevated levels of mouse AChE-S expression and activity
Despite an overall decrease of hAChE-S activity in human AD patient brains, it rises in amyloid plaques and NFT at very early stages of amyloid deposition
Also, various hAPP transgenic mice showed selective elevation of mouse AChE activity in brain areas linked to severe AD pathology, in particular cores of amyloid plaques in the neocortex, as we saw with Mab 105A anti-AChE 586 -599
Some hAPP mouse models also have higher levels of G1 monomeric mouse AChE-S (62).
Moreover, in pathologically relevant cortical extracts of Tg2576 mice, A␤ deposition began as early as 4 months before overt pathology began, and the activity of abnormal glycosylated G1 forms of mouse AChE was rising
These A␤-triggered elevations of mouse AChE-S, potentially proteolytically susceptible monomeric G1 forms, combined with high amino acid homology in hAChE-S and its mouse equivalent, explain plaque labeling by HR2, KD69, 105A, 3313, and 3314 in the Tg2576 mice but only in the context of human A␤ plaque deposition.
We saw no labeling in WT mice with mouse APP and AChE-S that never develop plaques
hAChE-S is also elevated in human brain tissue immediately adjacent to amyloid plaques
Therefore, local neurons reacting to increased levels of soluble A␤, A␤ deposition, and amyloid burden, in general, could drive AChE-S expression.
In turn, proteolytic impact of highly expressed AChE-S could generate amyloidogenic ␤-sheet species and create a vicious circle of further A␤ seeding or deposition.

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
In hAPPswe and hAPPswe/hAChE mice, amyloid plaques were detected in brain areas relevant for AD.
Indeed, in the cerebral cortex, the motor, orbital, and prelimbic sub-areas all labeled with plaques, as observed in human AD.
These cortical sub-areas are also among the most heavily affected by A␤ burden in another mouse model of AD (b6.Cg-Tg(APPswe/ PSEN1De9)85Dbo/j, chimeric mouse/human APPswe, and human presenilin-1 gene lacking exon 9) (67).
In the orbitofrontal cortex of ϳ16-month-old Tg2576 transgenic mice, A␤ deposition was modest
Likewise, the motor cortex in 12-month-old double transgenic mice tested with all our antibodies/reagents showed the heaviest amyloid burden, with fewer plaques in the orbital area
In the olfactory bulb and cortex of Tg2576 transgenic mice, nonfibrillar A␤ deposition and plaque appearance occur earlier than in any other brain areas (6 months), with deposition in the olfactory bulb as one of the earliest pathological changes
ThS stained mainly the olfactory bulb granule layer, and A␤ deposition occurred across other layers as the mice aged, correlating with progressive olfactory impairments, resembling those in human AD.
In the olfactory cortex and bulb of our double transgenic mice, the observed plaque repartition (anterior olfactory nucleus and granular layer of the bulb) was similar to that described in Tg2576 and b6.Cg-Tg mouse models
These areas had among the heaviest amyloid burden.
Senile plaques and NFT are commonly found in human olfactory cortex and bulb, and also in brain regions receiving input from it
In human dementia, the anterior olfactory nucleus has reduced neuron density, shows NFTs, with number and densities paralleling dementia severity, and contains mature senile plaques when dementia is severe.
Thus, in our AD mouse model, amyloid species, A␤, and AChE-S species accumulate in plaques in various and distinct brain regions that parallel those in other AD mouse models and more importantly in human AD
Mature plaques in the cerebral cortex of our double transgenic mice contained hAChE-S, hAChE-S species, ␤-sheet amyloid species, and A␤.
Both intact hAChE-S (HR2 and KD69) and hAChE-S species with ␣-helical T40 (KD69) surrounded the ␤-sheet amyloid (ThS) and A␤ (Bam10).
In contrast, hAChE-S species (3313 and 3314) and hAChE-S species with a ␤-sheet conformation (105A) colocalized with ␤-sheet amyloid (ThS) and A␤ species (Bam10) at a more central location within the amyloid burden.
In human AD brains, histochemistry for cholinesterase activity showed that both the central core of plaques and its surrounding rim stained strongly and consistently, which also labeled with ThS and Mab 4G8 anti-A␤
hAChE activity was also found associated with mature amyloid plaques, both at the neuritic core and periph-

ery, by EM of human AD brains
Our findings are in perfect agreement with previous reports.
Although linked to AD pathology, and in contrast to APP and A␤, hAChE-S has been neglected in terms of understanding its role and physiology during AD.
Prior research mostly focused on inhibiting cholinesterase activity for short-term symptomatic relief.
Clearly, the relationships among cholinergic dysfunction, cognitive deficit, and pathological structures remain poorly understood.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate conformations adopted by hAChE-S within plaques and the presence of hAChE-S-related species.
Our experiments provide the first in vivo evidence that many A␤-containing amyloid plaques become associated with hAChE-S in ␣-helical conformation and related species in ␤-sheet conformation.
The ␤-sheet species may be the result of proteolytic cleavage generating either T40-derived isolated amyloidogenic peptides and/or shortened and amyloidogenic T40 not released from the hAChE-S globular part.
We also show that some individual species generated by proteolytic digestion of hAChE-S T40 domain adopt a ␤-sheet conformation, are surface active, highly amyloidogenic, and able to seed A␤.
This sets the stage for further studies on pathologically relevant A␤-hAChE-S interactions (e.g.
seeding) in hAChE/hAPPswe mice.
Using double transgenic mice for such purposes has previously proven valid and successful
As in prion disease, the spread of AD pathology may be due to template-directed misfolding by progressive seeding of amyloid aggregation, which can spread into adjacent and interconnected neurons
This is supported by the following evidence: in mice that do not normally develop AD pathology, induced A␤ deposition occurs de novo in brain areas (e.g.
cortex) far from the original hippocampal injection site of brain extracts from AD patients; induction of senile plaques in the brains of primates by intracerebral injection of human AD brain homogenates; and seeded A␤ aggregation in an APP transgenic mouse model by intracerebral infusion of AD brain extracts
In AD, amyloid propagation and dissemination to neighboring neurons or brain areas is conceivable for A␤ as it is naturally present in the extracellular space and can diffuse widely without needing to cross membranes.
In mammals, globular hAChE-S is mostly a G1 soluble monomer and a G4 tetrameric membrane-bound form
As AD progresses, there is selective reduction or loss of G4 tetramers and a rise in G1 monomers in cerebral cortex and cerebrospinal fluid
Furthermore, in cerebral cortex of severely affected AD patients with heavy A␤ loads, G4 hAChE-S activity falls ϳ50%, and G1 forms rise
Rising G1 activity also correlates positively with density of cortical

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
amyloid deposits.
In bovines, AChE T40 is vulnerable to proteolysis even in tetramers and is naturally cleaved or truncated in fetal bovine serum G1 AChE
Hence, in AD, it is plausible that increased hAChE-S G1 forms that would be extracellular, soluble, and with a proteolytically susceptible T40 could lead to the generation of hAChE-S-derived amyloidogenic species able to seed A␤ aggregation.
To date, therapies for diseases like AD do not modify the pathological process but only offer temporary symptomatic alleviation.
Template-directed misfolding by seeding of A␤ by hAChE-S, but also cellular dissemination of amyloidogenic species, could offer novel therapeutic strategies to delay propagation by stabilizing native protein conformations.

Experimental procedures

Synthetic peptides, antibodies, and mouse brains
Lyophilized T40 -IDE-derived peptides and synthetic human A␤ 1-40 (EZBiolab, Carmel, IN) were purchased already purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a C18 column.
Before use, the T40 -IDE peptides were resuspended at 2 mg/ml in water, and A␤ was resuspended in DMSO at 1.6 mM.
A␤ was then sonicated and centrifuged for 1 h at 15,000 ϫ g at 4 °C (to remove any pre-aggregated species).
DMSO was used to main-tain A␤ in a monomeric pool lacking any ␤-sheet secondary structures
Specific mouse Mab 105A anti-AChE 586 -599 in a ␤-sheet conformation and rabbit polyclonal KD69 anti-␣ helical T40 were previously described
Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-AChE 590 -598 , named 3313 and 3314, were produced by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Billingham, Cleveland, UK) using C-Ahx-AChE 590 -598 -acid coupled at the N terminus to KLH as an antigen, via standard immunization procedures.
Other antibodies used were mouse Mab HR2 anti-cerebellar hAChE-S and Mab Bam10 anti-A␤ (first 12 residues).
Brains from 12-month-old WT control, hAChE-S single transgenic, hAPPswe single transgenic (Tg2576, APP 695 isoform), and hAChE-S/hAPPswe double transgenic mice were from the Brimijoin lab

The mean spectra of multiple scans (speed, 50 nm min Ϫ1 , response time 4 s) were collected at 20 °C in a quartz cuvette (1-mm path length) using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter.
The spectra

Conformation of hAChE-S species in senile plaques
were blank subtracted and normalized to molar ellipticity.
At least three independent assays were performed.
Statistical analysis was by two-sample t test.
To determine the percentage of secondary structures, the CD spectra were analyzed with CONTINLL from the CDPro package

Fibrillization experiments
100 or 200 M T40 -IDE peptides were incubated with 165 M ThT in PBS in a 100-l reaction volume.
ThT fluorescence (excitation 450 nm and emission 480 nm) was measured daily in 96-well plates (black wall, clear bottom, Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK), at 37 °C every 6.7 min with 5-min orbital shaking after every measurement and on a BMG Polarstar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, UK) using a bottom-bottom configuration (optical fiber system detecting emission signal from the bottom of the well).
Values in control wells (ThT/buffer) were subtracted from those of test wells (ThT/peptide).
Kinetic parameters were calculated as follows: elongation rate was calculated from slope at the sigmoidal curve inflection point; plateau height was calculated by averaging the highest curve values (minimum of five); and the lag phase was calculated from the intercept on the time axis of the line tangent to the inflection point.
Three or more independent assays were performed and analyzed each with two-sample t-tests.

Co-fibrillization
50 M T40 -IDE peptides were incubated with 50 M AChE 590 -598 or AChE 585-597 , or 15 M A␤ was incubated with 15 M T40 -IDE peptides, and the fibrillization experiments were carried as described above.

Heterologous seeding
200 M T40 -IDE peptides in PBS were fibrillized for 2 h at room temperature with continuous shaking to generate seeds, and 15 M A␤ 1-40 (DMSO stock) was incubated with 165 M ThT in PBS (100 l reaction volume), with or without 2 M T40 -IDE peptide seeds.
ThT fluorescence was measured as described under "Fibrillization experiments," but readings were taken every 21 min, with 5 min shaking after each read.
Control wells contained ThT, buffers, and 2 M seeds when required.
Values in control wells (ThT/buffer with or without seeds) were subtracted from those in test wells (A␤ with or without seeds), ensuring that the seeds did not affect ThT fluorescence.
Transmission EM 100 M T40 -IDE peptides were harvested when the plateau phase was reached (as measured by ThT fluorescence emission).
The solutions were adsorbed onto Formvar-coated 400 mesh copper grids, air-dried, washed with distilled water, negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, and viewed with a Tecnai electron microscope (Philips).

Surface activity measurement
Analyses were performed as described previously
Stock solutions of T40 -IDE peptides were diluted to 50 M in 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 2 (100 l final volume), and dispensed in a 96-well plate (black wall, clear bottom; Greiner Bio-One).
Sur-face activity was measured at 37 °C, before and after neutralization with 20 l of 1 M NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.2, at 450 nm on a BMG Polarstar plate reader at the central and offset positions.
⌬OD ϭ (OD offset Ϫ OD central ) neutral pH 2 min Ϫ (OD offset Ϫ OD central ) neutral pH .
Three or more independent assays were performed and analyzed by two-sample t test.

Immunoblot
To generate seeds, T40 -IDE peptides were fibrillized (see above).
A␤ fibrils were generated by incubating 199 M 〈␤ in PBS and leaving it for 1 week at 37 °C under shaking conditions. 2 g of T40 -IDE peptide or peptide seeds, T40, A␤, A␤ fibrils, and 1 g of hAChE-S were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane.
This was blocked with 0.4% fish skin gelatin in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody 3313 or 3314, or mouse Mab 105A, followed by anti-rabbit or antimouse IgG conjugated to HRP.
Products were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.

Immunolabeling and confocal microscopy
Deep-frozen mouse brain material from control, single, and double transgenic mice was derived at the Mayo Clinic (Mayo Clinic study conducted under approval of IACUC study protocol A67914-15-R18).
Mouse brains embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound generated 12-m coronal sections kept frozen at Ϫ20 °C until used.
Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature.
ABC mouse-on-mouse (M.O.M.) or Vectastain Elite ABC rabbit IgG kits were used, following the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
To block nonspecific binding of components, avidin and biotin (Vector kit) were applied consecutively for 15 min at room temperature.
With mouse primary antibody, endogenous mouse Ig sections were treated with Vector M.O.M. IgG blocking reagent for 1 h at room temperature before protein blocking with M.O.M. diluent for 5 min at room temperature.
With rabbit primary antibodies, sections were treated with Vectastain blocking serum and labeled with one antibody or two.
Singlelabeled sections were incubated with primary antibody (30 min), M.O.M. anti-mouse, or Vectastain anti-rabbit biotinylated antisera (10 min), followed by avidin conjugated to peroxidase (5 min) and DAB as chromagen (2 min, Vector Laboratories), or avidin-FITC conjugate, or Texas red (5 min).
Double-labeled sections were incubated with first antibody as above.
Then, to prevent interactions between first and second labeling sets, Vector avidin and biotin were applied consecutively for 15 min at room temperature.
Then, sections were treated 1 h with M.O.M. IgG blocking diluent or Vectastain normal blocking serum, incubated with a second primary antibody (30 min), M.O.M. anti-mouse or Vectastain anti-rabbit biotinylated antisera (10 min), and avidin conjugated to FITC or to Texas red (5 min).
Finally, section nuclei were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (10 s) before mounting in Mowiol (4 °C overnight).
When required, sections were stained with 1% ThS in water for 5 min at room temperature before mounting.
All imaging used an LSM 510 META microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) on an Axio Imager Z1 with a 40 ϫ 0.75 objec-

tive or a 63 ϫ 1.4 oil immersion lens.
Laser lines were 488 and 543 nm to excite FITC and Texas red, respectively.
Fluorescence was measured with the following filters: bp 505-530 and bp 625-743.
The z stacks were collected with a 16-m interval between slices.
Plaques were examined from at least two different sections per conditions per animal (with the order of the antibody/reagents having been switched for the staining).
For the control animals, WT, and hAChE-S single transgenic, the brain of one animal was examined.
For hAPPswe single transgenic and hAChE-S/hAPPswe double transgenic, the brain of two animals were examined.
Tiling functions of the confocal microscope collected a series of images spanning the whole brain section, with one representative section per condition collected.
Images were analyzed with Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.).
Colocalization (fluorescence overlap) was measured using the FIJI plugin JACoP
Labeling area and intensity were measured in FIJI using a Huang threshold, region of interest manager, and a set measurement analysis.
