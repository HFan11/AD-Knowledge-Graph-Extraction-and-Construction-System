Platycodigenin as Potential Drug Candidate for Alzheimer’s Disease via Modulating Microglial Polarization and Neurite Regeneration
Neuroinflammatory microenvironment, regulating neurite regrowth and neuronal survival, plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
During neuroinflammation, microglia are activated, inducing the release of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors depending on their polarization into classical M1 microglia or alternative M2 phenotype.
Therefore, optimizing brain microenvironment by small molecule-targeted microglia polarization and promoting neurite regeneration might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.
In this study, we found platycodigenin, a naturally occurring triterpenoid, promoted M2 polarization and inhibited M1 polarization in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 and primary microglia.
Platycodigenin downregulated pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO), while upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
Further investigation confirmed that platycodigenin inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) positive M1 but increased Ym1/2 positive M2 microglial polarization in primary microglia.
In addition, platycodigenin significantly decreased LPS-induced the hyperphosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunits.
Furthermore, the inactivation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) induced by LPS was completely ameliorated by platycodigenin.
Platycodigenin also promoted neurite regeneration and neuronal survival after Aβ treatment in primary cortical neurons.
Taken together, our study for the first time clarified that platycodigenin effectively ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation and Aβ-induced neurite atrophy and neuronal death.

Introduction
Microglia, the resident brain macrophages, are the main immuno-modulative cells in the central nervous system (CNS)
Microglia activation is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD)
According to its different roles in immune modulation, microglia can be divided into classically activated M1 and the alternatively activated M2 phenotype
M1 microglia typically release proinflammatory molecules, promote neuroinflammation, and accelerate neuronal death
While activation of M2 microglia increases the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, resulting in neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, oligodendrogenesis, and anti-neuroinflammation
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon (IFN)-γ, or Aβ are known as representative M1 microglial polarization stimulators, while interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, or IL-13 are M2 modulators
A few M1 inhibitive agents, such as cyclooxygenase (Cox)-1 inhibitors, Cox-2 inhibitors have been clinically investigated against neurodegenerative diseases but with little beneficial effects
Thus, only inhibition of M1 microglia is not enough but beneficial M2-skewed microglia activation might also be required for optimizing brain beneficial microenvironment.
Neurite atrophy and synapse loss underlie the pathogenesis of AD and are located upstream of neuronal death in the Aβ cascade
What is more, axonal degeneration probably initiates the onset and progression of neuronal death in AD
Our previous study indicated that neuronal network reconstruction through axonal regeneration was critical for the fundamental memory recovery of AD
Studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines activated microglia and induced aggregation of tau in neurites, promoting neuritic dystrophy and neuronal death
Thus, we consider that neurite regeneration is essential for memory reconstruction and stopping secondary neuronal injury via modulating neuroinflammatory microenvironment is required for the maintenance of regenerated neurites in AD.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, belongs to the nuclear receptor family of ligand-inducible transcription factors, is a known M2 macrophage polarization regulator
PPARγ activation inhibits nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway via inhibition of IκBα degradation, reduction of RelA (p65) nuclear translocation, and disrupted binding of p65 to the DNA, thus suppresses the gene transcription of inflammatory cytokines
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 subunit phosphorylation could induce nucleus-export and loss of PPARγ, led to a wide range of inflammatory responses
In addition, phosphorylation of p38 regulated the association between p65 and p300 via promoting the acetylation of p65, led to increased transcriptional activity of NF-κB
PPAR-γ agonists could attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory response and promote CD206 and Ym1/2 positive M2 microglia polarization
However, pharmacological compounds shown to regulate the transformation of microglia to the M2 phenotype as well as promoting neurite regeneration are rare
Therefore, drug-targeted M2 microglia polarization and neurite regeneration can provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.
Platycodon grandifloras and its main terpenoids platycodigenin-type saponins have been reported for neuroprotective
However, whether platycodigenin exerts anti-inflammatory effects via modulation of microglial polarization and exact molecular mechanism remains unclear.
Moreover, whether platycodigenin could promote neurite regeneration needs to be elucidated.
Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of platycodigenin on the proinflammatory mediators' production in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia and explored the underling molecular mechanisms of microglia polarization.
In addition, we examined the effects of platycodigenin on neurite regeneration and neuronal survival after Aβ treatment in primary cultured cortical neurons.

Results

Platycodigenin Inhibited the Production of NO and Ameliorated the Secretion of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines
To optimize the appropriate concentration of LPS without affecting cell viability, BV2 microglia were treated with LPS (1-1000 ng/mL) for 24 h.
The cell viability was not significantly changed compared with control (Figure
While the NO release was significantly increased from 10-1000 ng/mL LPS treatment (Figure
We chose 100 ng/mL LPS for the following study.
To determine the concentration of platycodigenin without cell toxicity, the cells were treated with increasing doses of platycodigenin from 0.01 to 50 µM for 36 h.
As a result, the cell viability was not changed after 0.01-10 µM platycodigenin treatment, but decreased to 77.1 ± 1.3% compared with control (Figure
Thus, we chose 10 µM platycodigenin as the maximum concentration in subsequent experiments.

LPS-activated microglia showed a strong release of M1-related NO production, which is one of the main inflammatory mediators and plays an important role in neuro-inflammatory diseases
Thus, we investigated the inhibitory effect of platycodigenin on NO production in LPS-induced BV2 microglia.
Compared to control group (4.8 ± 0.1 ng/mL), treatment with LPS significantly increased the production of NO (15.0 ± 0.3 ng/mL).
Pretreatment with platycodigenin significantly reduced the NO production in a dose dependent manner at 0.1 (11.6 ± 0.3 ng/mL), 1 (11.3 ± 0.1 ng/mL) and 10 µM (10.7 ± 0.5 ng/mL) (Figure
In addition, we evaluated the effects of platycodigenin on the LPS-induced production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10, which are important in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases
Compared to control cells, LPS significantly increased the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 while decreased IL-10 in the culture BV2 supernatants (Figure

In addition, platycodigenin ameliorated LPS-induced decrease of IL-10 at 1 µM (Figure

Platycodigenin Promoted LPS-Induced M1 Phenotype to M2 Microglia Polarization
Cox2, CD11b and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are mainly expressed marker proteins in M1 microglia, while Ym1/2, Arginase I, and CD206 are expressed in M2 microglia
We then investigated whether platycodigenin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines release via modulating microglial polarization.
BV2 microglia were pretreated with platycodigenin (0.1, 1 and 10 µM) for 12 h followed by treatment with LPS (100 ng/mL) for another 12 h (Figure
As a result, platycodigenin significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS (Figure
In the contrary, platycodigenin upregulated M2 microglia related mRNA expression of IL4, CD206, Arg1 and TGFβ (Figure
Furthermore, we confirmed the effects of platycodigenin on M2 microglia polarization in primary cultured microglia (Figure
As a result, Cox2 was significantly upregulated and Ym1/2 was downregulated after LPS treatment (Figure
Pretreatment with platycodigenin (1 and 10 µM) following LPS treatment significantly decreased Cox2 expression, whereas Ym1/2 expression was significantly increased.
The results indicated that platycodigenin exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibiting M1 microglial polarization and promoting M2 microglial polarization.

Platycodigenin Attenuated LPS-Induced Activation of MAPK and NF-κB Signaling Pathways
The phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and p65-NF-κB are known to regulate inflammatory mediators and M1 microglial polarization
Thereby, we investigated the expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) MAPK and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) NF-κB in LPS-induced BV2 microglia.
BV2 microglia were treated with platycodigenin (1 and 10 μM) for 12 h following stimulated with LPS for another 1 h, and expression of p-p38 and p-p65 were analyzed by immunocytochemical analysis (Figure
As a result, p38 and p65 were highly phosphorylated after LPS treatment, while platycodigenin significantly downregulated p-p65 and p-p38 (Figure
To confirm the effects of platycodigenin on p38 and p65 phosphorylation, we measured the expression of p-p65 and p-p38 by ELISA kits.
Phosphorylated p38 and p65 were increased from 1.38 and 20.08 ng/mg to 2.78 and 26.57
ng/mg after LPS treatment, respectively.
Platycodigenin treatment significantly downregulated the phosphorylated p65 and p38 (Figure

Platycodigenin as a Potential Agonist for PPARγ
Activation of PPARγ is related to M2 microglial polarization and anti-inflammatory effects
Therefore, we examined the effect of platycodigenin on PPARγ in BV2 microglia (Figure
We found that LPS treatment significantly suppressed PPARγ expression (Figure
Pretreatment with platycodigenin for 12 h restored PPARγ expression to near normal levels (Figure
These results indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of platycodigenin was possibly through suppression of p38 and p65 signaling and activation of PPARγ.

These results indicate that platycodigenin can restore Aβ-induced neuritic atrophy and neuronal death.

Discussion
The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, such as Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangles, create toxic microenvironments that trigger activation of M1 microglia phenotype, a process characterized by morphological and phenotype changes
Conversely, activated M1 microglia release inflammatory cytokines which exacerbate CNS microenvironments, preventing neurites remodeling and recovery of memory function
Therefore, exploring small molecules that regulate microglial polarization and neurites regeneration might be a therapeutic way for the intervention of AD.
In the current study, we demonstrated for the first time that platycodigenin could promote the polarization of LPS-induced M1 microglia to M2 phenotype and enhance neurite regrowth in Aβ-induced axonal atrophy.
Nitric oxide and other reactive nitrogen species have been revealed to induce oxidative stress and enhance expression and DNA binding of NF-κB, promoting neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation
A remarkable increase of M1 associated Cox2 protein leads to overproduction of NO, which are involved in AD
The results of this study suggest that platycodigenin has an inhibitory effect on NO production and attenuates LPS-induced expression of

A remarkable increase of M1 associated Cox2 protein leads to overproduction of NO, which are involved in AD
The results of this study suggest that platycodigenin has an inhibitory effect on NO production and attenuates LPS-induced expression of M1 associated Cox2 protein.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are remarkably increased, while anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL4 are decreased in neuroinflammatory and AD models in vitro and in vivo
We found that platycodigenin significantly inhibited the production of the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine in BV2 microglia.
NF-κB, which is a critical transcriptional factor in regulating oxidative substances and inflammatory cytokines, plays an important role in inflammatory diseases
The phosphorylation of NF-κB subunit p65 promotes its nuclear translocation and association with CBP/p300 or HDAC-1, increasing the inflammatory gene transcription
Furthermore, studies have shown that the transactivation function of NF-κB is dependent on p38 MAPK phosphorylation and p38 mediated p65 acetylation
Thereby, inhibition of p38 and p65 phosphorylation contributes to the reduction of inflammatory response and amelioration of inflammatory diseases.
The present study also showed that platycodigenin inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 and MAPK p38 in BV-2 cells.
PPARγ has been shown to modulate the expression or activity of large numbers of genes in a variety of signaling pathways
Recent animal and clinical studies indicated that PPARγ agonists could prevent inflammatory response and neuronal death in AD
PPARγ agonist not only attenuate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as NO, IL-6, IL-1β, Cox2, iNOS, and TNFα, but also promote the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13.
PPARγ agonist pioglitazone inhibits microglia inflammation by blocking p38 MAPK signaling pathways.
In addition, PPARγ activation inhibits NF-κB activity by inhibiting nuclear translocation of p65 subunit and competing with NF-κB co-activators
Furthermore, PPARγ activation promotes the expression of M2 markers, such as Ym1/2, Arginase I, CD206, and Fizz1
Our results showed that platycodigenin increased the expression of PPARγ, probably resulting in the inhibition of p-p65 and polarization of M1 microglia to M2 microglia.
Neural circuits and network are responsible for memory generalization, consolidation and storage
Aβ-induced synapse loss, axonal degeneration, and neuronal death are contributed to the disruption of neural networks, which most likely relate to memory deficits
Therefore, we hypothesize the neuronal circuits reconstruction through axonal regeneration is critical for the fundamental therapies of AD.
In the current study, by high throughput screening, we found platycodigenin, which could promote neurite regrowth and prevent neuronal death in an Aβ-induced cell model.
However, whether platycodigenin could ameliorate memory deficits in vivo needs to be studied further.
In conclusion, we report for the first time that platycodigenin could effectively prevent LPS-induced M1 microglial polarization and inflammatory response by inhibiting p-p38 and activating PPARγ, thereby blocking NF-κB activation and reducing the production of oxidative mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Furthermore, platycodigenin prevented Aβ25-35-induced neuronal death and promoted neurite regeneration after Aβ25-35-induced neurite atrophy.
Thus, our study exhibited that platycodigenin had the potential for treatment of neuro-inflammation and neuro-degeneration, and can be considered as a promising microglia and neurite modulator for the intervention of AD.
