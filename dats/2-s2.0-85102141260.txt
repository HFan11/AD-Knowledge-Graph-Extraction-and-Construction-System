Brain Ischemia as a Prelude to Alzheimer's Disease
Transient ischemic brain injury causes massive neuronal death in the hippocampus of both humans and animals.
This was accompanied by progressive atrophy of the hippocampus, brain cortex, and white matter lesions.
Furthermore, it has been noted that neurodegenerative processes after an episode of ischemia-reperfusion in the brain can continue well-beyond the acute stage.
Rarefaction of white matter was significantly increased in animals at 2 years following ischemia.
Some rats that survived 2 years after ischemia developed severe brain atrophy with dementia.
The profile of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration shares a commonality with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
Furthermore, post-ischemic brain injury is associated with the deposition of folding proteins, such as amyloid and tau protein, in the intracellular and extracellular space.
Recent studies on post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration have revealed the dysregulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes such as amyloid protein precursor, α-secretase, β-secretase, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and tau protein.
The latest data demonstrate that Alzheimer's disease-related proteins and their genes play a key role in the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration with full-blown dementia in disease types such as Alzheimer's.
Ongoing interest in the study of brain ischemia has provided evidence showing that ischemia may be involved in the development of the genotype and phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that brain ischemia can be considered as a useful model for understanding the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION
Presently, brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease create a huge burden to the healthcare system and caregivers due to the lack of causal treatment.
Both the diseases are the main causes of irreversible disability and dementia worldwide
With increasing numbers of aging in the world, the number of subjects with dementia is forecast to reach 82 million by 2030 and 152 million by 2050
There are no causal treatments that could stop the development of dementia in both patients after stroke and Alzheimer's disease.
For this reason, there is a lot of pressure to increase the understanding of the mechanisms of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration in connection with its recommended relationship with Alzheimer's disease
It is noteworthy that more and more new clinical and experimental studies indicate epidemiological and neuropathological links connecting ischemic brain neurodegeneration with the genotype and phenotype of Alzheimer's disease.
Human investigations have revealed that Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for stroke
Animal studies have also presented a synergistic link between brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease, leading to an increased risk of cognitive decline and development of Alzheimer's disease-type dementia (De la
The main cause of ischemic stroke in humans is atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is also associated with Alzheimer's disease
At least 33% cases of Alzheimer's disease have neuropathological changes resulting from small vessel arteriosclerosis
Atherosclerosis has been found to coexist with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and it also correlates well with cognitive decline
On the other hand, the increased level of amyloid in the post-ischemic brain causes the accumulation of amyloid not only in the brain tissue, but also in the vessel wall, causing the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Reduction in the length of cerebral vessels post-ischemia or impaired cerebral blood flow in the brain as a result of vasoconstriction
This leads to the idea that brain vascular diseases, such as ischemic brain episode, may make the regions in the brain more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease pathology, due to impaired clearance of amyloid from the brain
Alternatively, post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease may finally represent independent but convergent common pathological mechanisms, and can therefore be expected to have common proteomic and genomic risk factors

NEUROPATHOLOGY IN POST-ISCHEMIC NEURODEGENERATION
The death of neurons in the CA1 area of hippocampus develops during 7 days following experimental ischemic episode
Extended survival, following ischemic brain injury up to 2 years, triggers additional pathology in neuronal cells in the hippocampal CA3 region which is resistant to ischemic injury
The same changes are observed in post-stroke cases
In cortex, layers 3, 5, and 6 presented massive neuronal changes
Two years after ischemia, in addition to localized neuron loss, a variety of pathological stages of neuronal cells were observed
The neuronal loss took the form of chronic neuronal damage.
The other alterations with acute character were noted in those areas of the brain, which were not involved in primary ischemic pathology, i.e. in CA2, CA3, and CA4 areas of the hippocampus
Brain ischemia increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to cellular and non-cellular blood elements i.e., platelets and amyloid
In post-ischemic leakage of the blood-brain barrier, two facts deserve attention.
The first one is very important in terms of amyloid extravasations
The ability of the soluble amyloid to pass through the insufficient blood-brain barrier leads to neurotoxic effects on neurons, which may then lead to subsequent increased accumulation of amyloid in post-ischemic brain.
Soluble amyloid is delivered to the brain following ischemia from the circulatory system, and as a consequence, it contributes to brain vasoconstriction, amyloidosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, following brain ischemia
Following brain ischemia in regions with massive neuronal alterations, a powerful inflammatory response was observed
These data indicate that the increase of inflammatory mediators in microglia and astrocytes is directly related to the selective vulnerability of neurons to ischemia
After ischemia, inflammatory factors can trigger a self-sustaining cycle that leads the post-ischemic brain to neurodegeneration.
Interleukin-1 is a key player that stimulates ischemic neurons to amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid protein precursor along with the induction of inflammatory factors.
These processes induce changes in neurons and their loss, with irreversible interruption of the neuronal network.
Consequently, this neuropathology activates microglial cells, which leads to self-propagation of the inflammatory cycle.
Furthermore, it is evident that the amyloid, which is generated following ischemia
In the hippocampus, activation of glial cells precedes neuron loss, and it lasts for a long time after an ischemic episode
Factors released by astrocytes and microglia cells, i.e., matrix metalloproteinases, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor α increase the leakage of the blood-brain barrier
Microglia and astrocytes belong to the first line of defense and are activated a few minutes after ischemia
Increased activation is noted within 2-3 days after ischemia, persisting for years following ischemic brain injury
An increased influx of monocytes in the brain after ischemia was documented within 1 day after ischemia as a result of additional injury to the blood-brain barrier by neuroglial inflammatory factors.
An increased number of monocytes in brain tissue were observed up to 7 days following ischemia
Sooner or later, anti-inflammatory macrophages begin to dominate the brain after ischemia, as they are essential for the processes of regeneration and healing
Another type of cells involved in the immune response induced by ischemia are neutrophils which appear in post-ischemic brain parenchyma immediately after the ischemic insult
The neutrophils focus around damaged areas and release inflammatory factors, proteolytic enzymes, and oxygen free radicals that initiate secondary damage to the already damaged brain tissue
The number of neutrophils appearing in the brain following ischemia directly corresponds to the size of the brain injury
Also, T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells infiltrate the brain after ischemia
In addition, mast cells intensify inflammatory responses by releasing tumor necrosis factor α, histamine, heparin, and proteases, i.e., tryptase, chymase, and matrix metalloproteinases, which cause secondary changes in the blood-brain barrier, edema of the brain, and penetration of neutrophils into the ischemic brain tissue
Lesions in white matter with the proliferation of neuroglial cells were documented in human and animal brains, after ischemia
An episode of cerebral ischemia in animals causes massive damage to the subcortical white matter and corpus callosum
Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, after ischemia, allows the movement of inflammatory cells and amyloid from the circulatory system to the brain, which additionally leads to the progression of changes in white matter
Data suggest that brain ischemia triggers massive neuronal death, especially in brain structures sensitive to ischemia
These processes develop both in the early and later stages following ischemia
In the years following ischemia, ischemic neurodegenerative processes cause general brain atrophy
Brain autopsy after experimental ischemia, with survival up to 2 years, showed the hallmarks of brain hydrocephalus and dilatation of the subarachnoid space around the brain hemispheres
Hippocampal atrophy was also observed in humans and animals after ischemia

AMYLOID-RELATED GENES IN POST-ISCHEMIC NEURODEGENERATION
Following experimental brain ischemia, with survival up to 2 years after ischemia, amyloid staining was documented in intracellular and extracellular space
Accumulation of amyloid in the extra-cellular space ranged from small dots to diffuse and senile amyloid plaques
Amyloid plaques were noted in the hippocampus, thalamus, brain cortex, corpus callosum, and around the lateral ventricles.
The deposition of amyloid inside neurons and neuroglial cells underscores the possible importance of amyloid in the progress of ischemic brain neurodegeneration
These observations indicate that following experimental ischemia, amyloid generation may be responsible for additional neurodegenerative mechanisms, which could worsen the outcome after ischemia due to continuous neuronal loss
Some data indicate that after ischemic episode, amyloid was generated as a product of neuronal death
The amyloid is a neurotoxic substance that induces intracellular processes in post-ischemic neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, which further causes extra neurons and neuroglia injury and/or death following ischemia
After ischemia, both diffuse and senile amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and cortex were observed in the human brain
According to
Hippocampal and cortical neuronal cells were the most intensely stained cells in the post-ischemic human brains.
Additionally, evidence from clinical investigations showed that plasma amyloid was raised in cases with ischemic brain injury
The increase of amyloid in serum correlated negatively with the clinical outcome following an ischemic brain episode
Following focal brain ischemia, messenger RNA (mRNA) of the amyloid protein precursor increased from 150 to 200% after 7 days of survival
The amyloid protein precursor is cleaved via α-secretase along a non-amyloidogenic pathway.
Following experimental ischemic brain episode, the αsecretase mRNA was reduced
In the amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid protein precursor is cleaved via β-and γ-secretase to form amyloid
Available data suggest that ischemia activates mRNA of β-secretase
Presenilins mRNA, which are induced via brain ischemia
The above evidence helps us understand the progressive neuronal death after an episode of brain ischemia, accumulation of amyloid, and the slow progressive development of Alzheimer's disease type neurodegeneration
In studies on post-ischemic brain changes, elevated presenilin 1 mRNA in the CA3 area and dentate gyrus of hippocampal neurons was noted at 3 days
In another study, increased presenilin mRNAs were noted in the hippocampus, striatum, and the brain cortex following focal ischemia
Presenilin mRNAs showed a maximum increase in the hippocampus and cortex.
The cortex exhibited an increase of presenilin 1 and 2 mRNAs within 1-8 days after local ischemia with recirculation
The elevated level was greater on the contralateral side than on the side of focal ischemic brain injury.
This difference is most likely associated with the loss of brain neurons expressing presenilin mRNAs on the ischemic side
In the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, 2 days after ischemia, the expression of the amyloid protein precursor gene was below the control value (Table
Within 7-30 days after ischemia with reperfusion, the expression of the amyloid protein precursor gene was above the control value (Table
The expression of the β-secretase gene was above the control value, 2-7 days after ischemia in the CA1 region (Table
Thirty days after ischemia, the expression of β-secretase gene was below the control value (Table
In the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the expression of presenilin 1 and 2 genes increased within 2-7 days after ischemia (Table
In contrast, 30 days following ischemia, the expression of presenilin 1 and 2 genes was below the control value (Table
At 2, 7, and 30 days following ischemia, the expression of the amyloid protein precursor gene was found to be above the control value in the CA3 region (Table
In this area, the α-secretase gene expression was below the control value at 2, 7, and 30 days after ischemia (Table
The expression of the β-secretase gene was below the control value following ischemia in the CA3 area, in 2-7 days (Table
In contrast, 30 days after ischemia, the β-secretase gene expression was above the control value (Table
In the CA3 subfield, the expression of the presenilin 1 gene increased in 2-7 days following ischemia (Table
In 30 days after ischemia, the expression of the presenilin 1 gene was below the control value (Table
In contrast, the expression of the presenilin 2 gene was reduced 2-7 days after ischemia (Table
But 30 days after ischemia, the expression of the presenilin 2 gene was above the control value (Table
In the medial temporal cortex, the expression of the amyloid protein precursor gene was below the control value, 2 days after ischemia (Table
In the above area, in 7-30 days after ischemia, the expression of the amyloid protein precursor gene was above the control value (Table
The β-secretase gene expression was above the control value at 2 days after ischemia (Table
But in 7-30 days after ischemia, the expression of the β-secretase gene was reduced (Table
The expression of the presenilin 1 gene was lowered below the control value, while the presenilin 2 gene was above the control value 2 days after ischemia (Table
Seven days after ischemia, the expression of the presenilin 1 gene was reduced, while that of the presenilin 2 gene was increased (Table
Thirty days after ischemia, the expression of the presenilin 1 gene was above the control value, while that of the presenilin 2 gene was below the control value (Table
Data show that brain ischemia triggers neuronal death in the hippocampus and in the medial temporal cortex in conjunction with amyloid, defining a new process that regulates the survival of neurons and/or death after-ischemia

TAU PROTEIN IN POST-ISCHEMIC NEURODEGENERATION
Strong neuronal staining of tau protein was found following ischemia in the hippocampus and the brain cortex
Also, tau protein staining was documented in post-ischemic microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes
Evidence shows that after ischemia, the hyperphosphorylated tau protein dominates in neuronal cells and goes along with apoptosis
The above data point out that neuronal apoptosis following ischemia is connected with hyperphosphorylation of tau protein.
In addition, it is also evident that ischemic brain injury was engaged in paired helical filaments
Tau protein was detected in the plasma samples of humans after ischemic brain injury and it most probably indicated the progress of neuronal changes after ischemia

DYSREGULATION OF TAU PROTEIN GENE IN POST-ISCHEMIC NEURODEGENERATION
In the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the expression of the tau protein gene was found to be increased above the control value, 2 days after ischemia (Table
In contrast, at 7-30 days after brain ischemia, gene expression was found to be below the control value (Table
In the CA3 subfield, the expression of the tau protein gene was found to be below the control value, 2 days after ischemia (Table
But, within 7-30 days following ischemia, the expression of the tau protein gene was higher than the control value (Table
The data indicate that postischemic brain injury triggers neuronal damage and death in the hippocampus in a tau protein-dependent mechanism, defining a new process, which in the long run regulates neuronal survival and/or death following ischemia

DEMENTIA IN POST-ISCHEMIC NEURODEGENERATION
Many studies have documented the development of dementia in animals after ischemic brain injury with recirculation (De la
Locomotor hyperactivity was noted after experimental brain ischemia
A lengthening of ischemic episode causes a longer duration of motor hyperactivity, and this is positively correlated with an increased number of damaged and lost neurons, especially in the hippocampus and progressive inflammation in the brain
Additionally, post-ischemic brain damage causes loss of reference and working memory with the progress of a spatial memory deficit
The progress of cognitive deficit develops systematically along with the lengthening of post-ischemic time
After repeated experimental brain ischemia with recirculation, durable motor hyperactivity with cognitive deficits and reduced anxiety was presented
The development of dementia was related to general brain atrophy
In these cases learning and memory deficits in experimental post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration irreversibly progressed and persisted forever
The progressive development of dementia is a patients dangerous consequence of post-ischemic pathology
The occurrence of dementia after the first ischemic stroke and recurrent stroke is calculated roughly at 10 and 41%, respectively
Within a 25-year follow-up, the incidence of dementia has been calculated approximately at 48%
Worldwide, dementia after ischemic stroke occurs between 5 and 50% of cases, depending on diagnostic criteria, population demographics, and geographical location
In fact, it is certain that dementia in post-ischemia brain neurodegeneration has many risk factors in common with the development of dementia in sporadic cases of Alzheimer's disease
It is highly likely that post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration may precede the final development of Alzheimer's disease.

CONCLUSION
This review presents the phenotype and genotype of Alzheimer's disease in post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration, such as neuropathology, amyloid, dysfunctional tau protein, and their genes, which altogether play an important role in the development of full-blown dementia (Figure
It provides Alzheimer's disease-linked gene changes of the amyloid protein precursor, α-secretase, β-secretase, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and tau protein in experimental post-ischemic injury in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus and medial temporal cortex.
The evidence demonstrates that post-ischemic brain damage causes the death of neuronal cells in the hippocampus and temporal cortex in a manner that is dependent on the amyloid and dysfunctional tau protein.
The above changes are associated with the accumulation of the amyloid in brain cells and in the extracellular spaces, such as diffuse and senile amyloid plaques, and the massive loss of neuronal cells with general brain atrophy, especially in the hippocampus, which finally leads to full-blown dementia in Alzheimer's disease (Figure
It is likely that following ischemia, the development of amyloid plaques in the brain is caused by an increased amyloid generation, an intensified inflow from blood, and worsening of amyloid clearance from the brain tissue.
Based on the presented evidence, it can be concluded that post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration influences the processing of the amyloid protein precursor, at both the gene and protein level, and leads to the generation of amyloid plaques in brain parenchyma.
In addition, observations showed that ischemic injury of the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus influence the expression of the tau protein gene.
It can also be noted that dysregulated tau protein takes part in neuronal cell death in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus.
The existing data documented the development of neurofibrillary tangles following ischemia (Figure
In support of the above fact, elevated levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, which are involved in the development of neurofibrillary tangle-like tauopathy, were found after experimental ischemic brain injury
This may suggest the linking of dysfunctional tau protein with the onset of neuronal cell death in the hippocampus after ischemia.
The above evidence also indicates the regulation of the ischemic death of neuronal cells in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus in a manner dependent on the structure of the tau protein.
The parallelism between post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease at the molecular level (Figure
The conclusions drawn from this investigation of ischemia-triggered Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology, proteins, and their genes indicates that they contribute to the death of neuronal cells, the generation of the amyloid plaques, the development of neurofibrillary tangles, and finally, neurodegeneration with full-blown dementia (Figure
These findings may significantly contribute to finding new causal treatments of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease.
The dominant hypothesis of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, neuropathological guidelines for the diagnosis of the disease, and most of the wide-ranging therapeutic efforts, both in research and clinical practice, have been built around the amyloid and tau proteins as causal factors
However, the causal link between amyloid and the development of Alzheimer's disease remains unproven.
Currently, in the context of a comprehensive evaluation of the past and contemporary research, critical questions are being raised regarding the role of amyloid and tau protein in the diagnosis, etiology, and definition of Alzheimer's disease.
It is argued that a holistic review of the available data does not allow a clear conclusion for the fact that amyloid plays a central or unique role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
A new analysis of data proposes that deposits of amyloid and dysfunctional tau protein may not be the primary cause in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease; further research is needed in this field
Regarding the two potentially dangerous substances blamed for the green light in Alzheimer's disease, recent data show that amyloid and tau protein pathology should be triggered by some factors and then interact with each other, exerting a synergistic deleterious effect on the neural network, which is believed to initiate the progression of Alzheimer's disease
It is certain that alterations of amyloid and tau protein are currently ruled out as the sole cause of dementia, as it does not explain why about half of the world's population over the age of 45 have amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles without dementia
The presence of amyloid plaques, which do not cause any disturbance, has been found in older adults who identify themselves with excellent cognitive functions
In these subjects, the average neurofibrillary tangle concentration was observed to increase exponentially with age
To sum up, there are no older adults who do not exhibit the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in their brains
Additionally, the appearance of the hippocampal atrophy in cognitively normal elderly may not be dependent on amyloidosis
On the other hand, a multicenter study reported that patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease were found to be negative for brain amyloid; for example, amyloid was noted to be absent in 32% of cases studied
After analyzing past and contemporary studies about on the amyloid theory of Alzheimer's disease by
(1) Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles may be present in the brain without cognitive impairment.
(2) The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease does not include the structure of amyloid and tau protein in the brain.
(3) The number, size, and enlargement of amyloid plaques are not related to cognitive impairment.
(4) Soluble amyloid and amyloid plaques in the brain are not a warning sign of impending dementia.
Novel discoveries have demonstrated that amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles do not initiate Alzheimer's disease as these are only two among a multitude of degenerative changes that occur in this disease
Our review aims to challenge these shared views and suggests that continuing this approach may be counterproductive.
Instead, the data suggest that we should look for alternative views on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease that are currently potentially under consideration.
We propose that a thorough understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and the implementation of the final, effective treatment requires a new objective approach in this topic, beyond the current amyloid-centric approach, without excluding the role of amyloid.
The continued interest in the research on cerebral ischemia provides evidence that ischemia may be involved in the development of the genotype and phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that cerebral ischemia can be considered a useful model for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease.
In spite of reasonable doubts about the role of brain ischemia in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, the mounting evidence on the ischemic development of the disease should not be ignored.
Ignoring the huge number of experimental and clinical evidence on the connection between ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease will not only hamper proper understanding of the disease pathways, but also development strategies for diagnosis, management, and therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
Although significant progress has been made in the last few years, it is clear from a review of the available publications that much remains to be clarified regarding the relationship between cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease.
The fact that even the combined association of amyloid and tau protein pathology does not necessarily lead to Alzheimer's disease, in addition to the fact that other factors like ischemia might be playing a role in triggering or accelerating the Alzheimer's disease type cognitive decline, has prompted a handful of investigators to conclude that studies should aim to understand the interactions among these factors during the progression of injury following brain ischemia, and that the genetic, molecular, and cognitive profiles of patients must be analyzed on an individual basis
In conclusion, the behavior of Alzheimer's disease-related genes in the human brain after ischemia should be investigated in the near future as the lack of such data is a significant limitation in our presentation.
