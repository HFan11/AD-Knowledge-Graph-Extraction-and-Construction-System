Inhibition of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p ameliorates Alzheimer's disease by enhancing autophagy
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently ranked as the third leading cause of death for eldly people, just behind heart disease and cancer.
Autophagy is declined with aging.
Our study determined the biphasic changes of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p associated with AD progression in APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model and demonstrated inhibiting miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p treatment prevented AD progression by promoting the autophagic clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ).
Methods: The biphasic changes of microRNAs were obtained from RNA-seq data and verified by qRT-PCR in early-stage (6 months) and late-stage (12 months) APPswe/PS1dE9 mice (hereinafter referred to as AD mice).
The AD progression was determined by analyzing Aβ levels, neuron numbers (MAP2 + ) and activated microglia (CD68 + IBA1 + ) in brain tissues using immunohistological and immunofluorescent staining.
MRNA and protein levels of autophagic-associated genes (Becn1, Sqstm1, LC3b) were tested to determine the autophagic activity.
Morris water maze and object location test were employed to evaluate the memory and learning after antagomirs treatments in AD mice and the Aβ in the brain tissues were determined.
Results: MiR-331-3p and miR-9-5p are down-regulated in early-stage of AD mice, whereas up-regulated in late-stage of AD mice.
We demonstrated that miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p target autophagy receptors Sequestosome 1 (Sqstm1) and Optineurin (Optn), respectively.
Overexpression of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p in SH-SY5Y cell line impaired autophagic activity and promoted amyloid plaques formation.
Moreover, AD mice had enhanced Aβ clearance, improved cognition and mobility when treated with miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs at late-stage.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that using miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p, along with autophagic activity and amyloid plaques may distinguish early versus late stage of AD for more accurate and timely diagnosis.
Additionally, we further provide a possible new therapeutic strategy for AD patients by inhibiting miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p and enhancing autophagy.

Introduction
AD is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline
Dementia of patients ranges from the mildest stage to the most server stage, when the person depends completely on others for basic activities of daily living.
Research indicates that changes in the brain occur decades before cognitive problems appear
However, it is not yet clear what causes these changes.
To know the underlying mechanism regulating the AD progression is the first step to achieve the goal of AD treatment, preventing progressive cognitive decline.
There remains no effective drug to cure AD
Thus, it is vital to develop effective diagnostic tools and new therapeutic strategies from mechanistic studies.
Extracellular Aβ deposition, intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles formation remain the primary neuropathologic criteria for AD diagnosis
The diagnosis and grading of AD are based on some memory and physical assessments evaluating persons who have been suffered from memory loss and cognitive decline
AD can be only definitely diagnosed after death, by linking clinical symptoms with an post-mortem examination of Aβ deposition in brain tissue
To diagnose people with mild cognitive impairment who may be at great risk for AD remains a challenge due to lack of measurements at early stage.
Thus, exploring biomarkers at early stage of AD process is imperative
Biomarkers such as microRNAs were demonstrated to play a critical role in AD process
Studying the role of microRNAs in AD process was of great significance for preventing AD progression.
Aβ was accumulated in the brain of AD patients.
Neutralization of Aβ by aducanumab showed a promising perspective for the clinical treatment of AD
Autophagy was partially responsible for eliminating the Aβ aggregates and neuronal tau
The dysfunction of autophagy led to Aβ and tau accumulation and promoted progression of AD
However, the regulation of selective autophagy by microRNAs in AD progress remains unknown.
By sequencing the RNAs in nine-month AD and WT mice, two independent groups found that microRNA profile changed during AD process and miR-331-3p was increased in AD mice
Examining the altered miRNAs at age 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months by qRT-PCR,
MiR-9 expression was noted to be downregulated in mice primary hippocampal neurons treated with Aβ
However, the underlying mechanism is unrevealed that why microRNAs are expressed dynamically and how microRNAs affect AD process.
In this study, we demonstrated the biphasic changes of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p expression during AD process, which have lower levels at the early-stage and higher levels at the late-stage of AD mice as compared with wild-type (WT) mice.
Besides, miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p targeted autophagy receptors Sqstm1 and Optn respectively and affected the selective autophagy pathway during AD process.
Our results suggested that autophagy was upregulated in the very beginning of Aβ deposition, which could be defined as the early-stage of AD, and autophagy could be impaired in the late-stage of AD.
The autophagic activity was regulated by dynamically expressed microRNAs.
Upon inhibiting miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p, AD mice have improved learning and memory.

Results

Pathological changes during the AD progression
The early and late stages of AD patients and AD mice remain ambiguous in the previous study.
For a better description of the presented data, here we designate AD mice ≤ 6-month-old as an early stage of AD mouse model (early-stage of AD), and AD mice ≥ 12-month-old as a late stage of AD mouse model (late-stage of AD).
To evaluate the pathology during AD process, Aβ deposition was determined by immunofluorescent staining and showed marginal change in the early-stage, and increased significantly in the late-stage of AD mice as compared with WT mice (Figure
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed Aβ deposited most in hippocampus of AD mice (Figure
Immunofluorescent staining of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1, a microglia marker
Double immunofluorescent staining revealed higher Aβ accumulation was associated with less neurons and more microglia (Figure

Biphasic changes of autophagic activity, miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p in AD process
To determine autophagic activity in AD process, we analyzed the autophagy-associated gene expression in AD mice.
Beclin1 (Becn1) and Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3b) mRNA levels, protein level of BECN1 and the ratio of LC3B-II:I were increased at early-stage of AD but decreased at late-stage of AD mice as compared with WT (Figure
On the contrary, AD mice had higher Aβ accumulation at late-stage as determined by western blot (Figure
These results suggested enhanced autophagic activity in the early-stage but impaired autophagic activity in the late-stage of AD.
To identify miRNA candidates regulating autophagic activity in AD process, miRNA expression profile from the RNA-seq data was analyzed
AD mice at 9 months have higher miR-331-3p than WT in two studies
MiR-9 is another candidate reported to elevate in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of AD patients
The qRT-PCR results from different tissues revealed that miR-331-3p in brain and spleen tissues and miR-9-5p in brain tissue were significantly decreased in early-stage of AD, while both miRNAs in brain tissues manifested higher expression levels in late-stage of AD as compared with WT mice (Figure
MiR-331-3p and miR-9-5p expression levels in liver, lung, and kidneys were comparable between AD and WT mice (Figure
Targetscan predicted that autophagy receptors Sqstm1 and Optn were potential targets for miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p respectively (Figure
AD mice showed higher mRNA and protein levels of SQSTM1 and OPTN at early-stage, and lower mRNA and protein levels of SQSTM1 and OPTN at late-stage of AD mice as compared with WT (Figure
SQSTM1 and OPTN expression levels were negatively correlated with the miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p expression levels suggested that miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p might play a critical role in AD process by regulating SQSTM1 and OPTN.

Aβ accumulation was regulated by miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p via targeting Sqstm1 and Optn
We further scrutinized whether the Aβ deposition was regulated by miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p during the AD process.
Luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine whether autophagy receptors Sqstm1 and Optn were the targets of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p respectively.
Fusion expression of 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Sqstm1 or Optn behind the luciferase reporter gene referred as Sqstm1-WT, Optn-WT; mutated seed sequences of the targeted regions referred as Sqstm1-MU, Optn-MU (Figure
Upon treatment with miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p mimic, luciferase activity in Sqstm1-WT or Optn-WT was significantly impaired respectively, but marginally changed in Sqstm1-MU or Optn-MU group (Figure
SQSTM1 or OPTN protein levels were decreased when 293T cells were treated with miR-331-3p mimic or miR-9-5p mimic respectively as determined by western blot (Figure
Thus, the results indicated that Sqstm1 might be the target for miR-331-3p and Optn might be the target for miR-9-5p.
To determine whether amyloid plaques was regulated by miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p, SH-SY5Y cells, an in vitro cell model for studying function of neuron in AD condition
Protein levels of SQSTM1, OPTN, BECN1, and LC3B-II:I ratio were reduced when treated with mimic of miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p, and increased with inhibitor of miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p treatment in SH-S5Y5 cells (Figure
Sqstm1 and Optn mRNA levels were decreased upon mimic of miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p treatment and increased upon inhibitor of miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p treatment in SH-S5Y5 cells (Figure
Immunofluorescent staining and western blot further revealed higher Aβ accumulation levels in undifferentiated SH-S5Y5 cells with miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p treatment, and lower Aβ accumulation levels when inhibit miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p (Figure
Furthermore, SH-SY5Y cells were induced to neuronal differentiation with 10 μM retinoid acid (RA) treatment for 7 days
Consistent with results from undifferentiated SH-S5Y5 cells, RA induced SH-S5Y5 cells showed higher Aβ accumulation levels upon miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p treatment, and lower Aβ accumulation levels when inhibit miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p (Figure
These results indicated that the elimination of Aβ was regulated by miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p via targeting autophagy receptors Sqstm1 and Optn.

MiR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs ameliorated the cognitive decline and aberrant mobility of AD mice at late-stage
In vitro, miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p lead to accumulation of Aβ, we further tested whether inhibiting miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p can ameliorate memory loss and cognitive decline in vivo.
Mice injected with miR-331-3p antagomir or miR-9-5p antagomir, along with the negative control groups were subject to a range of behavioural experiments, which included the object location test (OLT) to determine the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning
To determine the specific brain regions involved in memory decline of AD mice, the OLT which were hippocampus-dependent, were performed.
Mice prefer novelty, and they will spend more time investigating the novel object.
Mice with hippocampal lesions have impaired spatial contextual learning and consequently demonstrate no preference for novel object
After three times of habituation, mice were first tested in a sample stage to explore two identical objects, followed by a test stage substituting one of the familiar objects to a novel location to assess their learning ability (Figure
The groups that received one of the antagomirs, or control group spent an almost equal time exploring the objects in the sample stage (Figure
In object location test, WT or AD mice treated with miR-331-3p antagomir or miR-9-5p antagomir or both together manifested higher discrimination index than control mice (Figure
In the first three days of visual platform training of MWM test, when 12-month-old AD mice were treated with miR-331-3p, miR-9-5p, or both together, the arrival time to the platform reduced compared with littermate controls (Figure
Moreover, in the spatial test with invisible platform, AD mice treated with the combination of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p together showed shorter escape latency than those treated with these two antagomirs respectively (Figure
In the part of the target quadrant occupancy, the group that received two antagomirs treatment spent more time in the target quadrant (Figure
These observations supported miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs could work synergistically to improve memory loss and cognitive decline in AD mice.
In the balance beam test, the AD mice treated with miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs together also showed shorter time to cross the beam than those treated with miR-331-3p antagomir alone or miR-9-5p antagomir alone, or control group (Figure
In footprint test, AD mice treated with miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs manifested accelerated speed, longer stride length, shorter base width than those treated with these two antagomirs respectively, or the control mice (Figure
These results suggested that miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs might ameliorate the memory loss and mobility decline in AD mice.

Aβ elimination was enhanced by miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p antagomirs treatment via activating autophagy
Furthermore, we scrutinized whether these cognition and mobility improvements of AD mice after miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p antagomir treatment was due to enhanced autophagic activity.
The accumulation of Aβ in AD mice treated with miR-331-3p antagomir, or miR-9-5p antagomir, or both together were significantly lower than that in the untreated group (Figure
Compared with the control group, AD mice treated with miR-331-3p antagomir, or miR-9-5p antagomir, or both together showed more neurons, lower number of activated microglia marked by IBA1 and CD68, associated with lower level of Aβ accumulation (Figure
Moreover, mRNA expression levels of Sqstm1, Optn, LC3b, and Becn1 were higher, protein level of Aβ was lower, protein level of BECN1, SQSTM1, OPTN, ratio of LC3B-II:I were higher in brain tissues of AD mice treated with miR-331-3p antagomir or miR-9-5p antagomir, or both together than that in control AD mice (Figure
These data implied that miR-331-3p antagomir and miR-9-5p antagomir might activate autophagy and promote Aβ elimination by targeting autophagy receptors in AD mice (Figure

Discussion
Preventing AD progression remains a challenge.
Understanding the molecular regulation during AD process is imperative for developing new regime for AD.
Herein, our findings demonstrated that biphasic expression of microRNAs during AD process, regulating autophagic activity dynamically.
MiR-331-3p and miR-9-5p were downregulated in brain tissues of AD mice at early-stage and upregulated at late-stage, regulating autophagy receptors Sqstm1 and Optn respectively.
Targeting miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p could ameliorate the memory loss and mobility decline of AD mice.
Assessments of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p expression levels, along with Aβ accumulation, and autophagic activity may distinguish the early versus late stages of AD progression.
Studies have been reported that microRNAs play a vital role in AD progression.
Application of microRNAs used as biomarkers for AD diagnosis was attracted intensive attention
Biomarker candidates have not been selected due to the high variability between reported data
Inconsistencies among studies could be due to several issues including the preparation of samples (samples from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue), selection of participants (AD patients at different stages)
Furthermore, cautions should be taken while using microRNAs as a biomarker of AD, since microRNAs may express dynamically during AD progression
Here, we found that miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p were decreased in the early-stage and increased in late-stage of AD mice.
Downregulation of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p, associated with higher autophagic activity, no significant accumulation of Aβ were observed in early-stage of AD mice, while upregulation of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p, associated with lower autophagic activity, significant accumulation of Aβ were observed in late-stage of AD mice, suggesting miR-331-3p and may serve as new biomarkers to distinguish early versus late stages of AD.
Curing AD is the next step after diagnosis.
Although donepezil and rivastigmine both contribute to preventing cognition decline in clinical therapy, but still no effective drug curing for AD
Autophagy played a significant role in AD pathology
Dysfunction of autophagy led to Aβ accumulation
But whether interfering autophagy could benefit AD patients remains unclear.
In this study, we found miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p targeting autophagy receptors Sqstm1 and Optn respectively.
Inhibiting miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p could improve the cognition and mobility of AD mice.
We noticed that AD mice treated with both antagomirs were better than the WT mice in MWM test and OLT.
These results may be attribute to antagomirs treatment mice had higher SQSTM1 and OPTN expression levels in brain tissues than WT mice (Figure
After all, all the results suggested improvement of cognition and mobility of AD mice when treated with miR-331-3p or miR-9-5p antagomir.
Studies reported previously that activating autophagy could benefit the brain microenvironment supporting the neuronal cell survival
Activated microglia is reported to be elevated in AD patients
In addition, MiR-9 has been reported to promote microglial activation and neuronal cell death by targeting MCPIP1
Consistent with previous studies, AD mice at late-stage had higher miR-9 expression level, increased activated microglia and lower number of neuronal cells in our study.
It did not conflict with our finding that miR-9 targeted OPTN and downregulated the autophagic activity.
It may be two aspects of miR-9's function.
MiR-9 expression level elevates in AD mice at late-stage, activates microglia and leads to neuronal cell death, on the other hand, miR-9 downregulated the autophagic activity by targeting OPTN, destroyed the clearance of Aβ aggregates via autophagy pathway and promote the progression of AD.
The underlying mechanism between the miR-9 regulated autophagy pathway associated with microglia activation and neuronal cell death needs more investigations.

The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (advansta, R-03726-E10) and imaged by the ChemiDoc XRS Plus luminescent image analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescent staining
After antagomir treatment and behavioral experiments, mice were sacrificed for histochemical and immunofluorescence examinations as previously described
Briefly, animals were deeply anesthetized with 120 μL 0.5% chloral hydrate.
After heart perfusion with 30 mL saline, followed by 40 mL 4% paraformaldehyde.
Brains were quickly removed and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4-6 h, subsequently cryoprotected in 35% sucrose separately.
For Immunohistochemical staining, samples dehydrated by graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin and sliced into 4-μm-thick sections.
Aβ accumulation was assayed with anti-Aβ antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-28365; 1:1000).
The staining score was calculated using the staining intensity times the cell percentage (-) % × 0 + (+) % × 1 + (++) % × 2 + (+++) % × 3. -indicates negative; + indicates weak staining signal; ++, medium staining signal; +++, strong staining signal.
For frozen section examination, samples embedded in optimal cutting (OCT) compound and quick-freeze in liquid nitrogen.
After sectioned at 5.0 μm with a Cryostat Microtome, sections incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-Aβ antibody (Abcam, ab2539; 1:200).
After rinsed in PBS for three times (5 min/time), the sections were applied with secondary antibodies goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Cy3) (Abcam; 1:200) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three rinses (5 min/time) in 100mM PBS, after mounting with Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (VECTOR, H-1200), pictures were obtained with the ApoTome.2
Imaging System (ZEISS, Germany).
Immunofluorescence assay of MAP2 (Proteintech, 17490-1-AP), IBA1 (Abcam, ab178847), CD68 (Abcam, ab31630) in the brain tissues of WT and AD mice also followed the above steps.

Morris water maze test
A spatial memory test was performed as previously described with minor modifications
The Morris water maze (MWM) is a white circular pool (diameter: 120 cm and height: 50 cm) with a featureless inner surface (XR-XM101, Shanghai Xinruan Information Technology Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China).
The circular pool was filled with nontoxic water and kept at 21-23 °C.
The pool was divided into four quadrants of equal area.
A transparent wooden platform (8 cm in diameter and 20 cm in height) was centered in one of the four quadrants of the pool.
There are four prominent visual cues on each side of the four quadrants of the pool.
Four habituation training was performed on day 3.
The water in the pool was un-dyed, and the platform was visible (1.5 cm above the water surface).
Test trials were conducted for seven days (day 4-day 10).
The water was white-dyed with non-toxic agents (food-grade titanium dioxide), and the platform was submerged 1.0 cm below the water surface so that it was invisible at the water level.
For each daily trial, the mouse was placed into the water maze at one of four randomly determined locations and released allowing the animal to find the hidden platform.
After the mouse found and climbed onto the platform, the trial was stopped, and the escape latency was recorded.
In order to assess the spatial retention of the location of the hidden platform, a probe trial was conducted 24 h after the last acquisition session.
During this trial, the platform was removed from the maze, and each mouse was allowed to search the pool for 60 s before being removed.
The time spent in the target quadrant was used as a measure of consolidated spatial memory.

Balance Beam Test
The ability of the mice to keep balance was evaluated in the balance beam test.
Balance beam test was performed as previously described
Mice were placed on the same starting point of a horizontal wooden bar (0.9 × 0.9 × 50 cm) 40 cm above the ground and a dark goal box on destination to attract the mouse to run up to this dark and safe environment.
The time taken to cross the beam was measured.
Mice were given a session and recorded three times per day with a 15-20 min interval and repeated for five successive days.

Footprint Test
The footprint test was used to describe the mice's gait and performed as previously described
The mouse's paws were marked with non-toxic waterproof paint to (red color was employed for forepaws and black for hind paws).
Mice were placed on the same starting point of a straight narrow tunnel (10 cm × 10 cm × 70 cm) with a piece of white paper on the bottom to record the footprints.
These measurements above were recorded.
The parameters included front base width, hind base width, forelimb stride length, hindlimb stride length, the overlap between hindlimb and forelimb and the speed to cross the tunnel.

The object location test
The object location test (OLT) was performed as previously described
The test equipment consists of a square box made of polymethyl methacrylate (40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) with external cues (different colour papers in the 4 side walls) to help mice to resolve this spatial memory task.
These cues were kept in a constant location throughout the period of testing.
Two identical black cylinders (5 cm in diameter, 10 cm tall) are placed at two corners of the device 6 cm from the side wall.
Mice release from release corner.
During habituation, the mice were allowed to freely explore the instrument for 2 min without objects, once a day for 3 consecutive days.
In the Sample Test (T1), two identical subjects were placed, and the mice were allowed to freely explore for 2 min.
Then, one object moved to a new location (NL), while the other object remained in familiar location (FL).
The Selection Test (T2) was subsequently performed, mice were allowed to explore for 2 min, the exploring time to FL or NL were recorded.
Exploration was defined as the mice directed the nose toward the object at a distance of no more than 2 cm.
Turning around or sitting on the object was not considered as exploratory behaviour.
The times spent by mice in exploring each object during T1 and T2 were recorded.
T1: the total exploring time in T1; T2: the total exploring time in T2; % Investigation time of novel location: NL/(NL + FL); Discrimination index: (NL -FL)/(NL + FL).
analysis Data were analyzed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software).
Results were presented as mean ± sd.
The statistical significance between various groups or treatments was measured by Student's t test or one-way ANOVA with Dunettee's post hoc test.
In all experiments, P-value ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, *** P ≤ 0.001, ** P ≤ 0.01, * P ≤ 0.05, without asterisks means no significance p>0.05.
