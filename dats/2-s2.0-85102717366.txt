Azeliragon ameliorates Alzheimer's disease via the Janus tyrosine kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway

' INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD), largely considered to be caused by aberrant amyloid b (Ab) accumulation and the most common cause of dementia, is clinically characterized by a progressive and irreversible loss of cognitive functions and is pathologically characterized by the loss of synapses and neuronal death
Ab is known to bind to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), an immunoglobulin supergene family member expressed on multiple cell types in the brain and periphery, which leads to sustained inflammatory states that play a crucial role in AD
Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development and progression of AD.
The inflammatory process in AD is driven by activated microglia and astrocytes, which induce pro-inflammatory response factors and related signaling pathways, resulting in synapse and neuron injury and further activation of inflammatory cells
The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), was the first member of the NLR family that is considered a critical component of the inflammasome and appears to be expressed ubiquitously
Recently, it has been reported that cerebellar granule neurons in rats subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation could increase the NLRP1 mRNA levels and aggravate ischemic injury
Ab and other abnormally aggregated proteins can induce the NLRP1-mediated activation of interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and IL-18, which promote the maturation and secretion of inflammatory factors to participate in the inflammatory response and represent a new mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD, which is ''pyroptosis''
The Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is involved in the inflammatory effect of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a vital role in the inflammation in AD and serves as an anti-inflammatory target in studies
The activation of NLRPs and subsequent IL-1b production by neutrophils could be blocked by tofacitinib, which interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
These studies indicated that the NLRP inflammasome may be related to the JAK/ STAT signaling pathway.
TTP488 (synonyms: Azeliragon), which was discovered by TransTech Pharma, Inc., serves as an active, centrally acting antagonist of the RAGE-RAGE ligand interaction and has been gradually applied in clinics
Chronic administration of TTP488 in AD transgenic mice has been reported to reduce the amyloid load in the brain, ameliorate behavioral damage, and normalize electrophysiological recordings
However, the mechanism whereby TTP488 ameliorates AD injury has not yet been fully clarified.
In this study, we focused on the TTP488-mediated alleviation of AD injury, which occurs via the inhibition of NLRP1 inflammasome activation, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and an NLRP1 overexpression lentivirus (oeNLRP1) to suppress the effects of TTP488.
Furthermore, we used tofacitinib and fludarabine to inhibit the progress of NLRP1 inflammasome activation.
Our findings indicate that TTP488 possibly reverses AD by affecting NLRP1 inflammasome activation via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
These results may provide a new strategy for AD development by inflammation and pyroptosis.

' MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Eight-to twelve-week-old healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, supplied by Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
(Shenyang, Liaoning, China), were housed in a temperature-and light-controlled environment under pathogen-free conditions and provided unlimited access to food and water (12/12h light/dark cycle, 60±5% humidity, and at 22 ± 3 o C)
All animals used in this experiment were cared for according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).

Ab preparation
The dried synthetic Ab1-42 peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was first dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in PBS to obtain a 250 mM stock solution.
This solution was incubated at 4 o C for at least 24h and stored at -80 o C until use
Before use, the solution was centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as an oligomeric Ab sample.
The reverse sequence peptide for Ab1-42 prepared in the same way was used as a control.

Rat model of AD
Rats were anesthetized by the intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (1 mL/100 g) and fixed in the stereotactic head frame after conventional skin preparation
The median line of the skull and anterior fontanelle was exposed.
A burr hole was bored in the right and left lateral cerebral ventricles (anterior-posterior axis, 1.0 mm; mediolateral axis, 2.0 mm).
A 10-mL microinjection pump was stereotactically inserted until a depth of 3.5 mm.
Next, 5 mL of Ab1-42 was injected into both sides.
The rats in the sham group were administered 5 mL of Ab42-1, as previously described

The animals were administered with Ab1-42 after 15 days
Intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.1 mg/kg) was used to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and exacerbate AD
Tofacitinib (20 mg/kg)

Morris water maze (MWM) assay
The MWM assay was conducted during the last 6 days of the treatment period.
It was performed in a circular pool (diameter, 120 cm) filled with opaque water at a temperature of 22±1 o C. The rats were allowed to search for the platform for 60s.
If a rat failed to find the platform, it was then picked up and placed on the platform for 15s, as previously described
The behaviors of all rats' were monitored using a video camera and analyzed using a computer-controlled system (Beijing Sunny Instruments Inc., Beijing, China).

Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of protein samples (40 mg) from each brain sample were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
All data were obtained using the ChemiDoc TM Touch Imaging System and analyzed with the Image Lab 3.0 software (Bio-Rad, California, USA).

Immunofluorescence staining
Expression levels of NLRP1 and NeuN were detected by IF staining.
A paraffin-embedded tissue section (5 mm thickness) was dewaxed using xylene and dehydrated using graded concentrations of alcohol and incubated with 3% H 2 O 2 for inhibiting endogenous peroxidase activity
After blocking in 10% goat serum for 10 min at room temperature, the section was incubated with the primary antibodies in a blocking solution overnight at 4 o C
Then, the slides were washed in PBS, followed by treatment with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Beyotime, China) for 30 min at 37 o C and washing with PBS.
Images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ni inverted microscope (TE2000, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

' RESULTS

AD was associated with NLRP1 inflammasome activation
The relationship between NLRP1 inflammasome activation and AD is shown in Figure
The NLRP1 expression in the Ab1-42 group increased significantly (po0.05)
compared to that in the sham group.
Moreover, in the Ab1-42+LPS group, the NLRP1 expression was further increased compared to that in the Ab1-42 group.
Nevertheless, the NeuN expression did not change significantly (Figure
The variation in the NLRP1/NeuN ratio was similar to that in the NLRP1 expression (Figure
Immunofluorescence staining of NLRP1/NeuN is shown in Figure
The number of NLRP1/NeuN-positive cells in the Ab1-42 group increased significantly compared to that in case of the sham group.
Similarly, in the Ab1-42+LPS group, the number of NLRP1/ NeuN-positive cells increased further, compared to that in case of the Ab1-42 group (Figure

TTP488 can reverse AD injury in vivo
TTP488 is a RAGE antagonist with anti-inflammatory properties.
In order to investigate the effect of TTP488 on AD, we designed three concentrations of TTP488 and verified their effects in vivo (Figure
The MWM results are shown in Figure
The latency time was significantly extended in the Ab1-42+vehicle group after 3 days, compared to that in the sham group.
Furthermore, there was no statistical significance between the latency times in the Ab1-42+vehicle and Ab1-42+TTP488 groups (Figure
The time and length in the platform quadrant were increased in the Ab1-42+20 mg/d and 50 mg/d TTP488 groups, compared to those in the Ab1-42+vehicle group (Figure
Moreover, there was no difference between the effects of TTP488 at 20 mg/d and 50 mg/d; therefore, we used 20 mg/d as the optimum concentration of TTP488 for intervention in the follow-up experiments.
The results of the immunofluorescence staining analysis for detecting NLRP1/NeuN is shown in Figure
However, in the Ab1-42+20 mg/d TTP488 group, the number of NLRP1/NeuNpositive cells decreased (Figure
The results of the Nissl staining are shown in Figure
In contrast, administering TTP488 ameliorated the neurocyte injury and increased the number of Nissl bodies (Figure

TTP488 reverses AD injury by affecting NLRP1 inflammasome activation
As TTP488 could reverse AD injury, we explored whether this process occurred via NLRP1 inflammasome activation.
We utilized LPS to activate the NLRP1 inflammasome (Figure
The MWM assay results are shown in Figure
Furthermore, the latency time after LPS-induced NLRP1 inflammasome activation was clearly shortened by administering TTP488 (Figure
The time spent and length covered in the platform quadrant varied inversely with the latency time (Figure
To investigate the effects of TTP488 on apoptosis after NLRP1 inflammasome activation, we used TUNEL staining to observe the changes (Figure
The apoptosis level in the Ab1-42+LPS group was increased compared with that in the Ab1-42 group.
The number of TUNEL-positive cells was also markedly reduced after TTP488 administration (Figure
To further investigate the role of the NLRP1 inflammasome, we used the oeNLRP1 construct to induce the NLRP1 expression.
The latency time was significantly extended in the Ab1-42+oeNLRP1 group after 3 days, compared to that for the Ab1-42 group.
Furthermore, the latency time after oeNLRP1 administration was evidently shortened by administering TTP488 (Figure
The time spent and the length covered in the platform quadrant varied inversely with the latency time (Figure
Likewise, the apoptosis level in the Ab1-42+oeNLRP1 group was higher than that in the Ab1-42 group.
The number of TUNEL-positive cells also reduced markedly after TTP488 administration (Figure

TTP488 can reverse inflammation by affecting NLRP1 inflammasome activation in AD
As TTP488 could reverse AD injury by affecting NLRP1 inflammasome activation, we detected the inflammation level following TTP488 administration by western blotting and ELISA assays (Figure
In our experiments, we used LPS and the oeNLRP1 construct to activate NLRP1.
As shown in Figure
The activities of caspase-1, IL-1b, and IL-18 were detected by ELISA; they increased following LPS treatment and decreased following TTP488 administration, similar to the case for their protein levels (Figure
As shown in Figure
The activities of caspase-1, IL-1b, and IL-18 were uniformly increased by oeNLRP1 and decreased by TTP488 (Figure
The TTP488-mediated alleviation of AD, which occurred via NLRP1, was regulated through the JAK/STAT signal pathway
To eliminate the influence of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway involved in the TTP488-mediated recovery of AD injury, which occurred via NLRP1 inflammasome activation, we used tofacitinib and fludarabine, which are specific inhibitors of JAK and STAT, respectively (Figure
As shown in Figure
The time spent and the length covered in the platform quadrant varied inversely with the latency time (Figure
Furthermore, the protein levels (Figure

' DISCUSSION
AD is a progressive disease mainly manifesting as progressive memory defects, gradual decline in language, spatial recognition, cognitive ability, independent living ability, and abnormal mental behavior; it seriously affects the physical health and quality of life of the elderly
Ab could lead to sustained inflammatory states that play a crucial role in AD
In human AD patients, the levels of neuroinflammation markers, such as INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and nitric oxide, were higher in mild and severe stages than in the earlier phases, indicating the progression of the disease
Neuroinflammation has been a target of drug therapy for AD treatment
Inflammasomes are intracellular polymeric protein complexes composed of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin (NLRP), caspase-1, and apoptotic granular proteins with the CARD domain
Studies have reported that NLRP1 inflammation corpuscles induce inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, while the suppression of their activity alleviates intrinsic immune responses, neuronal death, and age-related cognitive impairment
More importantly, another study based on candidate genes found a link between the NLRP1 gene polymorphism and AD patients
In our study, we used LPS, an inflammatory agonist of AD, to activate the NLRP1 inflammasome, and the expression of NLRP1 was found to be significantly increased following LPS treatment in the western blotting and immunofluorescence staining assays.
These results highlight that LPS induces AD via NLRP1 inflammasome activation.
TTP488 has been reported to serve as an antagonist of the RAGE-RAGE ligand interaction through various clinical trials and is applied for AD therapy
Therefore, we screened the optimum concentration of TTP488 and evaluated the spatial memory, levels of inflammatory markers, and nerve cells in rats with AD.
The results showed that TTP488 significantly improved the spatial memory of rats, reduced the NLRP1 levels, and decreased the neuronal cell damage.
Furthermore, to detect the inhibition of NLRP1 inflammasome activation in TTP488, we used LPS and the oeNLRP1 construct, which reversed the effects of TTP488 in our study.
Thus, these findings show that the anti-inflammatory function of TTP488 may be achieved via the inhibition of NLRP1 inflammasome activation.
Pyroptosis is characterized by cellular lysis and the release of cytosolic contents into the extracellular space; this is associated with NLRP1 inflammasome activation, leading to the generation of a functional caspase-1-containing inflammasome.
Thus, pyroptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of AD
To verify the anti-inflammatory function of TTP488, we also detected the levels of caspase-1, IL-1b, and IL-18, which are pyroptosis factors.
The results showed that TTP488 markedly decreased the expression and activities of caspase-1, IL-1b, and IL-1 by inhibiting NLRP1 inflammasome activation.
NLRP activation and subsequent IL-1b production by neutrophils could be blocked by tofacitinib, which interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathways
However, whether the anti-inflammatory function of TTP488 occurs via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has not yet been reported.
To address this issue, we used tofacitinib and fludarabine, which block JAK and STAT, respectively, after NLRP1 inflammasome activation in AD in rats.
Our results showed that tofacitinib and fludarabine further improved the spatial memory and reduced the inflammatory levels of pyroptosis after NLRP1 inflammasome activation.
Our findings indicated that TTP488 significantly inhibited NLRP1 expression and activation during AD in rats by modulating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and then improved the spatial memory and reduced the inflammatory levels of pyroptosis.
Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of a new potential mechanism underlying the TTP488-mediated alleviation of AD injury.
