Salidroside reduces neuropathology in Alzheimer’s disease models by targeting NRF2/SIRT3 pathway
Background: Neurite dystrophy is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, drug discovery targeting neurite protection in AD remains largely unexplored.
Methods: Aβ-induced neurite and mitochondrial damage assays were used to evaluate Aβ toxicity and the neuroprotective efficacy of a natural compound salidroside (SAL).
The 5×FAD transgenic mouse model of AD was used to study the neuroprotective function of SAL.
To verify the direct target of SAL, we used surface plasmon resonance and cellular thermal shift assays to analyze the drug-protein interaction.
Results: SAL ameliorates Aβ-mediated neurite damage in cell culture.
We further reveal that SAL represses mitochondrial damage in neurites by promoting mitophagy and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, dependent on an NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3.
In AD mice, SAL protects neurite morphology, mitigates Aβ pathology, and improves cognitive function, which are all SIRT3-dependent.
Notably, SAL directly binds to transcription factor NRF2, inhibits its degradation by blocking its interaction with KEAP1 ubiquitin ligase, and then advances NRF2-mediated SIRT3 transcription.
Conclusions: Overall, we demonstrate that SAL, a potential anti-aging drug candidate, attenuates AD pathology by targeting NRF2/SIRT3 pathway for mitochondrial and neurite protection.
Drug discovery strategies focusing on SAL may thus provide promising therapeutics for AD.

Background
The major neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in brain, firstly reported by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in his original case of the disease that would eventually bear his name
Abnormal neuronal processes surrounding Aβ plaques, known as dystrophic neurites (DNs), are now believed to be another critical hallmark of AD, specially at early stages
Interestingly, in the early twentieth century, the famous neuroscientist Ramón y Cajal already provided a hypothesis about the development of DNs in AD
Recent evidence has shown that DNs appear to surround and enter adjacent Aβ plaques, which may disrupt microtubes, impair axonal transport and lead to exacerbation of Aβ pathology
Aβ released from senile plaques, is toxic to nearby neurites including axons or dendrites or some combination of both.
The mechanisms of Aβ toxicity involve inflammation, membrane perforation, synaptic failure, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction
Among these mechanisms, much attention has been focused on mitochondria, as a central hub, regulating stress sensing, energy metabolism and neuronal death.
Notably, mitochondria are recently shown to be vital for modulating neurite retraction
In fact, targeting mitochondria has emerged as a promising approach for neuroprotection.
In the past decade, increasing drug candidates that target "in and out" the mitochondria have been investigated from preclinical stages to clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs)
Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of proteins that act as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) dependent deacetylases.
In mammals, seven SIRTs exist, including three members, SIRT3, 4, and 5, that localize exclusively within the mitochondria.
Mounting evidence has shown that SIRTs, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT2, target multiple substrates such as PGC-1α, NF-κB, FOXO1/3, and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and play a protective function against AD pathogenesis
In addition, mitochondrial SIRT3-5 may also function as anti-aging or neuronal/synaptic protective agents
In the recent few years, mitophagy, an autophagy pathway by removing damaged mitochondria, is proved to be compromised in AD, and promotion of mitophagy improves AD pathologies
In this respect, pharmacological rescue of impaired mitophagy is now considered to be beneficial for AD therapeutics
SIRT3 is known to regulate mitochondrial function including mitophagy in nervous system
It will be also interesting to determine the SIRT3 function on other aspects of mitochondrial biology, including mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
Salidroside (SAL) is a glucoside of tyrosol identified in the plant Rhodiola rosea.
As a natural bioactive compound, it has been studied as a potential neuroprotective molecule for the treatment of many neurological disorders including AD
In fact, SAL administration improves learning and memory in various animal models, but the underlying mechanisms are vague, possibly by modulation of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death
It is important to note that no direct targets of SAL have so far been revealed, which explains the uncategorized mechanism of action and hinders its clinical application.
In AD pathogenesis, neurite dystrophy is thought to be an earlier event before neuronal death.
SAL has shown protective efficacy on hippocampal neuronal death
Here, we report that SAL can prevent Aβ-induced neuritic toxicity in cell culture.
The protective function of SAL is mediated by SIRT3-dependent regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy.
In the 5×FAD mouse model of AD, SAL treatment protects neurite morphology, reduces Aβ pathology, and improves cognitive function, which are dependent on SIRT3 as well.
Strikingly, we find that SAL directly binds to a transcription factor NRF2 and inhibits its degradation by disrupting the formation of NRF2-KEAP1 protein complex, then upregulates NRF2-mediated SIRT3 transcription.
Thus, our findings reveal a novel function of SAL for neurite protection in AD by directly targeting NRF2/SIRT3 pathway, which may also represent a general mechanism of SAL protection in other NDs.

Results

SAL alleviates neurite and mitochondrial injury induced by toxic CCCP or Aβ42 oligomers
We hypothesized that SAL might protect neuronal processes (also known as neurites) against damage in AD pathogenesis.
To test this hypothesis, we first carried out experiments for neurite differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells using an established protocol (Fig.
Previous findings suggested that 50 μM SAL had no toxic effect and showed good protective efficacy in cultured cells
Our data also showed that 50 μM SAL had better efficacy than 5 μM SAL on neurite extension of SH-SY5Y cells without cell toxicity (Additional file 1: Fig.
We thus used 50 μM SAL for the next cell culture studies.
The brightfield images of neurite morphology indeed showed a protective action of SAL on neurite length under CCCP stimulation (Additional file 1: Fig.
Compared to CCCP, Aβ42 also induced a weaker neurite injury of SH-SY5Y cells shown by fragmented processes, which was also reduced by SAL pre-treatment, as indicated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of Tuj1 (a neuritic marker) (Fig.
Of note, in primary neuronal culture, SAL exerted a remarkable action in neurite protection upon Aβ stimulation, with 2.7-fold increase of the total length, compared to PBS control (Fig.
We further found that simultaneous incubation of SAL along with Aβ also inhibited Aβ-induced neurite damage by ~ 27.3% (Additional file 1: Fig.
Neurite injury is highly correlated to the impairment of mitochondria inside the processes.
To assess whether SAL prevents mitochondrial damage stimulated by CCCP or Aβ42, we used IF of TOM20 (a mitochondrial marker) to observe their morphology in SH-SY5Y cells.
As expected, mitochondria were shortened and fragmented by CCCP stimulation.
Again, SAL repressed mitochondrial shortening by ~ 22.1% and their fragmentation by ~ 26.1% in soma (Additional file 1: Fig.
We further assessed the mitochondrial protection of SAL on neurites.
Like its protective action against CCCP in somata, SAL also remarkably inhibited mitochondrial truncation and fractionalization in neurites induced by Aβ42 (Fig.
These data suggest that SAL ameliorates CCCP or Aβ induced neurite and mitochondrial impairment.

SAL promotes neuronal mitophagy in both somata and neurites upon Aβ stimulation
Recent evidence refers that activation of mitophagy reverses Aβ pathology in AD mice
These findings lead us to test whether SAL elevates neuronal mitophagy.
We first generated a derivative of the SH-SY5Y stable cell line expressing Mito-mKeima, to measure the level of mitophagy.
The mKeima assays clearly showed a promotion of mitophagy around 2.8-fold in soma after SAL treatment (Fig.
This result was further confirmed by fluorescence images of LC3-GFP and MitoTracker colocalization (Additional file 1: Fig.
In addition, we extracted mitochondrial protein from SH-SY5Y cells and examined the markers of mitophagic pathway.
Immunoblotting showed that SAL indeed upregulated mitochondrial levels of PARKIN, PINK1 and LC3-II (Fig.
By using adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles to express MitoGFP, which specifically labels mitochondria (Additional file 1: Fig.
IF images of LC3 (red) and MitoGFP (green) co-localization showed that Aβ elevated mitophagy levels, indicated by increased yellow puncta, in somata.
Notably, SAL further raised the number of yellow puncta (MitoGFP/LC3 co-localization) by 1.4-fold, compared to Aβ alone, demonstrating the augmentation of mitophagy upon SAL treatment (Fig.
To evaluate the mitophagy levels in neurites, we further analyzed the LC3 and MitoGFP co-labeling and found that SAL treatment accelerated mitophagy by 1.5-fold, compared to stimulation with Aβ alone (Fig.
Our data imply that SAL promotes basal mitophagy levels and also exacerbates Aβ-induced mitophagy either in somata or in neurites.
Possibly, SAL-triggered elevation of mitophagy may act as a protective mechanism against neurite injury, likely by increasing the clearance of damaged mitochondria

SAL-activated mitophagy is dependent on SIRT3 expression
SIRT family proteins may regulate mitochondrial homeostasis including mitophagy
To elucidate the mechanism of neurite protection and mitophagy activation of SAL, we measured the expression levels of mitochondrial SIRT3-5 in SH-SY5Y cells with and without SAL treatment.
Interestingly, quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays indicated that SAL upregulated both SIRT3 and SIRT4, but not SIRT5 (Fig.
Given that SIRT3 is the most thoroughly studied mitochondrial SIRT and its higher expression induced by SAL, our next study mainly focuses on SIRT3.
Consistently, immunoblotting also showed a dose-dependent upregulation of SIRT3 protein levels upon SAL treatment, but with no change on the levels of APP and BACE1 (Fig.
Although we may not entirely exclude other possible targets of SAL involved in this process, our data strongly suggest that SIRT3 is a critical molecule responsible for SAL-mediated neurite protection.
To answer that whether SIRT3 is essential for SAL-activated mitophagy, we generated two SH-SY5Y cell lines, in which, one stably expressed shRNA against SIRT3 [SIRT3 knockdown (KD)] and another overexpressed SIRT3 (SIRT3 OE) (Additional file 1: Fig.
The data showed that the colocalization of LC3 and mitochondria was not increased after SAL treatment in SIRT3 KD cells, but upregulated in SIRT3 OE cells even without SAL treatment (Additional file 1: Fig.
Notably, not like in naïve cells, Aβ-induced mitophagy in SIRT3 KD cells was not further augmented by SAL either in somata, or in neurites (Fig.
To further confirm the SIRT3 function, we cultured primary neurons from Sirt3 floxp mice and transduced them with AAV particles encoding MitoGFP and a Cre recombinase to obtain SIRT3 knockout (KO) cells in which mitochondria were simultaneously labeled with GFP (Additional file 1: Fig.
IF images showed a similar effect of SAL in SIRT3 KO primary neurons as in SIRT3 KD cells (Fig.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that SIRT3 expression is indispensable for SAL-mediated activation of mitophagy.

SIRT3 is required for SAL-induced neurite and mitochondrial protection
To verify the possible function of SIRT3 on neurite protection, we used both naïve SH-SY5Y and SIRT3 KD cell line to differentiate neurites and then conducted Aβ-induced neurite injury assays.
Truly, SAL exhibited a powerful neurite protection in naïve SH-SY5Y cells when treated with Aβ.
In SIRT3 KD cells, Aβ triggered a more severer neurite damage, however the SAL protection was completely abolished (Fig.
Our data thus demonstrate the essentiality of SIRT3 for SAL-mediated neurite preservation.
Besides the activity of SIRT3 in mitophagy (Fig.
We thereby investigated the potential capacity of SIRT3 in the homeostasis regulation of mitochondria by analyzing their morphology, membrane potential, and ROS production.
Using IF of TOM20 (a mitochondrial marker), we detected the mitochondrial morphology in SIRT3 KD cells and found that mitochondrial segments in neurite were severely fragmented either by CCCP or Aβ treatment.
Clearly, in SIRT3 KD cells, SAL did not show any protection on Aβ-induced mitochondrial damage, indicating by no restored mitochondrial length and density (Fig.
The JC-1 assays also showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was impaired upon Aβ stimulation.
Similarly, SAL treatment largely reduced the Aβ-induced MMP dysfunction in naïve cells, but its protection was similarly diminished in SIRT3 KD cells (Fig.
We further measured the cellular ROS levels using a fluorescence probe DCFH.
In accordance, Aβ-induced ROS upregulation was inhibited by SAL, only in naïve cells, not in SIRT3 KD cells (Fig.
Thus, our findings refer that SIRT3 is also requisite for SAL-mediated maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis in neurite protection.

SIRT3 is essential for SAL-mediated cognitive restoration of AD mice
We next extended our study into a 5×FAD mouse model of AD and a workflow diagram was described to assess the SAL efficacy and SIRT3 function (Fig.
Morris water maze (MWM) test showed that 5×FAD had a clear deficiency of spatial memory in contrast to wild type (WT) mice.
Indeed, oral administration of SAL sharply improved the learning and memory (Fig.
We used an AAV injection approach for SIRT3 KD and successfully transduced the cells in the whole hippocampus (Additional file 1: Fig.
As expected, SIRT3 KD in WT did not change the mouse behavior (Additional file 1: Fig.
Strikingly, SIRT3 KD in hippocampi of 5×FAD, nearly completely abolished the protective efficacy of SAL (Fig.
Moreover, we used Y-maze test to measure spatial reference memory.
In accordance with the MWM test, it revealed that SAL strongly improved cognitive function in 5×FAD mice.
Again, SIRT3 KD blocked the protective effect of SAL (Fig.
Overall, these data imply that SAL can ameliorate cognitive decline in AD mice, which is dependent on SIRT3 expression.

SAL mediates a SIRT3-dependent reduction of Aβ pathology and neurite damage in AD mice
To elucidate whether SAL can mitigate Aβ pathology, a main cause for cognitive defect in 5×FAD, we examined the intensity of Aβ plaque, microgliosis and astrogliosis in hippocampi of 5×FAD mice.
In fact, SAL greatly reduced the area of Aβ plaque (Aβ + IHC) by 41.9%, microgliosis (Iba1 + IHC) by 49.3%, and astrogliosis (GFAP + IHC) by 31.4%, respectively.
We further analyzed the total number of Aβ plaques and the number of Aβ plaques with different sizes (diameter < 20 μm, 20-40 μm and > 40 μm).
Data showed a SAL-mediated reduction of Aβ load, especially on medium and larger size of Aβ plaques (Additional file 1: Fig.
Consistent with the behavioral tests, SIRT3 KD inhibited the SAL-mediated reduction of these pathological features (Fig.
Next, we aimed to test whether SAL could alleviate neurite damage in brains of 5×FAD mice, like it does in cell cultures.
Although knowing the difficulty of the technology, we tried to use IHC and detect the LAMP1 level as a marker for dystrophic neurites.
Data indeed showed that SAL reduced the levels of LAMP1 nearby Aβ plaques, while SIRT3KD partially inhibited the SAL function (Additional file 1: Fig.
Next, we used Golgi silver staining to observe and trace neurite morphology of CA1 pyramidal neurons.
The drawings in Fig.
Likewise, SIRT3 KD minimized the SAL potency on neurite protection (Fig.
The sholl analysis, as established previously
As expected, 5×FAD had fewer dendritic intersections than WT at a distance from soma around 50-100 μm, and SAL markedly increased dendritic intersections, across the same region (P < 0.01).
Of note, SIRT3 KD did significantly blocked SAL efficacy (P < 0.01) (Fig.
Conformably, the quantitation of total dendritic length showed a promotive effect of SAL, that was still dependent on SIRT3 expression (Fig.
Using the same Golgi staining, we further studied the spines locating at both apical and basal dendrites.
In keeping with the results of dendritic arborization (Fig.
Collectively, these results support the notion that SAL alleviates Aβ pathology and dendritic impairment in brains of AD mice and its efficacy is dependent on SIRT3 expression.

SAL upregulates SIRT3 transcription by directly inhibiting NRF2-KEAP1 complex formation
Considering that the transcription factor NRF2 can regulate SIRT3 expression in some systems including aging process
To test our hypothesis, we first used immunofluorescence to check the NRF2 localization in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with low and high concentration of SAL, or potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane (SFN).
As expected, SFN strongly increased nuclear levels of NRF2.
Interestingly, either 5 μM or 50 μM SAL induced an obvious translocation of NRF2 from cytosol to nuclei, although with a milder potency compared to SFN (Fig.
In addition, immunoblotting showed that SAL treatment upregulated the protein levels of NRF2 as well as SIRT3 (Fig.
However, the mRNA levels of NRF2 did not change (Fig.
These (See figure on next page.)

White scale bar, 500 μm; black scale bar, 50 μm; orange scale bar, 5 μm data refer that the NRF2 upregulation was not due to its transcription.
By detecting nuclear and cytosolic NRF2, we further confirmed that SAL promoted the nuclear translocation of NRF2 (Fig.
Given that SIRT3 mRNA was induced by SAL (Fig.
The E3 ligase adaptor KEAP1 is a principle negative regulator for NRF2.
Thereby, we tested whether SAL could disrupt the formation of NRF2-KEAP1 protein complex.
In KEAP1 immunoprecipitation (IP), 50 μM SAL definitely reduced the interaction of NRF2 with KEAP1 (Fig.
We also checked whether SAL directly bound to NRF2 by using a real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology.
To obtain the pure NRF2 protein for SPR use, we expressed the recombinant human NRF2 in Ecoli and purified it, showing by the Coomassie (Additional file 1: Fig.
SPR data indicated that SAL truly bound to NRF2 with a strong affinity (Fig.
The interaction of SAL and NRF2 was further confirmed by the cellular thermal shift assays and data showed that induced a much stronger stability of NRF2 protein (Fig.
Thus, our findings demonstrate that SAL directly binds to NRF2 and promotes its nuclear translocation by inhibiting attachment of the KEAP1 E3 ligase, ultimately resulting in an elevated transcription of SIRT3.

Discussion
Salidroside (SAL), a natural phenylpropanoid glycoside, is the main bioactive compound extracted from Rhodiola plants.
A number of studies have shown that SAL has neuroprotective activities in multiple neurological diseases including stroke, mood disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD
Of note, being free of side effect makes SAL attractive as a drug candidate.
The mechanisms of SAL protection possibly include the regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and even neural regeneration
However, the definite target molecules of SAL remain so far unknown, which largely limits its pharmacological study and clinical application.
In the present study, we identified NRF2 as a direct binding target of SAL in neuronal cells (Fig.
As for the mechanism of action, we found that SAL disrupted NRF2-KEAP1 interaction, promoted NRF2 translocating into nuclei, and facilitated SIRT3 expression for mitochondrial and neurite protection (Fig.
These findings thus provide new insights into SAL target identification and its pharmacological mechanism of action in AD, and possibly, a general working model in other NDs.
It's long been thought that the formation of dystrophic neurites is a vital event in AD pathogenesis
The damaged neurites are mainly caused by toxic Aβ oligomers released from the local aggregated senile plaques.
Given this pathological feature in AD, many studies mimicking the Aβ toxicity have been done by using various in vitro neuronal culture systems
By culturing both differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons, we found for the first time that SAL attenuated Aβ-induced neurite damage (Fig.
In accordance with previous studies in other AD models
But how can SAL reduce these AD pathological features?
The answers may include protective effects of SAL on neurons shown here, or its possible function on other glia cells such as microglia and astrocytes, because SAL was also reported to modulate microglia activity in spinal cord injury
Thus, we cannot entirely exclude that the SAL-mediated neuroprotection in AD mice is due to its indirect effect on glia cells.
It will be certainly interesting to investigate the gene expression profile and cell morphology of microglia or astrocytes in AD mice, particularly upon SAL treatment.
The regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis is crucial for either neurite outgrowth in development, or neurite injury upon pathogen stimulation
We then sought to assess the mitochondrial behavior during the process of SAL-mediated neurite protection.
The data showed that the mitochondrial morphology was abnormal when cells treated with Aβ oligomers or toxic CCCP, and SAL indeed restored the mitochondrial length and segment number in neurites (Fig.
These findings thus refer the involvement of mitochondrial activity in SAL-dependent neurite protection.
Recent findings strongly suggest that impaired mitophagy is likely critical for AD pathogenesis, and promotion of mitophagy may inhibit some AD pathologies
We thus speculated that mitophagy might be affected by SAL or Aβ treatment.
By using mKeima assays, double labeling of LC3 and mitochondria, and immunoblotting of protein markers in mitophagy pathway, we found that either Aβ42 or SAL alone, upregulated the basal level of mitophagy, while additional SAL treatment, not blocked but enlarged Aβ42-induced mitophagy (Fig.
These data suggest a possible reciprocal regulation: (1) Aβ42 induced mitochondrial damage, which directly recruited mitophagic machinery for clearance, lead to increased mitophagy index; (2) SAL pre-incubation already raised the basal level of mitophagy (Fig.
Our data thus support the notion that promotion of mitophagy may exert a protective function against AD pathogenesis.
Data in Fig.
However, the detail mechanism of SAL-mediated promotion of mitophagy has not been fully addressed in this study and it deserves further investigation in the future.
Besides mitophagy, we also found that SAL was able to improve the mitochondrial performance such as their morphology, MMP and ROS production (Fig.
To elucidate the mechanism responsible for SAL protection against neurite and mitochondrial injury, we turned to investigate the sirtuin family of proteins (SIRTs), which were considered as important neuroprotective molecules in the nervous system
Interestingly, SAL treatment upregulated the mRNA levels of nearly all the mitochondrial SIRTs, except SIRT5.
Among them, we focused on SIRT3, as a most studied one in mitochondrial regulation.
Strikingly, our data from SIRT3 KD, SIRT3 OE and SIRT3 KO cells all suggested that SIRT3 was absolutely required for SAL protection on neurites as well as mitochondria (Figs.
Our in vivo animal study confirmed that SAL had neuroprotective function against AD pathogenesis and its efficacy was also dependent on SIRT3 expression (Figs.
However, our limited animal study did not include the group of 5×FAD+SIRT3KD, which possibly could have severe cognitive defect than 5×FAD mice.
Based on the fact that 5×FAD+SIRT3KD+SAL almost restored it a similar level to 5×FAD (Fig.
We next extended our study into the mechanism of SIRT3 upregulation, by focusing on NRF2, a transcription factor implicated in regulating SIRT3 expression
Strikingly, our experiments demonstrated that SAL directly bound to NRF2 and inhibited the formation of KEAP1-NRF2 complex (Fig.
The detachment of KEAP1 from NRF2 lead to increased nuclear translocation of NRF2, and ultimately favored SIRT3 expression.
In the future, it will be worth to address some critical questions including: (1) whether and how NRF2 regulates other molecules in SAL-mediated neuroprotection?
and (2) whether and how SAL modulates the function of microglia or astrocytes in AD?
However, in a larger conjecture, our findings support the notion that SAL serves for mitochondrial and neurite protection in AD, dependent on the NRF2/SIRT3 pathway (Fig.

Conclusions
In sum, we find that a potential anti-aging drug SAL, can ameliorate Aβ-mediated neurite and mitochondrial damage in both cell culture and the 5×FAD mice.
Notably, SIRT3, as a vital regulator for mitochondrial homeostasis, is indispensable for SAL-mediated neuroprotection.
We further identify NRF2 as the first direct target of SAL, and elucidate a precise mechanism of action by which, SAL targets NRF2/SIRT3 pathway and attenuates Aβ

A schematic drawing shows the working model of SAL-mediated neurite and mitochondrial protection in AD.
Our findings suggest that SAL-mediated neurite and mitochondrial protection is dependent on SIRT3 expression.
An elucidated mechanism of action is shown: SAL directly binds to transcription factor NRF2 and prevents its degradation by inhibiting the attachment of E3 ligase KEAP1, then promotes nuclear translocation of NRF2, and eventually favors SIRT3 transcription
