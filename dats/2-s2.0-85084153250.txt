Shared Genomic and Proteomic Contribution of Amyloid and Tau Protein Characteristic of Alzheimer’s Disease to Brain Ischemia
Post-ischemic brain damage is associated with the deposition of folding proteins such as the amyloid and tau protein in the intra-and extracellular spaces of brain tissue.
In this review, we summarize the protein changes associated with Alzheimer's disease and their gene expression (amyloid protein precursor and tau protein) after ischemia-reperfusion brain injury and their role in the post-ischemic injury.
Recent advances in understanding the post-ischemic neuropathology have revealed dysregulation of amyloid protein precursor, α-secretase, β-secretase, presenilin 1 and 2, and tau protein genes after ischemic brain injury.
However, reduced expression of the α-secretase in post-ischemic brain causes neurons to be less resistant to injury.
In this review, we present the latest evidence that proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease and their genes play a key role in progressive brain damage due to ischemia and reperfusion, and that an ischemic episode is an essential and leading supplier of proteins and genes associated with Alzheimer's disease in post-ischemic brain.
Understanding the underlying processes of linking Alzheimer's disease-related proteins and their genes in post-ischemic brain injury with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease will provide the most significant goals for therapeutic development to date.

Introduction
Most studies on the consequences of cerebral ischemia have been conducted in rodents.
Preferring rodent ischemia and reperfusion brain research is supported by high homogeneity due to inbred, low cost, availability, and similarity of the brain vascular system in rodents and humans.
For several reasons, the hippocampus is the preferred brain sector for studying post-ischemic repercussions.
First, the CA1 area of the hippocampus is a brain region very sensitive to ischemic episodes.
Secondly, all regions of the hippocampus are involved in memory and spatial learning.
Third, the hippocampus is a structure that shows identical changes in the brain after ischemia and Alzheimer's disease.
Transient cerebral ischemia-reperfusion causes mass death of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region and in the third, fifth, and sixth layers of the cerebral cortex.
In the above structures, necrotic and apoptotic neurons were mixed with damaged neurons within seven days after ischemic brain injury
Within 6 months of recirculation, the number of damaged neurons decreased and the number of dead neurons increased.
During survival longer than six months after cerebral ischemia, acute and chronic neuronal changes in ischemic resistant areas were observed in addition to acute neuronal death in ischemic sensitive areas.
Changes occurred in areas of the brain that were not affected by primary ischemic changes, such as the CA2, CA3, and CA4 regions of the hippocampus
Neuronal death along with a decrease in the level of acetylcholine in the hippocampus was noted after ischemia, suggesting that neuronal death was caused by a deficiency of neuronal excitation
In addition, ultrastructural changes after ischemia were observed in hippocampus synapses
Other studies have shown that an episode of cerebral ischemia leads to the induction of synaptic autophagy, which may be associated with loss of neurons in the hippocampus after transient cerebral ischemia
Intracellular calcium increase post-ischemia
Following brain ischemia, calpain cleaves pre-and postsynaptic proteins, and calpain-cleaved proteins ultimately contribute to the death of ischemic neuronal cells
Changes in white matter and activation of neuroglial cells in the brain were observed in both humans and animals after ischemia
In experimental models of transient brain ischemia, ischemia causes serious alterations in both the corpus callosum and subcortical white matter
These alterations are consistent with the activation of neuroglial cells in the corpus callosum in the post-ischemic brain
Late atrophy of the white matter of the brain manifested itself as advanced spongiosis.
Ischemic changes in the brain showed signs of progressive neurodegeneration that developed slowly over a long period of time within recirculation after an episode of cerebral ischemia
Brain autopsy carried out within 1-2 years after ischemia showed the features of hydrocephalus
During this time, general atrophy of the hippocampus with very narrow cerebral cortex was observed
The final consequence of these changes is the development of dementia in experimental and clinical studies after cerebral ischemia
In addition, it was noted that post-ischemic neurodegeneration processes occur not only in the acute phase of ischemia but last throughout the recirculation period
The brain neurodegeneration profile that is observed after ischemia has common features with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease
This confirms an increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability after ischemia for inflammatory cells and leaks of amyloid and tau protein from the blood to the brain tissue, which in turn probably leads to irreversible and progressive damage to the entire brain
Understanding the deterioration of the mental state associated with brain neurodegeneration after ischemia sparked serious scientific debate.
Therefore, the role of amyloid and tau protein as additional causative agents in the development of dementia after ischemia has recently been noticed
Brain neurodegeneration due to ischemia-reperfusion has been found to be associated with the production and accumulation of folding proteins such as amyloid and tau protein
We present here changes in proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease and the expression of their genes (amyloid protein precursor, and tau protein) after ischemic-reperfusion injury of the brain and their role in post-ischemic neurodegeneration.
New advances in understanding the possible development of post-ischemic neurodegeneration have revealed dysregulation of the amyloid protein precursor, α-secretase, β-secretase, γ-secretase and tau protein genes.
In this review, we also present the latest evidence that Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins and their genes play an important role in the progression of brain neurodegeneration after cerebral ischemia.

Amyloid in Post-Ischemic Brain

In contrast, thirty days post-ischemia, the expression of presenilin 1 and 2 genes was below the control value (Table

The statistical significance of changes in expression of the amyloid protein precursor gene was between 2 and 7 and between 7 and 30 days post-ischemia
No statistical significance was found during the entire period after ischemia in the α-secretase gene
Statistically significant differences in the expression level of the β-secretase gene occurred between 2 and 30 days after ischemia
The statistical significance of changes in gene expression of the presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 was between 2 to 30 and between 7 to 30 days after ischemia

There was no statistically significant difference in expression levels of the presenilin 1 gene throughout the whole observation time post-ischemia
The results show that ischemic brain damage causes neuronal death in the hippocampus and medial temporal cortex in an amyloid-dependent mechanism, defining a new and very important process that ultimately regulates neuronal survival and/or death after ischemia (Tables

Dysregulation of Amyloid Associated mRNAs
Within 7 days after transient focal brain ischemia, the amyloid protein precursor mRNA increased by 150-200%
In another study, only amyloid protein precursor mRNA containing the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain was observed in the post-ischemic period
As a result of irreversible local brain ischemia, the mRNA of the amyloid protein precursor containing the Kunitz type protease inhibitor domain increased in cortex on day 21, but the total mRNA level did not change
In addition, after reversible focal post-ischemic brain injury, the 751 and 770 amyloid protein precursor mRNA increased within 7 days
Ovariectomized rats after local brain ischemia an hour after ischemia showed an increase in mRNA of the amyloid protein precursor
The estrogen treatment used reduced the mRNA of the amyloid protein precursor in areas of ischemia
In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid protein precursor is metabolized by α-secretase.
After experimental brain ischemia, mRNA α-secretase level and gene expression are reduced
In the amyloidogenic metabolism, the amyloid protein precursor is cleaved by βand γ-secretase to form β-amyloid peptide
There is evidence that ischemia activates the expression, production, and activity of β-secretase
Another study showed post-ischemic changes in the cortex and hippocampus at the mRNA level of three enzymes that metabolize the amyloid protein precursor: β-secretase, glutaminyl cyclase, and cathepsin B, whose levels increased rapidly
Presenilin mRNA, which is induced by brain ischemia
An increase in presenilin 1 mRNA was observed in the hippocampal CA3 region and dentate gyrus in animal studies of post-ischemic brain injury
Presenilin 1 mRNA had the highest level of expression on day 3 post-ischemia
In another study, elevated presenilins mRNA levels after ischemia were found in the hippocampus, brain cortex, and striatum
The maximum increase in presenilins mRNA was noted in the hippocampus and cortex.
An increase in presenilin 1 and 2 mRNA was observed in the cortex within 1-8 days after ischemia
In the hippocampus, presenilin 1 and 2 mRNA was upregulated in 4-8 days post-ischemia
The above observations help to understand the progressive neuronal death after an episode of cerebral ischemia with reperfusion, massive accumulation of β-amyloid peptide, as well as the slow development of dementia with the phenotype of Alzheimer's disease

Changes in Amyloid Staining in Animal and Human Brain
In animals after brain damage due to ischemia-reperfusion, with survival up to 1 year, staining of β-amyloid peptide was revealed in the intra-and extracellular space of brain tissue
Amyloid staining was observed after ischemia in neurons and neuroglial cells
Observed astrocytes with massive amyloid accumulation in the cytoplasm may be involved in the development of glial scars
In addition, reactive astrocytes with accumulated amyloid in the cytoplasm are probably involved in the pathological repair of post-ischemic brain tissue, accompanied by death of astrocytes
After ischemia, amyloid staining was found in the periventricular and subcortical white matter
It was found that the more intense the damage to white matter after ischemia, the more intense staining of amyloid in this area was
The abovementioned changes were associated with the appearance of leukoaraiosis after ischemia in the brain
Usually extracellular amyloid deposits occurred as very small dots or as diffuse amyloid plaques
Deposition of β-amyloid peptide in the form of diffuse plaques in response to experimental ischemic brain injury is not a transient phenomenon, since it has been observed that diffuse amyloid plaques transform into senile plaques about 1-year post-ischemia
Multifocal amyloid plaques have been reported in ischemic cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, corpus callosum and thalamus, and around the lateral ventricles.
The accumulation of β-amyloid peptide in ischemic neurons and astrocytes indicates the pathological role of amyloid in post-ischemic neurodegenerative processes of the brain
These data indicate that the increased accumulation of β-amyloid peptide in the brain after ischemia may be responsible for secondary neurodegenerative processes that worsen post-ischemic outcome through progressive neuronal loss
It is noted that after ischemia, amyloid is formed as a result of damage and death of neurons
Amyloid is a neurotoxic molecule and post-ischemia initiates pathological processes in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes that affect neurons and neuroglial cells, causing them to die
Accumulation of amyloid in various brain structures was noted during autopsy of human ischemic brains
After ischemia, diffuse and senile amyloid plaques have been shown in the arterial border zones and areas sensitive to ischemia
In addition, it was noted that amyloid was most often present in the middle layers of the brain cortex, which are very susceptible to ischemia.
Another study found mass accumulation of amyloid in neurons and perivascular areas in the brain post-ischemia due to cardiac arrest with survival of 1 month
In this study, senile amyloid plaques were described in two cases.
The hippocampal and cortical neurons, as well as epithelial and ependymal cells, were intensely stained for amyloid.
Gray and white matter cerebral vessels were surrounded by amyloid deposits that were mainly cuff-shaped
In some brains, the walls of cortical and meningeal vessels were intensely stained with amyloid.
According to another study, β-amyloid peptide 1-40 and 1-42 was found in the human hippocampus post-ischemia
Intensive amyloid staining suggests its involvement in the progression of neurodegeneration after ischemia and the development of dementia with the phenotype of Alzheimer's disease.
The results show that ischemic brain damage causes amyloid-dependent hippocampal neuronal death, thus defining a new, very important mechanism that ultimately determines survival and/or death of neurons after ischemia (Figure

Blood-Brain Barrier and Amyloid in the Blood
In patients during 4 days after brain ischemia due to cardiac arrest, the increase in blood βamyloid peptide 1-42 was approximately 70-fold compared with control
The value of growth correlated negatively with the clinical outcome post-ischemia
These studies provide direct evidence that human brain ischemia causes an increase in the blood level of β-amyloid 1-42 peptide.
The data indicate that acute cerebral ischemia may trigger an amyloidogenic process in Alzheimer's disease.
The level of serum amyloid growth probably reflects the degree of brain damage following an ischemic episode
In addition, the relationship between elevated blood amyloid level and clinical outcomes suggests a direct relationship between an ischemic episode and a level of βamyloid peptide 1-42, which is not secondary in the patients studied
In addition, a receptor for advanced glycation end products was found in the brains of patients after ischemia due to cardiac arrest in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and in the lining ependymal cells adjacent to the brain ventricles
The above cells form the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the cerebrospinal-brain barrier.
Staining for amyloid was observed in the walls of the choroid plexus blood vessels and in the basal membrane of the choroid plexus epithelium
Amyloid has been reported in cytoplasmic vacuoles of many epithelial and ependymal cells of the choroid plexus.
Data has shown that choroid plexus epithelium and ependymal cells equipped with a receptor for advanced glycation end products can play a significant role in the transport and accumulation of amyloid in brain tissue.
In addition, amyloid accumulation around the blood-brain barrier vessels suggests that β-amyloid peptide is derived from blood.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from clinical studies that showed an increase in blood amyloid level in patients following ischemic brain injury
In addition, experimental studies point to the passage of human amyloid from the blood through the ischemic blood-brain barrier
The receptor for advanced glycation end products may be the main therapeutic target in post-ischemic brain amyloidosis.

Tau Protein in Post-Ischemic Brain

Dysregulation of the Tau Protein Gene
A relationship has been demonstrated between hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage and tau protein gene expression after 10 min of global cerebral ischemia in rats, with survival 2, 7, and 30 days post-ischemia
In CA1 neurons, tau protein gene expression increased above the control value on the second day after cerebral ischemia (Table
On the seventh and thirtieth day of recirculation after an ischemic episode, gene expression was below the control values (Table
The statistical significance of changes in tau protein gene expression in rats was between 2 and 7 and 2 and 30 days after ischemia
In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, the expression of the tau protein gene after ischemia with a survival time of 2 days was below control values (Table
But 7-30 days after ischemia, tau protein gene expression was higher than control values (Table
The changes were statistically significant between days 2 and 7 and between days 2 and 30 after ischemia
The results show that ischemic brain damage causes neuronal death in the hippocampus in a tau protein-dependent mechanism, defining a new and very important process that ultimately regulates neuronal survival and/or death after ischemia (Figure

Tau Protein in Post-Ischemic Brain

Dysregulation of the Tau Protein Gene

Changes in Tau Protein Staining in Animal and Human Brain
A common appearance of immunoreactive tau protein neurons and neuroglial cells was found in human and experimental post-ischemic hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex
Some neurons were also labeled with tau protein antibodies after cerebral ischemia in humans due to cardiac arrest with 1 month survival
After focal cerebral ischemia, tau protein staining was also noted in microglia
The evidence presented indicates that some neuronal cells show changes in tau protein during post-ischemic brain injury [121] that may be associated with the degree of development of ischemic neuron death (Figure

Blood-Brain Barrier and Tau Protein in the Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid
Increased level of amyloid and tau protein after brain ischemia in serum
In addition, oxidative stress
Increased plasma tau protein
Ischemic brain injury with insufficient blood-brain barrier
The above suggests that brain damage as a result of an ischemic episode with reperfusion may play an important role in increasing plasma tau protein level
Increased level of tau protein in human blood was noted after ischemia due to cardiac arrest with two peaks on days 2 and 4, indicating the progression of neuronal changes
The observed two-stage kinetics of the increase in the level of soluble tau protein in plasma is consistent with two types of neuronal death-firstly by necrosis and secondly by apoptosis
It seems very likely that the profiles reflect the time course of acute and delayed ischemic damage or death of neurons
The above studies suggest that the level of tau protein in human blood can be used as a prognostic element of the neurological outcome after ischemia

Tau Protein Hyperphosphorylation
After transient local and complete cerebral ischemia, tau protein dephosphorylation was noted
But in another study after transient global cerebral ischemia due to cardiac arrest, the tau protein was gradually re-phosphorylated
In addition, a site-specific hyperphosphorylation of tau protein was observed in animals after transient focal cerebral ischemia
At the time of neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region after forebrain ischemia in gerbils, serine 199/202 hyperphosphorylation of tau protein was synchronized with GSK3, CDK5, and MAP kinases
New data indicate that in the brain after ischemia with reperfusion, modifications of tau protein by hyperphosphorylation are comparable to those found in Alzheimer's disease and are accompanied by apoptosis
The above observations indicate that in ischemic brain injury, apoptosis is directly related to tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Another study showed the production of paired helical filaments of tau protein after ischemia in animals
Additional studies provided data that the ischemia-reperfusion event of the brain was involved in the development of neurofibrillary tangle-like [136-138].
Neurofibrillary tangles were found after human cerebral infarction
In addition, the combination of cerebral ischemia with hyperhomocysteinemia in animals resulted in neuronal changes of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus caused by tau protein hyperphosphorylation
This study revealed an approximately 700-fold increase in the number of neurons with hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain after ischemia compared to control
Dysfunctional tau protein increases post-ischemic brain damage through iron export [149] and self-excitotoxicity (Figure

Discussion
This review features the response of amyloid and tau protein genes and their products to post-ischemic brain injury (Figures
Data showed that after ischemia, overexpression of the amyloid protein precursor gene began and correlated with the massive increase of soluble amyloid in blood (Figures
The data also revealed that after ischemia, overexpression of the tau protein gene in the brain began and correlated with the massive increase of soluble tau protein in blood (Figures
Increased expression of the amyloid and tau protein genes was parallel to the onset of delayed neuronal death after ischemic brain injury (Figure
The increase in brain and serum amyloid levels
Ischemia-induced increase in tau protein gene expression was parallel to overexpression of caspase 3 gene and caspase plays an important role in neuronal death (Figure
The data showed that activated caspase positively correlates with the development of neurofibrillary tangles
In addition, cognitive deficits are negatively correlated with levels of amyloid and tau protein
Data suggest that when tau protein is ischemically translated, its hyperphosphorylation increases, which means that hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is driven by the substrate, and transcription levels are identical to protein levels (Figure
Another study showed elevated Cdk5 levels in animals exposed to local reversible cerebral ischemia, confirming the above observations
An increase in tau protein hyperphosphorylation may be a consequence of increased translation or inhibition of its degradation or blocked clearance.
Data show that post-ischemic brain injury activates neuronal changes and death in the brain dependent on amyloid and tau protein, thus determining a new and important way to regulate neuron survival and/or death after ischemia (Tables
Induced pathological changes such as oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy and excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation by amyloid and tau protein determine their potential pathological mechanisms in the brain after ischemia (Figures

Expression of amyloid and tau protein genes and their brain and blood protein levels that are increased after ischemia (Table
One study provided evidence that the regional distribution of tau protein from neuropil to the neuronal body after cerebral ischemia was similar to that found in Alzheimer's disease
It is highly likely that the modified amyloid and tau protein additionally increase ischemic damage and/or neuronal death post-ischemia (Figures
The above evidence allows us to identify acute and chronic processes during neuronal death and the development of slow and progressive brain atrophy after ischemia with dementia with The presented facts confirm the opinion that brain damage after ischemia with reperfusion plays an important role in the pathological behavior of amyloid and tau protein in brain tissue and plasma (Figures

The above evidence allows us to identify acute and chronic processes during neuronal death and the development of slow and progressive brain atrophy after ischemia with dementia with the Alzheimer's disease phenotype (Figures
After cerebral ischemia in humans, the increase in plasma levels of amyloid and tau protein negatively correlated with clinical outcome, which reflected the degree of brain damage
It seems that post-ischemic brain injury promotes the development of irreversible neurodegeneration of the Alzheimer's disease type with massive neuronal loss
Although significant progress has recently been made in studying the pathogenicity of amyloid and tau protein after ischemia, key mechanisms involved in irreversible ischemic brain neurodegeneration induced by amyloid and tau protein are still unknown.
Post-ischemic brain damage has also been shown to induce neuronal death in association with amyloid and tau protein (Figures
The relationship between amyloid and tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease and experimental cerebral ischemia and ischemic stroke in humans appears to be significant.
According to the scientific observations, it can be stated that transient ischemic brain injury modifies tau protein and amyloid at both gene and protein levels (Figure
The conclusions presented from the exploration of Alzheimer's disease-related tau protein and amyloid and their genes in ischemic brain injury, which are partly associated with neuronal death by the development of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques (Figures
Since the decreasing importance of tau protein and amyloid in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is proposed [158-160] and it is believed that the deposition of tau protein and amyloid is not the reason of Alzheimer's disease, as presented in the NIA-AA Research Framework: towards the true explanation of Alzheimer's disease
Therefore, the animal models of brain ischemia with reperfusion used in the exploration of Alzheimer's disease seem to be a useful new methodology to clearing up the role of folding proteins and their genes in neurodegeneration of brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease.
Although the role of ischemia in amyloid changes and tau protein hyperphosphorylation is generally complex and requires further research, and amyloid and tau protein are a relatively underestimated pathological factors in the brain after ischemia in animals and humans, we have reason to believe that determining the role of these molecules in brain ischemia can help us understand the basis for developing a new treatment goals for ischemic stroke in a human clinic
Everything indicates that the regulation of amyloid and tau protein activity can be considered as a potential new therapeutic target in ischemic stroke [155-157,162,163].

Conclusions
Data indicate genomic and proteomic changes of amyloid and tau protein in post-ischemic hippocampus and medial temporal cortex.
Thus, two-sided damage to the above-mentioned regions causes a short-term memory deterioration, which leads to the inability to create new memories.
It is well-known that amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau protein are closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
However, further research is needed to determine whether damage and death of neurons in the hippocampus and medial temporal cortex are causative events or independent consequences of ischemia occurring in parallel and leading to the development of neuropathology and dementia after ischemia of the nature of Alzheimer's disease.
It appears that the prevention of ischemic brain damage and early treatment of ischemic stroke may have important implications for the development of Alzheimer's disease and deserve further research.
Thus, animal models of cerebral ischemia appear to be a useful experimental approach for determining the role of genes and proteins directly or indirectly associated with Alzheimer's disease.
In-depth research into the shared genetic and protein mechanisms associated with these two neurological diseases can accelerate the current understanding of the neurobiology of cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease, as well as conduct future research on cerebral ischemia or Alzheimer's disease in new directions.
