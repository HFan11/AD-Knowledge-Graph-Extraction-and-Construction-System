Kynurenic Acid Levels are Increased in the CSF of Alzheimer’s Disease Patients
Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a product of the tryptophan (TRP) metabolism via the kynurenine pathway (KP).
This pathway is activated in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer´s disease (AD).
KYNA is primarily produced by astrocytes and is considered neuroprotective.
Thus, altered KYNA levels may suggest an inflammatory response.
Very recently, significant increases in KYNA levels were reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients compared with normal controls.
In this study, we assessed the accuracy of KYNA in CSF for the classification of patients with AD, cognitively healthy controls, and patients with a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
Averaged KYNA concentration in CSF was higher in patients with AD when compared with healthy subjects and with all the other differentially diagnosed groups.
There were no significant differences in KYNA levels in CSF between any other neurodegenerative groups and controls.
These results suggest a specific increase in KYNA concentration in CSF from AD patients not seen in other neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that represents one of the major health problems in the world
The main pathophysiological features of AD are the in-brain accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in neuritic extracellular plaques, the hyperphosphorylated tau protein in intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and neuronal loss.
The consequence of the brain accumulation of Aβ and tau can be detected by analyzing the levels of Aβ 42 peptide (the most neurotoxic isoform of Aβ) and total tau (t-tau) protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients.
This analysis made it possible to establish these parameters as clinical biomarkers indicating that reduced Aβ levels and increased t-tau levels in CSF are distinctive of AD
The inverse correlation between Aβ 42 levels in the CSF and the brain is explained because Aβ 42 in the AD brain is sequestered in the cerebral neuritic plaques, as it is their main component, with less Aβ being available to diffuse into the CSF, and therefore reduced levels of Aβ 42 in CSF from AD patients (reviewed in
In the case of t-tau protein, CSF level probably reflects the intensity of neuronal damage and neurodegeneration (reviewed in
Although highly studied, the exact initiating and pathophysiological AD-initiating factors remain unknown, but the majority of AD-related research is based on the amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses.
In addition to these theories, different pathological mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation have been implicated in AD
Neuroinflammation in AD is associated with the activation of microglia and astrocytes along with increased levels of neuroinflammatory mediators and modulators such as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines
One consequence of microglial activation is the overproduction of quinolinic acid (QA).
This excitotoxin is a downstream-derived product from the kynurenine pathway (KP) and strongly contributes to the neuroinflammatory environment
KP is the main route that metabolizes tryptophan (TRP), and particularly, this pathway has also been implicated in AD
There is a bidirectional connection between inflammatory cytokines and the KP, and an imbalance in this association may possibly lead to neurological or psychiatric disorders
One study suggested that interleukin (IL)-6 activates the KP in patients with schizophrenia, leading to an increased production of kynurenic acid (KYNA)
It was shown that the KP regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, and that TRP metabolism reflects a crucial interface between immune and central nervous system (CNS)
Therefore, any imbalance in the KP and subsequently in the production of TRP metabolites may cause neuronal damage, giving rise to multiple physiological and neurological impairments
TRP is an essential amino acid necessary for protein biosynthesis, and a precursor of several compounds with important biological functions, such as serotonin, melatonin, and kynurenines
TRP enters the brain by a carrier-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier, where it is lately degraded.
KYNA is a product of the TRP metabolism via the KP, and it is synthesized in and released by astrocytes in the brain
KYNA is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptor antagonist and is considered to be neuroprotective
It counteracts the excitotoxic activity of other KP metabolites, such as QA
Increased levels of KYNA were found in AD brains and AD animal models, and authors explained that by exerting its antagonist abilities on NMDA and α7nACh receptors, KYNA may disrupt the learning and cognitive abilities
Additionally, increased levels of KYNA in the developing brain resulted in biochemical impairments and behavioral abnormalities
However, several reports showing KYNA and other KP metabolite levels in CSF and blood from AD patients and healthy subjects reached inconclusive results
Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), recent studies found increased KYNA concentration in CSF in different cohorts of AD patients
However, it was almost simultaneously published that KYNA levels were strongly reduced in CSF from AD patients when compared with control subjects
In this work, we aimed to clarify KP metabolite concentrations measured in CSF and serum and to determine their specificity in AD.
Therefore, we analyzed TRP and KYNA levels in CSF and plasma from a well-characterized cohort of patients who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, or one of a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Materials and Methods

Cohorts
In total, 132 subjects were included in this study: (i) elderly non-demented subjects classified as controls (n = 23); (ii) patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI) (n = 24); (iii) probable mild AD (n = 41); (iv) moderate-severe AD (n = 20); (v) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 8); (vi) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (n = 8); and (vii) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 8).
Subjects were recruited from the Neurology Service of three different geographical areas in Spain: 12 de Octubre University Hospital (Madrid); Donostia-Osakidetza University Hospital (San Sebastian); and Santa Creu i Sant Pau Hospital (Barcelona).
Diagnoses were based on detailed clinical assessments, neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging, electromyography, and CSF Aβ 42 and t-tau levels.
An ADindicative biomarker profile (Aβ + ) was defined as CSF Aβ 42 <550 pg/µL and t-tau/Aβ 42 ratio >0.52, according to ELISA manufacture instructions and reported cut-offs
Those cases with CSF Aβ 42 ≥550 pg/µL and t-tau/Aβ 42 ratio ≤0.52 were defined as non-AD biomarker profiles (Aβ -).
Diagnosis of MCI and dementia due to AD were established according to the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association guidelines
The majority of MCI patients were amnesic MCI but some of them presented an atypical non-amnesic MCI (visual variant or language variant).
These atypical cases were, however, then confirmed as MCI due to AD within their Aβ + CSF biomarker profiles.
Global cognition was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)
All FTD patients met the clinical diagnosis criteria of behavioral variant FTD
ALS and PSP diagnosis were established according to revised El Escorial criteria
All MCI and AD dementia patients had an Aβ + CSF biomarker profile, while it was Aβ -in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls.
Controls were usually recruited from among the patients' partners when they fulfilled the age and health criteria.
Inclusion criteria for old, cognitively-normal individuals were age over 50, no history or clinical signs of neurological or psychiatric disease, and absence of AD CSF biomarker profile.
Exclusion criteria for patients were evidence of concomitant cerebrovascular disease or any neurological, psychiatric, or non-neurological medical conditions; or medications that could affect cognition or motor function.
Consent was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval was obtained from the research ethics committee of the responsible institution (Research Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12:

Sample Collection
CSF samples were collected from all subjects and processed according to standardized procedures by lumbar puncture in 15-mL sterile polypropylene tubes.
Samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4 • C for 10 min.
Supernatant aliquots were stored at -80 • C into 0.5 mL polypropylene tubes with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland).
Blood samples were obtained through antecubital vein puncture from patients and healthy subjects.
Plasma was isolated from whole blood and collected in 7-mL-EDTA-2Na tubes.
Whole blood was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature.
Supernatants were then collected in tubes with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) and stored at -80 • C.

DNA Purification and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer instructions.
Human APOE C112R and R158C polymorphisms were detected to identify the APOE ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles, using LightCycler 480 II Instruments Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) following manufacturer instructions.

Aβ 42 and t-tau Quantification
Endogenous Aβ 42 and t-tau levels in CSF samples were quantified using INNOTEST ELISAs (Fujirebio Europe NV, Gent, Belgium), according to manufacturer's instructions.

KYNA and TRP Quantification
KYNA and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (L-5-HTP; from now on TRP) levels in CSF and plasma samples were quantified using an in-house competitive ELISA in triplo developed by the Bioelectrochemistry and Biosensors Group from the University of Alcalá in collaboration with the Nanobiotechnology for Diagnostics (Nb4D) group from IQAC-CSIC.
Analytical parameters found in CSF were a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.26 µg/L with an IC 50 of 23.6 µg/L and a linear range (LR) from 2.8 to 100 µg/L for KYNA; and a LOD of 2.5 µg/L with an IC 50 of 250 µg/L and a LR from 40-912 µg/L for TRP.
The immunoreagents used for KYNA detection (the polyclonal antibody (As301) and the enzyme tracer (HRP-SIA-IHSH)) were developed by the Nb4D group with the support of the ICTS "NANBIOSIS"; more specifically, by the Custom Antibody Service (CAbS, CIBER-BBN, IQAC-CSIC).
Their preparation and characterization will be described elsewhere.
The tryptophan hydroxylase polyclonal antibody (ref.
A 96-well ELISA microplate was coated overnight at 4 • C with anti-KYNA and anti-TRP primary antibodies.
Then, plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST).
After washing, following standards and CSF samples (50 µL), 50 µL of HRP-bioconjugates (HRP-SIA-IHSH or HRP-L-5-HTP) were added to each well and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Next, wells were washed and 100 µL of substrate solution were added.
After 30 min incubation, absorbances were measured at 450 nm using a Fisher Multiskan Go microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).
Inter-assay variability for KYNA and L-5-HTP assays was estimated at 21.4% (n = 17) and 21% (n = 4), respectively.
Intra-assay variability was estimated at 13.4% (n = 18) and 10.6% (n = 6) for KYNA and L-5-HTP, respectively.

Data and Statistical Analysis
Numerical data are shown as means ± standard deviations (SD) and categorical data as a percentages.
To compare demographic, clinical, and plasma and CSF biomarker data between groups, we used the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank test and non-parametric pairwise comparisons adjusted by Bonferroni.
Fisher's exact test was used to compare the distribution of categorical data across groups.
Correlations between biomarkers were assessed using Spearman rank correlation.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of KYNA from CSF to differentiate between the diagnostic groups.
The optimal cut-off point, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated in all cases.
Statistical significance was set out at p < 0.05.
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA/IC 14.2 for Windows, Texas, USA.

Correlations between KYNA and TRP Levels in Plasma and CSF
A crucial topic for studies of biomarkers in AD is whether concentrations in the brain or CSF are truly reflective of concentrations of the target(s) in peripheral fluids or tissues, such as blood.
To evaluate whether KP was also altered in blood, plasma levels of KYNA and TRP were determined in a patient's subgroup with MCI (n = 11), mild AD (n = 17), moderate-severe AD (n = 9), and healthy controls (n = 20).
Neither KYNA and TRP levels nor the KYNA/TRP ratio showed any significant change between patients and controls (Table
Plasma levels of KYNA (Figure
However, plasma TRP levels in the whole dataset significantly correlated with those levels in CSF (r = 0.28, p < 0.05; Figure

Discussion
The present study confirms that KYNA levels in CSF are significantly higher in MCI and AD dementia patients compared to healthy controls.
We extend this result showing that such an increase seems to be specific to AD, as it is not seen in other neurodegenerative disorders, including FTD, ALS, and PSP, where KYNA levels remained unchanged.
Our findings provide evidence of an association between KYNA levels in CSF and AD pathology, in agreement with recent studies
They are consistent with other works suggesting that increased KYNA levels in CSF from AD patients may represent an engagement of a compensatory mechanism counteracting neurotoxicity
KYNA, described as putatively neuroprotective
Additionally, KYNA has been shown to predict poor cognitive performance related to frontal executive functions and memory
In contrast, plasma KYNA concentration remained unchanged in MCI and AD dementia patients compared to healthy subjects.
This finding suggests that KYNA concentration in CSF does not depend on its systemic levels.

This finding suggests that KYNA concentration in CSF does not depend on its systemic levels.
TRP catabolism is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines
It has been shown that neural synthesis of KYNA takes place predominantly in astrocytes
Astrocytes are considered the primary source of extracellular KYNA concentrations
Studies in rodents showed that kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II)-the enzyme that converts kynurenine to KYNA-was strongly localized in astrocytes
We then may hypothesize that increased KYNA concentrations in CSF from AD patients in our cohort could reflect activated astrogliosis and increased astrocytic KAT activity, which could be part of the reactive changes that occur in astrocytes during neurodegeneration.
It is well established that neuroinflammation has a role in brains from AD affected subjects, which correlates with overproduction of kynurenine metabolites
During neuroinflammation, KP catabolizes 95% of TRP pool in brain, leading to the formation of several neuroactive metabolites.
This is consistent with the increased levels of KYNA reported in brains from AD patients
More interestingly, raised levels of enzymes initiating TRP oxidation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), were also reported in human AD brains.
It has been shown that IDO-1 expression was increased in hippocampi from AD patients
IDO-1 is up-regulated by certain cytokines, and inflammatory molecules such as Aβ peptides
Other study showed that IDO-1 is up-regulated in the brains of AD patients, and it was found to be associated with NFT and Aβ plaques
Altogether, these studies strongly support that the KP is potentially over-activated in AD, suggesting its role in the neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque formation.
Although it was proposed that the KP is deregulated in ALS
Ilzecka et al. reported that KYNA concentration in CSF was significantly higher in ALS patients with bulbar onset compared to healthy subjects, but there was no difference in KYNA concentration between the whole ALS group and healthy subjects
KYNA levels in CSF may also be increased upon inflammatory conditions following immune activation.
Elevated KYNA concentration in CSF was found in patients with inflammatory diseases, such as bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections; meningitis; autoimmune diseases; and septicemia, where autoimmune activation is present
Recent studies on AD-associated inflammatory pathways have found an important link between infections and the immune response
It was reported that many specific viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens are suspected to play a role in the progression of neurodegeneration due to AD, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), Chlamydia pneumonia, spirochetes, and Candida
Infection-induced inflammation triggers catabolism of TRP in several bacterial, protozoan, and viral infections, such as Chlamydia psittaci, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania donovani, and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2
TRP and its catabolites are well known for their immunosuppressive functions, disease tolerance, and contributions to immune-privileged sites, such as the brain
The relationship among cognitive deficits, KP mediators, and oxidative damage in the brain of an AD mouse model has been recently provided, showing an increase of TRP metabolites in the brain
Among other chronic neurodegenerative disorders, a decrease in KYNA concentration was detected in brain tissue and CSF from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients
However, more recent studies reported altered levels of KP metabolites in CSF from PD patients exclusively after L-DOPA treatment
Dysregulation of KP was not previously reported in FTD or PSP.
The present work agrees with a recent study describing KP metabolites in CSF and plasma samples from AD patients and correlations between these metabolites and well-established AD biomarkers (t-tau and phospho-tau)

Conclusions
Here we report in a new and large cohort, increased KYNA levels in CSF from AD patients compared to healthy subjects, including prodromal stages of the disease.
Our data clearly demonstrate that KYNA levels in CSF are specifically higher in AD patients but not in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders.
We propose that high KYNA concentration in CSF may reflect a compensatory mechanism in AD patients, based on its neuroprotective feature, but also an inflammatory response following putative immune activation.
Thus, we suggest that KYNA levels in CSF have potential as a diagnostic marker of AD in combination with the existing CSF biomarkers (Aβ 42 and tau).
