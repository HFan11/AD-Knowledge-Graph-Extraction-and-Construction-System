Interplay Between Microglia and Alzheimer’s Disease—Focus on the Most Relevant Risks: APOE Genotype, Sex and Age
As the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia regulates normal development, homeostasis and general brain physiology.
These functions put microglia at the forefront of CNS repair and recovery.
Uncontrolled activation of microglia is related to the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
It is clear that the classic pathologies of amyloid β (Aβ) and Tau are usually accompanied by the activation of microglia, and the activation of microglia also serves as an early event in the pathogenesis of AD.
Therefore, during the occurrence and development of AD, the key susceptibility factors for AD-apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, sex and age-may further interact with microglia to exacerbate neurodegeneration.
In this review, we discuss the role of microglia in the progression of AD related to the three risk factors for AD: APOE genotype, sex and aging.
APOE-expressing microglia accumulates around Aβ plaques, and the presence of APOE4 may disrupt the phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates and aggravate neurodegeneration in Tau disease models.
In addition, females have a high incidence of AD, and normal female microglia and estrogen have protective effects under normal conditions.
However, under the influence of AD, female microglia seem to lose their protective effect and instead accelerate the course of AD.
Aging, another major risk factor, may increase the sensitivity of microglia, leading to the exacerbation of microglial dysfunction in elderly AD.
Obviously, in the role of microglia in AD, the three main risk factors of APOE, sex, and aging are not independent and have synergistic effects that contribute to the risk of AD.
Moreover, new microglia can replace dysfunctional microglia after microglial depletion, which is a new promising strategy for AD treatment.

INTRODUCTION
As the resident macrophages of the central nervous system
As the main neuroimmune sentinels in the brain
These immune detection and defense functions put microglia at the forefront of CNS repair and recovery.
When the normal course of neurological development is disrupted, many neurological diseases can occur.
Uncontrolled microglial activation is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases
As an age-related neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia
It is related to progressive cognitive decline and memory loss
AD affects approximately 10% of the 65-year-old population and 50% of the 85-yearold population
In the next few decades, this number is expected to increase significantly
AD is characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques, consisting predominantly of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, and the intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles comprising aggregated, hyperphosphorylated tau protein
In addition to Aβ plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation is also considered to be a key feature of AD pathology
As the main source of proinflammatory cytokines, microglia are the key mediators of neuroinflammation
Single microglia sequencing confirmed the existence of a high proportion of activated microglia in APP transgenic mice
In AD-related lesions, the glial hyperplasia response may lead to the loss of cells after plaque and neurofibrillary tangle-accumulation
In contrast, chronic gliosis may also promote the accumulation of plaques and tangles before the onset of AD, leading to the progression of the disease
These findings suggest that microglia may actively participate in the pathogenesis of AD.
APOE genotype, sex and aging, the main risk factors for AD, affect the progression of AD and may interact with microglia to further aggravate neurodegeneration.
Targeting microglia may be a preventive intervention to delay the progression of AD.
In light of some new findings, in this review article, we will explore the role of microglia in the brain and how they interact with the factors of APOE genotype, sex, and aging to exacerbate AD.

PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF MICROGLIA Microglia in the Adult Brain
Microglia maintain and repair the damage to neural networks, which are the foundation of healthy brain development and function
Unlike, monocytes derived from bone marrow, the maintenance and local expansion of microglia depend on self-renewal
Mature microglia are in a resting state and are characterized by multiple branches and processes
Through two-photon imaging of the cerebral cortex in vivo,
It is worth noting that microglia are also sensors for brain pathology and can be quickly activated by minor pathological changes in the CNS
The phagocytic activity of activated microglia increases significantly to effectively remove neuronal debris

Microglia in the Developing Brain and the Difference Between Sexes
Microglia originate from red bone marrow progenitor cells in the yolk sac
Microglial development occurs for a certain period of time and developing microglia undergo gradual changes to regulate the homeostasis of the brain
In the developing brain, microglia repeatedly form short-term contacts with synapses, eliminating excess synaptic structures
Microglia not only participate in synapse pruning
These functions give microglia, the ability to monitor neuronal activity and regulate synaptic plasticity.
Studies in mice have shown that sex is linked to significant differences in microglia during and after development
For example, males have a significantly larger number of microglia in the early postnatal development period (postnatal day 4), while females have more activated microglia in the late developmental stages of adolescence and adulthood (postnatal day 30-60; Figure
To our surprise, there are more microglia with amoeboid morphology in males, while female microglia tend to reach the adult phenotype earlier than male microglia (Figure
In addition, females have a higher rate of phagocytosis of neural precursor cells and healthy cells than males (Figure
Microglia isolated from the brains of newborn female animals exhibited a higher degree of basic internalization of fluorescent beads and nerve debris than male microglia (Figure
In contrast, the microglia of male newborn animals exhibited higher internalization of E. coli bioparticles than the microglia of female newborn animals (Figure
However, these sex differences disappeared in microglia isolated from the brains of adults (5 months;
Given the above findings, we believe that the sex differences in microglia are mainly reflected during the developmental stage.
Compared with male mice, female mice have slight but significant differences in gene expression in different brain regions
In the early postnatal period, male mice have more microglia in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala than female mice (Figure
However, in adulthood, female mice have significantly more microglia in these brain FIGURE 1 | Sex differences in the development of microglia: the differences in the number of microglia and their distribution among the brain regions at different developmental stages are related to sex.
Females exhibit a higher rate of phagocytosis of neural precursor cells and healthy cells than males, and females have more phagocytic microglia than males.
After treatment with estradiol, the number of phagocytic microglia in female mice decreased to the typical level observed in male mice.
regions than male mice (Figure
The gene expression of a large number of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors changes significantly with development and is highly dependent on sex
Based on the above results, we believe that the sex differences in microglia are mainly reflected during the developmental stage, and female microglia may have a protective effect during the development.

Microglia in the Aging Brain
During brain development, microglia guide neurons for proper CNS formation; in adulthood, microglia maintain tissue homeostasis; and in old age, microglia may become proinflammatory and finally exhausted (Figure
However, we currently know very little about microglia in the aging brain.
Aging is one of the main risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases and is marked by an increase in CD68 expression and the accumulation of lipofuscin (Figure
Microglial process speed significantly decreases with age
The changes in the phagocytic activity of senescent microglia in vitro were similar to those of microglia purified from aged brains
In vivo imaging of young, adult, and aging mice showed that in addition to a slight increase in cell density, microglial morphology and behavior also changed (e.g., larger cell bodies, shorter dendrites, thicker dendrites, fewer branches, and decreased phagocytic ability and motor ability; Figure
During aging, the deposition of myelin in the parenchyma may exceed the processing capacity of microglia, leading to the accumulation of lipids and non-degradable lysosome aggregates (Figure
This observation has been confirmed: with age, myelin fragmentation increased, microglia entered a state of dysfunction, and insoluble lipofuscin-like lysosomal inclusion bodies appeared
Age-related myelin fragments overload the microglial lysosome system, resulting in microglial aging and immune dysfunction (Figure
Aging causes chronic inflammation of microglia (Figure
With age, the function of microglia decreased, the normal brain monitoring function is gradually lost, and the pathological conditions of the brain may not be detected and processed in time.
Therefore, the dysfunction of microglia in the aging brain may lead to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

Microglial Phenotypes
Previous studies have divided microglia into resting (M0), proinflammatory (M1), and proresolution (M2) microglia by purifying isolated cells in vitro, but these phenotypes are highly dynamic
When homeostasis in the nervous FIGURE 2 | Microglia in the aging AD brain: the signs of aging are an increase in CD68 expression and the accumulation of lipofuscin.
Aged mice have large microglia with short, thick dendrites, few branches, signs of malnutrition, and decreased phagocytotic and locomotor abilities.
Age-related myelin fragmentation overloads the microglial lysosomal system, and the accumulation of lipids and nondegradable lysosomal aggregates leads to microglial senescence and immune dysfunction.
As AD is a disease, closely related to aging, the microglia of the AD brain usually appear in clusters and gather around deposits of Aβ fibrils (discussed in the following section).
With aging, the protruding movement of microglial processes is significantly reduced, and microglial coverage is reduced, leading to an increase in Aβ fibril hotspots.
In addition to the upregulation of APOE, AD microglia also showed enhanced aging characteristics.
Microglia respond to brain tissue damage that accumulates in AD and during aging, leading to increased inflammation, further reduction in phagocytic and motor abilities, and neuronal communication disorders.
system is disrupted, microglia rapidly change their phenotype, which is often referred to as microglial activation
Among these phenotypes, M1 microglia have cytotoxic effects on neurons and oligodendrocytes cultured in vitro, while M2 cells have phagocytic abilities and can promote neurite growth
Some studies have suggested that long-term activation of M1 and suppression of the M2 state are the basis of the inflammatory phenotype in AD and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases
However, given the recent revelations regarding the complexity and dynamics of microglia, the M0/M1/M2-classifications based on in vitro studies may be too simple.
In fact, recent single-cell transcriptome studies have revealed several different microglial subsets and cellular states in aging and disease, including ''disease-associated microglia'' (DAM;
Among these subsets, DAM may be a protective phagocytic microglial cell population
Analyses of whole-tissue RNA-seq and single-cell nuclear RNA-seq datasets show that the lack of a DAM response in human microglia occurs in AD tissues, but not in other neurodegenerative diseases
To understand whether a microglial phenotypic switch from M0 (homeostatic) to MGnD (neurodegenerative) is related to neuritic dystrophy in AD,
As a result, they found Clec7a + P2ry12 -microglia associated with Aβ plaques in APP-PS1 mice
The phenotype of Clec7a + microglia was similar to that of MGnD microglia, found in APP-PS1 models and during aging
Although the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AD is a field of intensive research, whether the DAM and MGnD phenotypes are the same and their effects on the CNS (harmful or beneficial) may depend on the process and stage of the disease.

MICROGLIA AND THE MAIN RISK FACTORS FOR AD
In the developing brain, microglia can destroy invading microorganisms and remove harmful cellular debris
In general, microglia usually return to a resting state after the pathogen is cleared.
Nevertheless, if the CNS is exposed to activation stimulation for a long time, microglia will enter a dysfunctional state
Microglia change significantly in brain pathology, undergoing a complex multistage activation process
Amoeba-like microglia have neurotoxic effects that result in decreased phagocytosis and motor ability and the production of inflammatory cytokines (such as reactive oxygen species;
At this point, the CNS becomes fertile ground for acute or chronic pathological processes.
In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of genes associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), which are mainly expressed in the innate immune system and microglia
By studying human postmortem cortex tissue,
In LOAD, the complete loss of functional microglia eventually leads to widespread NFD, dementia and brain failure
Although the exact mechanism of AD pathogenesis is still unclear, integrated analysis of AD-related genes shows that the immune/microglial gene network has the strongest correlation with AD neuropathology
In view of the strong genetic evidence that microglia are involved in AD and that APOE, sex and aging are the main risk factors for AD, we will focus on summarizing their relationships with microglia below.

APOE and Microglia
The Role of APOE in Microglia APOE is the main cholesterol carrier in the brain, and APOE plays an essential role in lipid transport, cholesterol homeostasis and synaptic stability.
In the brain, APOE is mainly secreted by astrocytes, and microglia also produce APOE
Elevated cholesterol was observed in glial cells lacking APOE, reflecting impaired cholesterol transport in the brain
A single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) study showed that microglia in the brains of AD mice also exhibited high expression of APOE in the later stage of the disease
Interestingly,
Treatment of adult microglia with APOE inhibited the specific microglial characteristics of M0 and induce an M1-like phenotype
Notably, when microglia gather around amyloid plaques and release disease-related signals, the expression of APOE in microglia increases significantly
In humans, there are three main subtypes of APOE (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4), and they differ only at two amino acid positions (112 and 158;
APOE4 is the largest risk factor for AD, while the relatively rare APOE2 provides AD protection
In the process of activating neuronal signals, the three variants of APOE showed differential potentials (APOE4 > APOE3 > APOE2;
The inheritance of different APOE alleles can significantly affect the neurotoxicity caused by the natural immune response of glial cells
As the largest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, the expression of APOE4 changes the normal function of glial cells, which may increase the risk of AD
Studies of human postmortem brain tissue have found an increase in the number of microglia in AD patients who carry APOE4
Some studies have pointed out that APOE4 has an inherent impact on microglial physiology by increasing microglial movement and phagocytosis in vitro, so it may be the specific cause of microglial dysfunction associated with AD
In vitro, lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation was the greatest in the presence of APOE4
It can be seen from the above findings that only carrying the APOE4 gene variant is enough to transform resting microglia into immunologically active microglia
In vivo, APOE4 also increases susceptibility to central and peripheral inflammation in a gene dose-dependent manner
Therefore, APOE may be a key factor in microglial disorders in neurodegenerative diseases and may affect AD mainly by regulating microglial activation.

The Influence of APOE Subtype on Microglia and Aβ Pathology
Microglia are closely related to Aβ plaques in the AD brain.
In AD transgenic mice, there is a large amount of microglial infiltration in Aβ plaques, which are usually the focus of microglial aggregation and activation
Activated microglia mainly exist in and around neurons, or core plaques
In fact, diffuse amyloid plaques usually appear in the brains of older people with normal cognitive function, while dense core plaques, especially those associated with dystrophy, are most common in the brains of patients with AD dementia
In fact, microglial APOE may be the main source of APOE associated with amyloid plaques
Microglia play a role in the production of Aβ aggregates, and APOE4 may enhance the ability of microglia to participate in this pathological process
In a study, in which 5XFAD mice were bred with APOE3-or APOE4targeted replacement mice, the mice expressing APOE4 showed significantly larger and more abundant amyloid plaques and more microglial dystrophy (Figure
APOE4expressing microglia in the brains of APOE4 knock-in (APOE4-KI) mice may impair the phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates, leading to increased accumulation of Aβ aggregates (Figure
Microglia in mouse and human brains can accumulate aggregated Aβ intracellularly, which may be the critical first step in plaque formation
Early and long-term (21 days) use of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors (PLX3397) significantly reduced the activation of microglia and inhibited the accumulation of amyloid in nerves, and neuritis plaques (Figure
However, interestingly, some studies have shown that microglia play a beneficial role in densifying Aβ plaques and protecting neurites from damage
Microglia can form a protective barrier around amyloid deposits to isolate plaques from surrounding axons, thus preventing plaques from expanding outward and exerting toxic effects on neighboring neurons
The application of high-resolution confocal imaging and in vivo two-photon imaging in AD mice indicated the existence of this protective barrier in microglia and showed that it led to the formation of dense plaques with low Aβ affinity
As a new high affinity ligand of TREM2, APOE may direct microglia to target plaques by interacting with triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2; Figure
In the absence of TREM2, Aβ plaques were more diffuse and had lower density, resulting in greater neurite damage
Therefore, TREM2 deficiency prevents the formation of protective barriers of microglia that regulate the compaction of amyloid plaques
In the presence of APOE4, the coverage of Aβ plaques by microglia was also reduced, resulting in a significantly higher percentage of Aβ in the hippocampus and cortex
Therefore, we speculate that the presence of APOE4 abolishes the beneficial effect of TREM2 on the microglia barrier.
A recent study found that in human samples, either the pathological effect of AD was stronger than that of the APOE genotype or the effect of APOE4 was dependent on AD
Therefore, without an increase in familial AD (FAD) mutations, APOE3-KI and APOE4-KI mice did not produce Aβ aggregates in the brain
However, transforming APOE4 into APOE3 by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing enhanced the ability of microglia to take up extracellular Aβ (Figure
The Influence of APOE Subtype on Microglia and Tau Pathology
In fact, PET images in mice showed that tau accumulated before the activation of microglia, and severe brain atrophy occurred after microglial activation
In the tauopathy mouse model, microglia participate in the process of neurodegeneration which are the main driving force of neurodegeneration
Activated microglia not only aggravated the pathological changes of tau but also drove the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau
In the P301S-tau transgenic dementia mouse model, mice carrying human APOE4 exhibited more significant brain atrophythan mice carrying other APOE variants, such as APOE2 and APOE3
Individuals carrying APOE4 have microglial dysfunction.
Moreover, compared with mice expressing APOE2 or APOE3, microglia-mediated cell damage was greater in mice expressing APOE4
The presence of APOE, especially APOE4, significantly aggravated neurodegeneration in P301S mice (Figure
However, APOE knockout (APOE-KO) had a strong neuroprotective effect in tauopathy mice (Figure
Microglia in APOE-KO mice still engulfed dead neurons, but the MGnD phenotype did not appear
The microglia of P301S-tau transgenic mice aged 6-9.5 months were depleted by PLX3397, which completely blocked the progression of tau pathology (Figure
However, using the same method to reduce microglia in the aged mouse model of invasive tau disease did not lead to changes in tau lesions or neurodegeneration
In addition, a slight reduction in microglia (∼30%) did not change the tau load or cortical atrophy in the mouse model of tau disease
Controlling the activity of microglia may not be an effective strategy against the pathological changes of tau because higher doses of PLX3397 or early intervention may be required during the course of the disease.

The Influence of Sex on Microglia and AD
The sex difference in microglial function may be one of the factors affecting the differences observed between men and women in the susceptibility and prognosis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases (Figure
Compared with males, females have more phagocytic microglia (Figure
After treatment with estradiol, the hormone responsible for masculinizing the rodent brain, the number of phagocytosing microglia in female mice decreased to the typical level observed in male mice (Figure
Female microglia expressed lesser proinflammatory genes and had neuroprotective effects in ischemic animal models
However, in APP NL-G-F mice, the microglia of female mice progressed faster on the ARM trajectory than those of male mice
After ovariectomy in APP23 mice (an animal model of chronic neuritis replicated in AD patients), it was found that microglia developed to a high reaction state, and a large number of microglial response markers were upregulated
Increased expression of inflammatory markers was also observed in postmenopausal women, especially in the functional areas of the brain that responded most strongly to inflammation
This sex-dependent difference in microglial response is interesting because the incidence of AD is higher in women
Therefore, we speculate that normal female microglia and estrogen have a protective effect, but under the influence of AD, female microglia no longer have a protective effect but instead accelerate the course of female AD.

The Influence of Aging on Microglia and AD
The average age of onset for sporadic AD is above the age 65 years old, and age is the main risk for AD
Microglia deteriorate due to age and cell aging but also due to certain risk factors (as observed in genetically and environmentally induced AD; Figure
Resting microglia have neuroprotective effects, but during aging and AD, changes in microglial proliferation, morphology and motility are signs of decreased microglial function
Compared with the microglia of aged AD mice, the microglia of young AD mice significantly lengthened and contracted their protrusions, and their protrusions moved more (Figure
Microglia in AD usually appear in clusters and gather around fibrous Aβ deposits (Figure
With aging, microglia exhibit significantly less process movement, and the coverage of microglia decreases, leading to enlarged protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots and more serious neuritic dystrophy
Aging and systemic diseases push individual microglia toward the proinflammatory phenotype, which damages the connectivity of the neural network, leading to neuropsychiatric diseases
Microglia respond to brain tissue damage accumulated during aging and neurodegeneration, resulting in increased inflammatory reactions, disturbances in neuronal communication, and decreases in phagocytosis and motor ability (Figure
In this case, the ability of microglia to monitor the brain and respond to various injuries is weakened
As expected, neuroinflammation in the brains of aged mice lasted longer than that in the brains of adult mice
The delayed response of microglia in the brains of aged mice to injury may affect the pathological outcomes of aged animals after brain injury.
By imaging acute brain slices by two-photon microscopy in vivo,
Compared with the microglia of young mice, the microglia of old mice had larger cell bodies, shorter dendrites, thicker dendrites, fewer branches, and signs of malnutrition (Figure
As AD is a disease closely related to aging, it may not be entirely surprising that microglia of the AD brain share some phenotypes with aging microglia.
The consequence of these aging-and AD-related proinflammatory phenotypic changes in microglial communication is the impairment of the synaptic plasticity and cognitive ability of neurons
In vitro experiments showed that aged microglia could not engulf Aβ as effectively as young microglia
Compared with those in wild-type control mice, the morphological changes of microglia in aged AD mice were most obvious in the pathological area containing Aβ plaques
The above results show that, as a disease closely related to aging, AD causes microglial changes similar to those caused by aging.
Aging may increase the sensitivity of AD to microglia, leading to further aggravation of microglial dysfunction in elderly AD.

THE CROSSTALK AMONG APOE, SEX AND AGING IN MICROGLIA
Notably, in the development of Alzheimer's disease in reality, the three major risk factors for AD-APOE genotype, sex, and aging do not affect microglia independently.
Aging can be clearly defined the greatest risk factors for AD and its effect on microglia are consistent.
With aging, APOE genotype and gender contributed to the pathogenesis and development of AD by affecting microglia through synergistic effect.
APOE4 genotype is the strongest genetic factor of sporadic AD.
The age of AD onset in APOE4 genotype carriers was earlier than that in non-APOE4 carriers, suggested that the effect of APOE4 genotype on AD onset goes hand in hand with age.
APOE4 disrupts normal glial cell biology and intersects with changes that occur during normal aging, resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction
A great deal of evidence showed that there is a strong connection between microglial activation in AD patients and the APOE genotype, especially related to aging
Compared with non-aged mice, the microglial proteome of aged mice showed enrichment of the APOE protein
A proteomic analysis of the postmortem human brain also showed that APOE expression was higher in aged microglia
In AD and aging mouse models, microglial APOE mRNA was upregulated (Figure
These results suggested that aging alone is sufficient to induce APOE expression in microglia at the mRNA and protein levels, then accelerating the impact of APOE on the development of AD.
Interestingly, there is a gender effect that women with APOE4 carriers at higher risk for AD-related pathology, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles
ARM cells are the dominant microglial cell type in APP NL-G-F mice, while the proportion of ARM cells in females is higher than that in males, and the response is earlier and more pronounced, especially in older mice
It is noted that plaque compaction is a beneficial result of the interaction between microglia and plaques, but the APOE4 genotype and female were showed associated with lower plaque compaction
Microglial coverage of plaques was highest in male APOE3 mice, while the microglial coverage observed in APOE4 mice and female mice was significantly lower, meanwhile the amyloid level was increased
It has been reported that the aged microglia of female mice may lost the ability to adapt their phagocytosis to inflammatory conditions
With aging, estrogen resistance may be related to the impaired ability of microglia to reduce inflammation.
Although carrying the APOE4 genotype is not necessary or sufficient for the development of AD, these observations may indicate that ARM increases the vulnerability of this critical pathway, especially in older women with APOE4 carriers.
Therefore, we speculate that ARM cells may further aggravate AD pathology by synergistic interaction with APOE4 genotype, low circulating estrogen in aging women, and pro-inflammatory factors induced by aging, AD pathology may worsen with the increase of ARM cells in female APOE4 carriers.
In summary, aging is the driving factor that expanding the APOE4 or gender factor for AD risk, and it is no doubt that microglia play the central role to affect the occurrence and development of AD between the interactions of these risk factors.
In future, a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the increased risk of AD is critical to developing interventions and determining who will benefit the most.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Microglia are essential for maintaining normal brain function and have been recognized as having a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.
As microglia colonize the brain early in embryonic development, environmental and/or genetic disturbances may alter the development, synaptic pruning and surveillance of microglia or cause other pathologies that may directly or indirectly lead to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases.
In general, the role of microglia in alleviating or promoting the pathological development of AD may be mediated by the specific factors, they release and the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
As the resident immune cells in the CNS, microglia play a key role in maintaining brain homeostasis.
Genetic studies have shown that microglia play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AD.
In general, microglia can remove harmful cell debris.
When Aβ levels accumulate, microglia phagocytose and clear Aβ aggregates.
When the capacity of this activity is exceeded, microglia form a barrier that tightly envelops Aβ aggregates in dense core plaques and separates them from neurons.
These activated microglia are dependent on TREM2 and assisted by APOE.
However, in response to the activation of microglia, the two hallmark AD pathologies, Aβ plaque and tau pathology, may show opposite trends.
Sometimes, due to aging or genetic susceptibility, the function of these microglia is insufficient to prevent the occurrence and development of AD.
The aging of the global population has led to a rapid increase in the incidence of AD, and there is a growing need for an effective therapy for AD to improve the quality of life of elderly patients with AD.
Microglia are considered to be the key mediators of neuroinflammation during AD.
Changing the function of microglia in disease states is the subject of in-depth research and provides opportunities for developing innovative AD treatments.
These include therapeutic strategies to inhibit the inflammatory response of microglia (e.g., with NLRP3 inhibitors and RIPK1 inhibitors; Heneka
What needs special attention is that recently many pharmacological strategies have been developed to successfully eliminate microglia from the central nervous system (Table
Although in a variety of AD in mice, decrease of microglia CSF1R antagonists have different results, but most studies have found that microglia reduce improved cognition
CSF1R inhibitors are the effective tools to achieve microglial depletion.
Microglia account for 30%-99% of all cells could be eliminated by preparing different concentrations of inhibitors in food, so as to achieve comprehensive control of microglia population.
Moreover, removal of the CSF1R inhibitor from mice with depleted microglia caused the entire CNS to rapidly reproduce new cells within 14 days
This treatment strategy also has limitations and concerns.
Since microglia are the main immune cells of the CNS, long-term elimination of human microglia is currently not feasible
In view of the effect of CSF1R inhibitors, the ability to replace microglia by stopping CSF1R inhibitor treatment also has obvious clinical value, whether it is possible to delay the course of AD by eliminating the microglia after extensive nerve damage and allowing them to completely refill the CNS depends on whether new cells can replace the microglia lost in brain.
The current clinical use of CSF1R inhibitors further confirms that short-term administration of CSF1R inhibitors can effectively eliminate human microglia
Therefore, short-term elimination of microglia and cell proliferation may be a clinically feasible and novel method to solve neuroinflammatory events and promote brain recovery in brains affected by microglial dysfunction
However, Since the recently obtained information on the different roles of microglia mainly comes from studies in mouse disease models, it is necessary for us to develop new disease models, including human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs;
Here, the increased understanding of APOE genotypes, sex and aging in microglia provides a new, microglia-focused therapeutic approach for AD that is fundamentally different from current methods for Aβ or tau.
The discovery of sex differences in susceptibility provides a basis for sex-related therapy, which must be based on a better understanding of the relationships among the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems of young and aged individuals.
Microglia replacement may be a new method applicable in many cases, especially in the elderly AD population.
Microglia extensively manipulate the structure and function of neurons to produce beneficial results.
These results provide new insights into the behavior of microglia.
Since intervention in the late stages of dementia is unlikely to change the disease, treatment should take into consideration the disease stage, and be designed to alleviate neuroinflammation according to the exact disease stage, which would provide the possibility for the development of effective treatments targeting microglia.
Whether microglia depletion and subsequent regeneration is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD, is still an open question.
More research is needed to clarify the extent to which aged microglia can be restored to their protective functions and reset their aging clock.
The beneficial and harmful effects of the microglia rejuvenation strategy still need to be considered to promote the development of safe and effective microglia-targeted therapies.
In the future, replacing or manipulating microglia, combined with the transplantation of iPSC-derived neurons, will give us the opportunity to analyze these two possibilities.



FIGURE 3 |
FIGURE 3 | Activation of the role of APOE in microglia under different pathological conditions.
APOE in plaques may increase Aβ clearance by binding to TREM2 and activating microglia, promoting microglial migration and phagocytosis, and its efficacy varies with APOE subtype (APOE2 > APOE3 > APOE4).
Through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, converting APOE4 to APOE3 can enhance the ability of microglia to absorb extracellular Aβ.
Similarly, the presence of APOE (especially APOE4) significantly aggravates the neurodegeneration of p301 mice.
However, APOE-KO has a powerful neuroprotective effect in tauopathy transgenic mice, reducing the activation of microglia and improving brain atrophy in mice.
CSF1R inhibitor-mediated depletion of microglia in P301S-tau transgenic mice can also completely prevent the progression of tau pathology.
