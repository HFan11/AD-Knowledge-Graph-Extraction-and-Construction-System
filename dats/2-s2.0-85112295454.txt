Possible Mechanisms of Tau Spread and Toxicity in Alzheimer’s Disease
Tau is a protein that associates with microtubules (MTs) and promotes their assembly and stability.
The protein loses its ability to bind MTs in tauopathies, and detached tau can misfold and induce the pathological changes that characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD).
A growing body of evidence indicates that tauopathies can spread between cells or connected regions.
Pathological tau transmission in the brain of patients with AD and other tauopathies is due to the spread of various tau species along neuroanatomically connected regions in a "prion-like" manner.
This complex process involves multiple steps of secretion, cellular uptake, transcellular transfer, and/or seeding, but the precise mechanisms of tau pathology propagation remain unclear.
This review summarizes the current evidence on the nature of propagative tau species and the possible steps involved in the process of tau pathology spread, including detachment from MTs, degradations, and secretion, and discusses the different mechanisms underlying the spread of tau pathology.

INTRODUCTION
The microtubule (MT)-binding protein tau is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons
Tau protein changes affect its MT-binding ability and consequently alter its normal physiological functions.
For example, the phosphorylation of tau protein in and around its microtubule-binding domain (MBD) may neutralize its positive charges
Once detached, tau accumulates in neurites and neuronal cell bodies, where it forms insoluble intracellular aggregates or inclusion bodies such as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are one of the major pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
Following detachment from MTs, tau can undergo structural transition, misfolding, and degradation
Tau can also be secreted into the extracellular space
In agreement with these findings, exogenous misfolded tau protein can be internalized by cells
Once internalized, pathogenic misfolded tau proteins act as "seeds" that recruits soluble endogenous tau into larger aberrant conformations
Fibrillar tau species can also transfer between cells and then recruit endogenous tau proteins onto their ends
Tau pathology spreading between neuronal cells and adjacent brain regions is a complex process involving many physiological and pathological aspects of tau protein, including its degradation, secretion, transmission, and toxicity.
However, the exact mechanism underlying the spread of tau pathology after its release from cells remains unclear, and understanding these processes is the focus of an increasing number of studies
There is some evidence that progressive accumulation of tau pathology in affected brain regions during AD development is due to the spread of aggregated tau along anatomically connected pathways
Accumulation of aggregates leads to neuronal loss and trans-synaptic spread of tau aggregates to more distal regions of the brain
The spread of extracellular species is the main pathway propagating neurofibrillary lesions and tau toxicity throughout different brain regions in neurodegenerative diseases
A better understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying tau propagation will contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for halting this process and provide new perspectives for the early diagnosis and prevention of tau pathologies
This review covers the most recent advances in our understanding of tau-spreading mechanisms, as well as the underlying implications of tauopathy-associated toxicity in AD.
We further outline the possible mechanisms involved in pathology propagation including tau protein detachment from MTs; tau cleavage; tau degradation; and the release, uptake, and movement of pathogenic tau among synaptically connected neurons

PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND DISSOCIATION OF TAU PROTEIN FROM MTs
Tau protein can be divided into four functional domains: an N-terminal projection region, a proline-rich domain, an MBD, and a C-terminal region
Tau can bind to the outside-and possibly also the inside-of MTs with the N-and C-terminal regions projecting out
The N-terminal region can associate with the cell membrane and may be as a part of a membrane-associated complex; it also regulates the spacing between MTs
The proline-rich domain includes multiple phosphorylation sites
Tau protein not only plays a crucial role in regulating MT dynamics but also promotes MT assembly and stabilization, processes that are required for morphogenesis and axonal transport in the nervous system
However, the ability of tau to stabilize MTs is due in large part to its MBD
Tau is thought to directly bind MTs through positively charged tandem repeat sequences within its MBD that are attracted to tubulin's negatively charged residues
The human tau gene, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), is located on chromosome 17q21 and comprises 16 exons.
Alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 generates six isoforms of the tau protein
They are equally expressed in central nervous system neurons of a healthy adult brain
Because of the extra repeat, 4R isoforms have a higher affinity for MTs and can therefore bind and stabilize MTs more efficiently
Tau protein functions are regulated by complex posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, glycation, isomerization, sumoylation, nitration, acetylation, and truncation
Moreover, tau contains numerous serine and threonine residues, so almost 20% of the protein has the potential to be phosphorylated
The phosphorylation state of tau and its MT-binding affinity are controlled by a balance between kinase and phosphatase activity
Tau phosphorylation is mediated by MT affinity-regulating kinases (also known as PAR1 kinases), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A, calcium (Ca 2+ ), or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and tyrosine kinases like Src family members
The activation of tau phosphorylation-associated kinases (e.g., CDK-5 and GSK-3β) can induce tau hyperphosphorylation, which drives dissociation of tau protein from MTs
Dissociated tau can misfold and become toxic seeds that are secreted from the cell.
In contrast, fully dephosphorylated tau binds to MTs with high affinity
Tau dephosphorylation is mediated by protein phosphatases 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, and 5
In addition, detached tau can accumulate in neurites and neuronal cell bodies, first forming insoluble filaments and eventually NFTs
Abnormal tau phosphorylation decreases MT binding and likely increases tau-tau interactions
Physiologically, tau is continuously phosphorylated and dephosphorylated to ensure its proper function; however, when the balance shifts toward phosphorylation, tau affinity for MTs decreases
Additionally, aberrantly phosphorylated tau protein appears to sequester other microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), further destabilizing MTs
Similarly, aberrant tau phosphorylation and self-aggregation lead to the formation of oligomers and higher-order aggregates that can lead to tau detachment from MTs and disturb the binding of other MAPs to

TAU PROTEIN CLEAVAGE AND DEGRADATION
Tau cleavage and degradation are closely related to its pathological transmission and aggregation.
The cleavage of tau generates seeds that promote tau aggregation
Tau cleavage occurs at its
Tau truncation can be initiated by caspase-3, which cleaves tau at residue D421, its predominant target
Caspase-3 can be activated by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and caspase-2
Cleavage at D421-S422 produces the N-terminal fragment (NTF) tau 1-421 (Tau-C)
Caspase-2 is a protease that initiates activation of other caspases; it cleaves tau at D314-L315 to produce a soluble, toxic NTF (tau 1-314 ; tau 314 ;
Tau 1-314 levels were elevated in the brains of mice with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in the brains of AD patients compared with healthy controls
Moreover, memory deficits were ameliorated following the application of anticaspase-2 morpholino oligonucleotides
However, in vitro experiments using recombinant tau preparations suggested that caspase-2 preferentially cleaves tau at D421-S422
Another effector caspase, caspase-6, and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) were reported to cleave recombinant human tau 441 at D13-H14
Caspase-6 cleavage at D402-T403 produces the NTF tau 1-402 , a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for AD
In addition, calpain-1 and -2 can both cleave tau
The 17-kDa tau 45-230 fragment is generated through cleavage by calpain-1 at K44-E45
Tau is also cleaved by calpain-1 at R242-L243 to produce the 24-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) tau 243-441
The levels of the tau 243-441 fragment increase with aging in a tauopathy mouse model (Tg601 mice expressing wild-type human tau), and CTFs with sizes ranging from 20 to 28 kDa are present in brain samples from patients with AD and familial frontotemporal dementia
Tau 243-441 can proficiently propagate to other tau-expressing cells, leading to further seeding and tau 441 phosphorylation
Interestingly, tau 441 build up can activate calpain-2, which leads to the degradation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 4
Calpain-2 activation by tau 441 creates a positive feedback loop that enhances neurotoxic tau fragment generation.
Cathepsins B, D, and L can also proteolytically cleave tau.
One study reported that cathepsin B was associated with intracellular NFTs, and its expression was elevated around Aβ plaques
Cathepsin D can cleave recombinant tau at F8-E9, M419-V420, and L436-A437; there is another potential cleavage site at either T427-L428 or L428-A429 and additional cleavage sites in D34-G161, P200-K257, and K267-D358
In Neuro-2A murine cells, cathepsin L can cleave tau 244-372 (lacking K280; tau RD K), which is a mutated version of the aggregation-prone MBD tau fragment
Tau RD K cleavage by cathepsin L depends on an initial cleavage at K257-S258 by an unknown cytosolic protease that generates tau 258-372 ; this fragment is further cleaved by cathepsin L at V363-P364 to produce tau 258-363 that is subsequently cleaved at I360-T361 to produce tau 258-360
Tau 258-360 and tau 258-363 induce aggregation of intact tau RD K and full-length tau, which is coincident with lysosomal leakage
Asparagine endopeptidase-mediated tau cleavage occurs at both N255-V256 and N368-K369 and produces five tau fragments.
Among them, tau 1-368 and tau 256-368 were the only critical drivers of enhanced apoptosis in rat primary neurons, while only tau 1-368 has been found in the brains of patients with AD
Intracellular tau degradation mainly involves two major proteolytic systems: ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagylysosomal
Full-length tau is cleared via the former system
Moreover, tau phosphorylation can exacerbate its proteolytic degradation
Tau can undergo natural self-degradation at cysteine residues by acetyl-coenzyme A-induced autoacetylation
Tau accumulation can also result from increased expression or decreased degradation of the protein
Thus, tau acetylation may both inhibit and facilitate its degradation and also suppress its phosphorylation and aggregation
Acetylated tau has been found in brains from patients with AD and other tauopathies.
For example, Lys174 acetylation was recently described in AD brains and may be a critical determinant for tau-induced toxicity by delaying tau turnover
This result indicates that targeting tau acetylation could be a novel therapeutic option for AD and other human tauopathies.

SECRETION AND RELEASE OF TAU FRAGMENTS
Although tau is intracellular, recent studies have indicated that it is also present in the extracellular space both in vitro  and in vivo
Tau has been detected in both the CSF and interstitial fluid of tau transgenic mouse brains
In vitro studies have shown that human tau is secreted by both neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines when the protein is overexpressed
Extracellular tau may elicit toxicity
Another study showed that tau can be released into the extracellular space following neuronal death
Secreted extracellular tau can be toxic to surrounding cells through interactions with specific cell receptors
This toxic effect may result in cell death and the subsequent detection of tau in the CSF of patients with disorders such as AD
Additionally, in affected regions such as the hippocampus, there is an inverse relationship between the numbers of surviving cells and extracellular tangles
This suggests that degenerating neurons containing fibrillar lesions might release NFT contents into the extracellular environment
Meanwhile, several in vitro and in vivo studies reported that stimulation of neuronal activity can regulate the physiological secretion of endogenous tau by cortical neurons and enhance the release of pathological tau, a process that is Ca 2+ -dependent and modulated by phosphorylation
AMPA receptor stimulation promotes A small amount of tau can be released into the extracellular space in free form or by penetrating adjacent membranes, which can be achieved by stimulating neuroactivity or constitutive secretion.
However, the methods involved in unconventional tau protein secretion include (1) non-vesicular direct translocation across the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm and extracellular trapping via HSPGs, (2) release via secretory lysosomes that fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space, (3) microvesicle shedding from the plasma membrane, and (4) vesicle-mediated exosome release.
Tau can also be secreted by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells when tau protein is exogenously expressed, while extracellular tau can bind muscarinic (M1, M3) receptors.
Tau may also be released through nanotubes that connect the cytoplasmic compartments of adjoining cells.
tau release through a Ca 2+ -dependent mechanism and the exocytosis of presynaptic vesicles.
AMPA receptor stimulation generates action potentials that increase presynaptic Ca 2+ concentrations, evoking vesicle release
The relationship between neuronal activity and tau release appears to be bidirectional; both extracellular tau and Aβ perpetuate further neuronal tau release through feedback mechanisms
These results indicate that tau release partially occurs in a neuronal excitability-dependent manner in response to regional changes in the AD brain.
Tau can also be detected in the extracellular space before neurodegeneration, indicating that it can be released through mechanisms other than cell death
Preliminary results demonstrated that tau can be released into the extracellular space via membrane vesicles in the absence of cell death
Tau secretion likely transpires via the unconventional vesicularor non-vesicular-mediated secretory pathway since tau lacks an apparent endoplasmic reticulum-targeting sequence, which is necessary in the conventional secretory pathway
Vesicle-mediated secretion might serve as a mechanism to regulate (proteostasis) cellular tau concentrations, maintaining them below a certain threshold level
Tau can also be transported through membrane vesicles after lysosomal degradation
Four different mechanisms have been proposed for the unconventional secretion of soluble, cytoplasmic tau: (1) non-vesicular direct translocation from the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane, (2) release via secretory lysosomes that fuse with plasma membranes and release their contents into the extracellular space, (3) microvesicle shedding from the plasma membrane, and (4) vesicle-mediated exosome release
In the last two scenarios, tau is surrounded by a membrane when it is released into the extracellular space
It has also been proposed that tau may be released from cells through an exosome-independent pathway that requires heat shock cognate 70, its co-chaperone DnaJ (Hsp40), and synaptosomalassociated protein 23
Additionally, tau secretion reportedly occurs through membrane vesicles when tau is overexpressed
Similarly, tau can be secreted in an exosome-dependent manner by Neuro2a cells overexpressing tau
Another vesicular-mediated mechanism involves large extracellular vesicles called exosomes that are directly shed from cells by plasma membrane budding
The third mechanism proposed to mediate tau release and spreading involves formation of thin membranous bridges called tunneling nanotubes (TNTs;
Moreover, cell depolarization was shown to induce FIGURE 4 | Tau pathology spread.
Once released into the extracellular space, tau can be transported to connected cells via exosomes or ectosomes.
Tau can also be transported to other cells by binding to muscarinic (M1, M3) receptors or synaptic receptors or via special structures such as membrane microdomains and HSPGs.
There may also be nanotubes between cells, which can also spread tau oligomers.
The plasma membrane may play a role in tau transmission through endocytosis-mediated uptake of tau oligomers.
Microglia can also phagocytose secreted tau oligomers that are then spread to healthy neurons in exosomes, and astrocytes may be involved in this process.
Both microglia and astrocytes can secrete cytokines that act on connected neurons, which further accelerates tau pathology.
However, the specific mechanisms underlying the roles of microglia and astrocytes in tau pathology spread remain unclear.
When tau oligomers or monomers are released by lysosome or ingested by recipient cells, they will misfold and form toxic seeds, PHFs, or NFTs.
Once the recipient cells spread the pathological tau fragments to other cells, this perpetuates a vicious cycle that exacerbates AD.
the release of a 20-kDa tau fragment from AD synapses
These four mechanisms appear to be temperature dependent and are likely to be less efficient at low temperatures
Different forms of tau protein might be secreted through different mechanisms or vectors.
Endogenous tau released from primary cortical rat neurons under basal conditions is predominantly full length
Tau fragments lacking the proline-rich region are either not secreted or are secreted in a manner different from that of the full-length molecule
Monomeric and aggregated tau have been detected in CSF, suggesting that they may be released following axonal degeneration and neuronal death
However, other studies found that unstimulated human and rodent neurons only secrete C-terminally truncated forms of endogenous tau
Cell culture studies revealed that tau is released via the unconventional secretory pathway and that tau mutations influence the secretion rate, with 4R tau isoforms less abundant than 3R isoforms
Moreover, exogenously expressed hyperphosphorylated tau secreted by non-neuronal cells is cleaved at its C-terminus
For instance, tau cleavage at D421 can increase the secretion rate
Aberrantly phosphorylated tau is secreted more efficiently than non-phosphorylated tau, at least in cultured cell lines
Meanwhile, endogenous tau is reportedly released either free and in a full-length, dephosphorylated form
A small subset of tau released under these conditions is inside plasma membrane-derived vesicles called ectosomes
Tau is also released from cells in association with exosomes, particularly when it is exogenously expressed or in a highly phosphorylated and misfolded state
One study suggested that tau hyperphosphorylation in AD may induce a vicious circle that amplifies its secretion
In this case, tau hyperphosphorylation would enhance its secretion, which would subsequently increase the level of dephosphorylated tau in the extracellular space.
Dephosphorylated extracellular tau would then induce an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations, which has been linked with elevated tau hyperphosphorylation
This vicious circle then promotes tau pathology propagation in the brain and CSF accumulation
Golgi dynamics were also proposed to modulate tau secretion from both HeLa cells and primary cortical neurons
Tau cleavage and hyperphosphorylation increase its secretion from HeLa cells.
Mitochondrial damage might reduce tau secretion
Pathological tau in animal models appears to be more localized to synapses compared to non-pathological tau
In summary, different tau species and isoforms including mutated

THE SPREAD OF PATHOLOGICAL TAU PROTEIN
Although the specific routes and mechanisms underlying the spread of pathological tau remain unclear
First, tau must be secreted or released from donor neurons; second, it must undergo aggregation before or after being released; third, tau must be taken up into recipient neurons; and fourth, tau aggregation must be induced in recipient cells
After the release and secretion of tau to the extracellular space following cell death
Subsequently, pathological tau seeds might be degraded, resecreted, or mediate the misfolding of wild-type tau molecules in recipient cells
Recipient cells appear to favor the uptake of short, low-molecular-weight, tau fibrils over monomers and larger fibrils
Consequently, the potencies of various tau aggregate species on cellular propagation may be different
For example, tau uptake is closely related to both the size and conformation of tau aggregates
Intracellular tau accumulation is dependent on the isoform composition of the extracellular tau oligomers
However, tau aggregate uptake is not neuron specific; cell-to-cell transfer also occurs between glial cells and neurons.
Tau aggregates can transfer between connected cells, induce templated misfolding, and be internalized from the extracellular space by a neighboring cell, which facilitates tauopathy propagation across different brain regions in a prion-like fashion
Tau oligomers can be internalized by dynamin-dependent bulk endocytosis and are then transported through the endolysosomal pathway in recipient cells
One study demonstrated that neuronal uptake of α-synuclein and tau aggregate seeds can occur through macropinocytosis, a form of fluid-phase bulk endocytosis that represents the most likely mechanism for tau uptake.
This process begins when aggregated proteins bind to HSPGs, a family of core proteins with cell-surface glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides.
Interestingly, the internalization process is only initiated by aggregated species, not by monomeric tau
Another study also suggested that HSPGs can mediate exosome internalization
Before internalization via micropinocytosis, tau binds to plasma membrane HSPGs, which promotes membrane rearrangement before endocytosis
Tau binding to HSPGs seems to be essential for internalization, and the 6-O-sulfation pattern on heparan sulfate sidechains is an important determinant for tau binding
However, heparan-like glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetics can hide tau's HSPG binding site, which reduces cellsurface tau oligomer binding, uptake, and seeding
HSPG-dependent macropinocytosis is instigated by small protein aggregates, and tau trimers were shown to be the smallest size able to initiate this mechanism
The results of a recent study also supported the hypothesis that different tau species could be internalized through different cellular mechanisms
For example, tau monomers and small oligomers are preferentially taken up by macropinocytosis, while dynamin-dependent endocytosis is the preferred route for larger aggregates.
HSPGs and macropinocytosis may also play a role in the uptake of whole exosomes
In short, endocytosis and/or pinocytosis might be favored over direct fusion to the plasma membrane as an exosome internalization route
During this process, vesicles can be endocytosed by neighboring cells, which might be involved in the propagation of misfolded or aggregated tau proteins in different neurodegenerative disorders
Meanwhile, micropinocytosis might be critical for pathological tau uptake both in vitro and in vivo
Tau aggregates are reportedly internalized into primary neurons, where they are trafficked anterogradely and retrogradely along axons, and then spread to connected cells
They can also seed the aggregation of native monomers, thereby initiating more aggregates that are then released and spread to neighboring cells
Recent reports found that inoculation of preformed tau fibrils into tau transgenic mice quickly induced an AD-like NFT pathology in connected brain regions
Moreover, misfolded tau proteins spread through anatomically connected neurons, presumably via trans-synaptic tau aggregate transmission
However, preformed tau aggregates can also spread by means other than synaptic connections, suggesting the existence of alternative (non-synaptic) propagation pathways
How neurons release tau that is then transmitted to recipient neurons to instigate tau propagation remains unclear.
Although synaptic connections can facilitate tau's transcellular spread, other cellular uptake routes cannot be excluded.
Once internalized, tau can be located in both early and late endosomes, which links these tau species to lysosomal vesicles in a retrograde axonal pathway and provides further evidence for a transsynaptic route of transmission
Extracellular vesicles play a major role in cellular communication and the transport of pathogenic proteins related to AD
Notably, exosomal tau protein levels are elevated in prodromal AD
Microglia also contribute to tauopathy progression via exosome secretion, such that microglia depletion and inhibition of exosome synthesis can dramatically suppress tau propagation in vitro and in vivo
Additionally, astrocytes can internalize both fibrillar and monomeric tau, implying that these cells are also be involved in tau pathology spread
However, one study found that oligomers and short fibrils that bind to the membrane can be internalized by neuronal cells via a receptor-independent mechanism, while tau monomers, long fibrils, and long filaments cannot
Thus, these structures (exosomes, ectosomes, or TNTs) mediate neuron-to-neuron transfer of pathological tau protein assemblages, which is considered a fast manner of tau spread that is prion like
Tau protein modifications can also affect the spread of tau pathology.
Tau hyperphosphorylation can enhance spread, while partial dephosphorylation slows it
This observation indicates that tau hyperphosphorylation may be a potential target to prevent tau pathology progression in AD and other tauopathies
Tau fibrils can propagate by incorporating unphosphorylated tau monomers that undergo conformational changes and are then hyperphosphorylated
The extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein might be involved in tau fibril uptake into cells
It is well known that increasing Aβ42 oligomerization can activate protein kinases (including GSK-3β) that phosphorylate tau
Aβ aggregation can promote tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that Aβ might accelerate the spread of tau pathology

TOXICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPREAD OF TAU PATHOLOGY
Tau is normally enriched on MTs within axons.
In tauopathies, tau is hyperphosphorylated and accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment of brain cells, which is one of the pathological hallmarks of AD
Tau aggregates into insoluble filaments, forming NFTs
Tau phosphorylation, mislocalization, and conformational changes can alter Ca 2+ homeostasis, induce dendritic spine loss, impair organelle trafficking (particularly mitochondria), and lead to cell death
These phenotypes represent a pretangle stage, which is widely recognized as an early event in the pathological process of AD
Three hypotheses have been proposed to underlie tau-mediated toxicity.
First, insoluble NFTs may be toxic and lead to neuron death and cognitive dysfunction in AD; second, soluble species of misfolded, hyperphosphorylated tau may become toxic when they accumulate in inappropriate cellular compartments, whereas NFTs exert a protective effect by serving as a sink for these toxic species; and in the third view, soluble forms of pathological tau and insoluble NFTs are both toxic to cells in various ways and time scales
We favor the third view.
Neuronal transport disruption is considered an important form of tau toxicity, which is an early phenomenon and underlying cause of neurodegenerative conditions including AD
Recent studies have found that soluble tau species are related to synaptic or neuronal dysfunction
Based on these results, the interneuronal spread of these soluble tau species might be involved in the spread of AD pathology through the brain
Furthermore, neurons can endocytose low-molecular-weight misfolded tau species (but not monomeric tau) that are transported anterogradely and retrogradely, resulting in endogenous tau pathology in vivo.
However, they cannot endocytose fibrillar tau or brain-derived filamentous tau
This evidence strongly indicates that tau toxicity may be mediated by the cell-to-cell spread of trimeric and larger oligomeric forms in certain brain regions by endocytosis
Extracellular tau is neurotoxic
When the extracellular level of free tau exceeds that inside the cell and reaches a critical concentration
Paired-helical filament (PHF)-tau is less toxic than free tau.
When tau interacts with muscarinic receptors, intracellular Ca 2+ levels increase due to Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores
Tau seeds can also cause toxicity and cell death via Ca 2+ dysregulation
Tau phosphorylation will increase tau detachment from MTs
Free tau is then released during neurodegeneration or following cell death and binds to muscarinic receptors on surrounding cells, thereby inducing muscarinic toxicity and aggravating tau toxicity and transmission
In addition, different tau forms or isomers secreted into the extracellular space via different mechanisms may play varied roles in AD pathogenesis.
Certain forms of tau released through cell death or neuroactive stimulation may be non-toxic, while misfolded tau fragments or seeds (induced by Aβ, kinases, and hydrolases) exert toxic effects on the extracellular space.
Secreted vesicles containing tau protein inhibit tau binding to muscarinic receptors, thus reducing neurotoxicity.
The neurodegenerative consequences of tau hyperphosphorylation include axonal transport impairment
Synaptic dysfunction can occur both presynaptically, where it can interfere with the transport of phosphorylated tau via synaptic vesicles
In the context of the prion hypothesis, tau assemblies that enter the cytoplasm can seed native monomer aggregation, and these species can be released and spread to neighboring cells
Under pathological conditions, aberrant posttranslational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation, truncation, deamidation, and others
When neurons degenerate and die, this free tau enters the extracellular space, where it is free to diffuse in every direction
This is in line with the observation that neuron loss is progressive within brain areas affected by degeneration, and tau species can seed misfolding in human brains without tangles
This implies that tau seeds are released from intact neurons prior to neuronal death
Another possible explanation of tau pathology patterns in the brains of AD patients is that extracellular NFTs or other substances released by degenerating neurons accumulate in the extracellular space and damage nearby cells
These toxic compounds can act like extracellular Aβ peptides
Thus, both soluble tau species and insoluble NFTs may contribute to the spread of tau toxicity.

CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
The mechanism involved in the transcellular propagation of tau in neurodegeneration is still unclear.
Studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the release, propagation, and uptake of tau are needed; improving the ability to detect secreted tau species is also important.
Future research should focus on reducing the secretion and generation of extracellular tau in a soluble or aggregated form and inhibiting cell uptake.
However, tau aggregate species are diverse, and it is currently unclear if certain species prefer certain secretion pathways.
It will be important to clarify whether the physiologic secretion of non-pathological tau from neurons occurs via the same or overlapping mechanisms as those for the pathologic forms.
Moreover, both forms of tau secretion are connected to neuronal activity, so blocking synapse-mediated tau propagation and boosting the clearance of tau aggregates that are internalized at the synapse are equally important
More attention should also be given to glial cells and the glymphatic system, which might play a role in clearing and propagating pathological protein aggregates.
Inhibition of donor cell release and recipient cell uptake are also novel therapeutic directions worthy of consideration.
For example, it might be possible to block exosome secretion pathways and apply tau antibodies that can act on pathological tau fragments in the extracellular space and inhibit tau aggregation on membranous structures.
Recent studies have shown that anti-tau antibodies can reduce tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in the transgenic mouse brain
In addition, preventing tau from binding to HSPGs precludes recombinant tau fibrils from inducing intracellular aggregation and blocks transcellular aggregate propagation.
In vivo, the heparin mimetic F6 prevents neuronal uptake of tau fibrils injected stereotactically
Moreover, microglia disseminate tau via exosome secretion, and hampering exosome synthesis significantly reduces tau propagation in vitro and in vivo, which implies that exosomes and microglia contribute to tauopathy progression.
It also suggests that targeting the exosome secretion pathway could be therapeutically useful.
Depleting microglia dramatically suppressed tau propagation and reduced excitability in the dentate gyrus in a mouse model of AD
In summary, tau release mechanics can be explored to develop new treatments for AD and other tauopathies.

FIGURE 1 | Structural features of the tau protein.
The human tau gene, microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), contains 16 exons; alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 generates six tau protein isoforms: oN3R, 1N4R, 2N3R, 0N4R, 1N4R, and 2N4R.
Full-length human tau protein (2N4R) contains 441 amino acids and four functional domains: an N-terminal projection region, a proline-rich domain, a microtubule-binding domain (MBD), and a C-terminal region.
The N-terminal inserts are N1 and N2.
The proline-rich domains P1 and P2 contain many phosphorylation sites and can bind to SH3 domains of other proteins, such as the tyrosine kinase Fyn.
R1-R4 make up the repeat domain, which, together with the R'-flanking region, constitute the MT-binding domain.
Two sequences are necessary for tau aggregation: 275 VQIINK 280 and 306 VQIVYK 311 .



FIGURE 2 |
FIGURE 2 | Detachment of tau protein from MTs.
The full-length tau protein binds to MTs, stabilizing them under the regulation of phosphatases (e.g., PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, and PP5).
When tau protein phosphorylates, tau protein will detach from MTs.
The microtubules will destabilize and dissociate.
Detached tau fragments form tau aggregation, which ultimately leads to the formation of NFTs.
At the same time, phosphorylated tau protein and detached tau fragments misfold and form tau oligomers, which are the precursors of NFTs, or toxic tau seeds.



FIGURE 3 |
FIGURE 3 | Tau protein secretion and release.
The possible mechanisms underlying the presence of tau in the extracellular space include cell death, neuroactive stimulation, constitutive secretion, and unconventional secretion.
A small amount of tau can be released into the extracellular space in free form or by penetrating adjacent membranes, which can be achieved by stimulating neuroactivity or constitutive secretion.
However, the methods involved in unconventional tau protein secretion include (1) non-vesicular direct translocation across the plasma membrane from the cytoplasm and extracellular trapping via HSPGs, (2) release via secretory lysosomes that fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space, (3) microvesicle shedding from the plasma membrane, and (4) vesicle-mediated exosome release.
Tau can also be secreted by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells when tau protein is exogenously expressed, while extracellular tau can bind muscarinic (M1, M3) receptors.
Tau may also be released through nanotubes that connect the cytoplasmic compartments of adjoining cells.
