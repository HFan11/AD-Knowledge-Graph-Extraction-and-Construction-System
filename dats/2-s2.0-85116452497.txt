Retinal Vasculopathy in Alzheimer’s Disease
The retina has been increasingly investigated as a site of Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation for over a decade.
Early reports documented degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axonal projections.
Our group provided the first evidence of the key pathological hallmarks of AD, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) plaques including vascular Aβ deposits, in the retina of AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients.
Subsequent studies validated these findings and further identified electroretinography and vision deficits, retinal (p)tau and inflammation, intracellular Aβ accumulation, and retinal ganglion cell-subtype degeneration surrounding Aβ plaques in these patients.
Our data suggest that the brain and retina follow a similar trajectory during AD progression, probably due to their common embryonic origin and anatomical proximity.
However, the retina is the only CNS organ feasible for direct, repeated, and non-invasive ophthalmic examination with ultra-high spatial resolution and sensitivity.
Neurovascular unit integrity is key to maintaining normal CNS function and cerebral vascular abnormalities are increasingly recognized as early and pivotal factors driving cognitive impairment in AD.
Likewise, retinal vascular abnormalities such as changes in vessel density and fractal dimensions, blood flow, foveal avascular zone, curvature tortuosity, and arteriole-tovenule ratio were described in AD patients including early-stage cases.
A rapidly growing number of reports have suggested that cerebral and retinal vasculopathy are tightly associated with cognitive deficits in AD patients and animal models.
Importantly, we recently identified early and progressive deficiency in retinal vascular platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ) expression and pericyte loss that were associated with retinal vascular amyloidosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in MCI and AD patients.
Other studies utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT), retinal amyloidfluorescence imaging and retinal hyperspectral imaging have made significant progress in visualizing and quantifying AD pathology through the retina.
With new advances in OCT angiography, OCT leakage, scanning laser microscopy, fluorescein angiography and adaptive optics imaging, future studies focusing on retinal vascular AD pathologies could transform non-invasive pre-clinical AD diagnosis and monitoring.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of senile dementia, accounting for 60-80% of total cases
By 2050, over six million Americans are projected to live with AD, which could lead to a staggering $355 billion national financial burden (National Institue on Aging, 2019;
AD patients progressively develop irreversible cognitive loss due to neurodegeneration in the brain and other direct or indirect factors such as accumulation of toxic molecules, neuroinflammation, and vascular damage.
The main pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid β-protein (Aβ) accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles, mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated (p)tau deposits, that may exist inside or outside of neurons and in blood vessels
Our group identified these hallmarks in the retina of postmortem and living AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients
Investigation of CNS and fluid biomarkers has become an essential part of AD research.
In 2018, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) created an updated research framework for classifying pathological phases of AD based on detection of abnormal levels of molecular biomarkers Aβ (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration [AT(N)], regardless of cognitive status in living patients
The ATN framework was also proposed to be expandable to include new AD biomarkers such as vascular biomarkers (ATNV)
Vascular pathology in AD is an expanding subject and a growing number of studies show that vascular-related damage in the brain and retina can predict cognitive decline
Cerebral vascular damage such as ischemia leads to disturbed nutrient supply, induces oxidative stress and inflammatory activities, impedes Aβ clearance and/or alters amyloid-processing enzymes
Studies have also proposed that the onset of clinical dementia may be preceded by reduced cerebral blood flow associated with insufficient Aβ clearance
With new disease-modifying therapies on the horizon and emphasizing the need for early intervention

Vascular Damage in AD Brain
The brain is nourished by one of the human body's richest networks of blood vessels
Studies indicate that AD pathology is associated with severe effects on cerebral blood vessels, potentially by a wide range of complications
These include cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
Amyloid plaques are the most considerable hallmarks of AD, with 42 and 40 amino acid-long Aβ alloforms tightly associated with AD pathogenesis and vascular pathology
Nearly 85% of AD patients develop varying degrees of CAA complications
Accumulation of Aβ within blood vessels is associated with damage to muscular and elastic tissue, possibly replaced by Aβ fibrils, leading to lobar cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or vascular non-perfusion
CAA can also trigger other pathogenic pathways, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, further leading to cerebral tissue damage

Alzheimer's Retinopathy
Over the past decade, the retina has been extensively investigated as a top candidate site of AD manifestation beyond the brain, as it shares many structural, cellular, molecular, and functional similarities with the brain
Given the parallel pathology in the brain and retina, the retina has the potential to become a non-invasive diagnostic window since it is not shielded by bone and is easily accessible by ophthalmic exams such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundoscopy (including scanning laser ophthalmoscopy) with subcellular resolution.
The retina is directly and indirectly connected to the brain through bundles of neuronal axons forming the optic nerve, and by retinal and cerebral blood vessels, which may facilitate transportation of abnormal Aβ and tau species and further lead to the spread of AD pathology throughout the CNS
In addition, the discovery of dysfunctional lymphatic vessels within the brain of rodent models of AD implicates this CNS-specific lymphatic network, referred to as the glymphatic system
Recently, an ocular lymphatic drainage system was also identified in rodent models, which relies on an aquaporin-4-dependent pathway to clear fluid and metabolites
The roles of such lymphatic systems in retinal diseases and AD remain to be explored in future studies.
Studies conducted by OCT, electroretinogram (ERG), and histological examinations on cognitively impaired patients and laboratory animals have extensively described various retinal pathological and functional changes associated with AD development.
In fact, the retina is heavily affected by AD pathology and displays a wide spectrum of retinopathy (reviewed in
This includes optic nerve degeneration and retinal neuronal and ganglion cell (RGC) loss
This retinal damage can explain, at least in part, the visual dysfunctions
Such findings have largely encouraged basic research in the AD retina and exploration of retinal imaging techniques for AD diagnosis.
Our group was the first to demonstrate the existence of Aβ accumulation, the hallmark AD pathology, in the retina of AD patients, including early-stage cases.
In a study published in mid-2010, we revealed the aggregation of Aβ deposits in retinal flat-mounts isolated from 13 out of 13 neuropathologically confirmed AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) patients, which was minimally or undetected in 5 cognitively normal (CN) subjects negative for brain amyloid
Further, this pioneer study demonstrated for the first time the ability to non-invasively detect curcumin-labeled Aβ deposits in live murine models of AD
Importantly, similar reductions in retinal and brain Aβ plaques were detected ex vivo and in vivo in ADmodel mice
Although a few studies failed to detect Aβ and/or (p)tau in the retina of AD patients, these reports included low case numbers
It is possible this discrepancy in findings could also be due to differences in retinal tissue preservation, processing, and/or immunostaining protocols.
Subsequent studies by La
Retinal amyloidosis in AD patients was in stark contrast to minimal pathology observed in the retinas of CN individuals
In 2017,
Authors utilized immunofluorescence, anti-Aβ compound labeling, non-fluorescence immunostaining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to measure Aβ 42 plaque burden, characterize retinal Aβ plaque subtypes and morphology including identifying retinal Aβ fibrils and protofibrils, and describe Aβ plaque topographical and layer distribution in a larger cohort of 23 AD patients vs. 14 ageand sex-matched CN patients
In this study, several Aβ-epitope labeling techniques including Gallyas silver stain, curcumin, thioflavin-S, congo red, as well as a combination of monoclonal antibodies against various N'-, C'and center Aβ sequences were used to describe amyloidosis in the human AD retina.
Hence, together with post-mortem detection by immunofluorescence staining, peroxidase-based staining, and TEM analysis on retinal flat-mounts and crosssections, this study profoundly validated Aβ accumulation in the AD retina in comparison to CN controls.
We also demonstrated a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaque burdens, and more importantly, provided the first proof-of-concept trial using curcumin labeling and a scanning laser ophthalmoscope to detect and quantify retinal Aβ plaques in living patients,
Indeed, multiple biochemical and histological studies corroborated these findings of Aβ deposits in the human AD retina
More recently, in vivo retinal amyloid imaging in living MCI and AD patients was achieved via either retinal curcumin-enhanced fluorescence and SLO imaging or hyperspectral imaging
Recent studies by
In fact, numerous studies in AD rodent models have detected Aβ and its alloforms such as Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 in the AD retina

Retinal Vascular Aβ Deposits in AD Patients and Animal Models
An early study by
Histological examinations by La
In the
In murine models of AD, a study by the same team demonstrated that following systemic administration of curcumin to APP SWE PS1 E9 model mice, ex vivo examination of retinal flatmounts revealed doublelabeling of curcumin with 4G8 for Aβ deposits inside retinal blood vessels
Amyloidosis in cerebral blood vessels predominately consists of Aβ 40 alloforms
Accordingly,
The pattern that was revealed by Aβ 40 immunoreactivity covered most vascular compartments including tunica media, adventitia, and intima, indicating retinal blood vessels may also be thoroughly affected by Aβ deposition (Figure
Increased levels of Aβ 1-40 peptides in the retina of AD patients as compared with age-and sex-matched cognitively normal controls was further validated by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) analytical biochemistry assay
When correlated with cerebral pathologies, levels of retinal Aβ 40 significantly associated with entorhinal cortex plaque load and had a trend of predicting cognitive decline and CAA.
Retinal vascular Aβ 40 tightly associated with neuritic plaques in the entorhinal cortex and combined cerebral regions including hippocampus, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and parietal cortex.
A study by
Another notable finding was the downregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in AD retina, suggesting compromised Aβ clearance
In a subsequent report,
Another recent study by
It is important to note that the transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model is driven by increased production of human amyloidogenic Aβ peptides, and therefore does not fully represent the human disease.
Nevertheless, this mouse model is known to develop Aβ plaques and intracellular soluble Aβ oligomers, (p)tau, pronounced micro-and astrogliosis, synaptic loss, as well as cognitive and visual decline
Intriguingly, a recent study by
Nevertheless, more supporting evidence and validation is needed to further evaluate the feasibility to diagnose AD by retinal vascular amyloid imaging.

AD-Related Retinal Vasculopathy
Mounting evidence has demonstrated a wide range of retinal vascular abnormalities in both AD patients and animals, such as reduced macular microvascular density
Among these findings, several studies showed significant correlations between retinal vascular impairment and AD susceptibility, while others did not.
Nevertheless, these discoveries have provided numerous potential retinal vascular targets for AD monitoring and diagnosis.
Compared to the brain, a distinct feature of the retina is the existence of Müller glial cells, which are the principal retinal glial cell type that maintain neuronal activity by regulating extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters and neuroactive ions
Indeed, a previously published report suggested that retinal Aβ is engulfed by these specialized Muller glial cells
It is important to note that most investigations are still limited to cross-sectional observations.
Future studies should seek to apply standardized protocols and design with longitudinal study methods.
Another similarity between the retina and brain is the blood-organ barrier: the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) is highly comparable to the BBB, both structurally and functionally
The BBB is composed of cerebral vascular endothelial cells with tight junctions (TJ), astrocyte end-feet and supporting pericytes, while the BRB is made of an inner barrier of retinal vascular endothelial cells and an outer barrier of retinal epithelial cells, both with TJ and supporting pericytes
The main functions of these barriers are to modulate the influx of ions, proteins and water, as well as curb the infiltration of circulating immune cells
In AD, a compromised BBB is viewed as one of the principal causes for cerebral amyloidosis due to its essential role in clearing abundant cerebral Aβ to the circulating blood via the vascular network
Recently, the Zlokovic group has successfully connected the BBB-associated pericyte injury biomarker, soluble PDGFRβ, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to cognitive decline in apolipoprotein E (APOE4) carriers even after controlling for Aβ and tau status
These findings suggest that BBB biomarkers might be an option for next-generation AD diagnostics and therapeutics.
Recent investigation of BRB in MCI and AD patients by
In a subset of patients with neuropathological reports, retinal vascular PDGFRβ expression significantly correlated with CAA and cognitive decline assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
These data suggest that pericyte loss or PDGFRβ downregulation may precede AD progression.
The retinal pericytes in cognitively impaired patients were found to accumulate Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 and undergo apoptosis, demonstrated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and cleaved caspase-3 nuclear staining.
Interestingly, a previous study detected increased neuronal apoptosis in the rat retina induced by intra-vitreous injection of Aβ 1-42 oligomers
In a subsequent study, the Koronyo-Hamaoui group further discovered significantly augmented capillary degeneration in 8-month-old APP SWE PS1 E9 mice compared to wild type littermates that was further exacerbated in 12-monthold mice (Figures
Retinal capillary loss was associated with increased retinal vascular amyloidosis, indicating more BRB damage may be driven by vascular Aβ deposition and implicated in AD pathology
Western blot analysis of whole retinal lysates revealed altered expression of key TJ molecules of the BRB, including claudin-1 and zonula occuludens-1 (ZO-1) (Figures
These changes were also accompanied by elevated NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in retinas of 12-month-old ADtg mice, implicating upregulated inflammation in the retina with increased vascular amyloidosis burden.
Having found these changes in retinal blood vessels and capillaries of AD-model mice, the authors sought to explore how these vascular pathologies may have affected BRB permeability.
In vivo fluorescein (332 Da) imaging of APP SWE PS1 E9 mice showed live retinal vascular leakage in 12-month-old but not in 8-month-old mouse models of AD (Figure
Intriguingly, intravenous injection of larger FITCdextran (1,000 kDa) and Texas-Red-dextran (3 kDa) molecules in 6-month-old APP SWE PS1 E9 mice followed by ex vivo postmortem retinal imaging and quantification of the fluorescent signal indicated a dramatic increase in retinal vascular leakage of both molecules (Figures
These BRB permeability changes in transgenic AD mice occur even earlier than the respective cerebral leakage measured by the same molecules
The difference between in vivo and ex vivo observations is suggestive of a shift in molecular size-dependent transporting mechanisms through the BRB in the AD transgenic mice model.
Accordingly, a recent study utilizing the C57BL/6 mouse revealed a decrease in plasma protein transport activity through the BBB in the aged brain, driven by transport shifting from ligand-specific receptor-mediated to non-specific caveolar transcytosis
Whether this also occurs in AD patients' BRB needs further validation.
Overall, such discoveries have suggested that several BRB compartments are affected in AD disease progression that should be further evaluated as biomarkers for AD diagnosis.

Cerebral Imaging for AD
Recent developments in brain imaging modalities have significantly improved the ability to rule-in AD related cerebral pathologies in at-risk populations
These include MRI (fMRI)
However, these techniques are still subject to a variety of limitations such as high cost, low availability, low spatial resolution, low specificity, or involving the use of unsafe radio isotopes
Nevertheless, current imaging techniques do not provide a solution for large scale screening of pre-symptomatic at-risk populations, which is the main goal of current efforts to develop more sensitive ocular examination techniques for AD diagnosis.

Retinal OCT and OCT-A Imaging in MCI and AD Patients
Optical coherence tomography has been a pioneer technology in capturing retinal structural changes in living AD patients.
This technology utilizes low-coherence light to acquire two-and three-dimensional images of retinal cross-sectional anatomy with micrometer resolution
It provides non-invasive live measurements of retinal layer structure and is widely used in ophthalmic exanimations for diagnosis of glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), as well as other ocular diseases
Subsequently, numerous studies verified these early studies and reported decreases in NFL, ganglion cell layer (GCL), and macula thickness correlating with cognitive decline
OCT-adaptive optics is a relatively newer advancement of this technology which provides ultra-high-resolution images, including of blood vessel walls, that warrants further testing in the AD retina
Among the many advances in OCT technology, OCTangiography (OCTA) has been specifically developed for the investigation of retinal blood vessels, revolutionizing the diagnosis of retinal vascular-related disorders
It provides high-resolution motion-contrast images based on backscattered light from neuronal and vascular tissues in the retina
This enables visualization of various retinal vascular abnormalities such as microaneurysms, neovascularization, retinal vascular non-perfusion, reduced vascular density, and modified foveal avascular zone (FAZ)
OCT-A received FDA approval in 2016 and has been rigorously used in diagnosis of retinal vascular diseases including DR, uveitis, AMD, and others
An early case-control study by
Shortly after,
To date, such OCTA case-controlled studies seem to be largely consistent in demonstrating retinal vascular density loss and increased FAZ area in AD patients but differ in identifying vascular areas affected, the superficial vs. deep, or parafoveal vs. perifoveal vessels
Overall, these are indeed breakthrough findings that warrant further investigation, considering OCTA is a relatively new technology.
It is also important to note that sample sizes in most of these studies are relatively small.
To better evaluate OCTA as a diagnostic tool for AD, longitudinal studies with a standardized consistent protocol and large case numbers are needed.
Blood-retinal barrier permeability in laboratory animals is usually measured by injecting fluorescent dyes such as fluorescein
Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) was developed based on visualizing fluorescent dye by fundus camera that has been widely used to evaluate retinal vascular circulation and BRB integrity
Another modified OCT method, OCT-leakage, was recently developed to monitor retinal edema, thus evaluating BRB damage
This method applies a proprietary algorithm to identify sites of decreased optical reflectivity, then the system quantifies and detects the correlation of retinal extracellular space.
The developer tested OCT-leakage on 28 patients and provided consistent output between FFA and OCT-leakage for BRB damage in diabetic retinopathy
Both FFA and OCT-leakage can potentially be tested in cognitively impaired patients to investigate the potential of BRB permeability monitoring for AD diagnosis.

CONCLUSION
In summary, recent advancements in retinal vascular research in AD patients and animal models have provided many potential candidate targets for non-invasive diagnosis by retinal vascular imaging.
These include but are not limited to retinal vascular amyloidosis, FAZ area, vascular leakage, vascular blood flow and perfusion, TJ alteration, vascular density, pericyte and PDGFRβ loss, vascular branching complexity and others.
Reports suggest that certain vascular abnormalities occur very early during AD progression and may predict cognitive decline in patients; thus, their detection may be critical for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction.
However, since some of these vascular findings are commonly observed in retinal degenerative and inflammatory diseases, it is important to also consider ADspecific hallmark biomarkers such as Aβ and (p)tau for accurate diagnosis.
Finally, with the recent development of retinal amyloid imaging
