Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with the strongest social impact for incidence and cost of care: its debilitating nature leads to enormous financial and emotional stress on patients and caregivers.
AD is the sixth leading cause of death, currently affecting more than 44 million people worldwide.
Its incidence is expected to increase in the next decades due to the increase in the average age of the world population
AD is a multifactorial disorder and the mechanism underlying its pathogenesis is not completely clear yet, although genetic and biochemical clues suggest that dysfunction of the basal acetylcholine (ACh) forebrain signaling
Indeed, recent studies have reported that, during the activation processes, microglia acquires different pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes
M1 phenotype, elicited by β-amyloid protein and τ hyperphosphorylation, becomes relevant at the injury site in the later stage of AD when the neurorepair role of the M2 phenotype is dampened
However, in AD, microglia may also exhibit mixed activation phenotypes
To date, only palliative treatments are available for AD.
The limited effectiveness of current therapies highlights the need for intensifying research efforts devoted to the development of new agents for preventing or slowing down the disease progression.
Management of AD through the modulation of multiple mechanisms rather than a single dysregulated pathway should have a higher chance of success
Therefore, exploring novel potential therapeutic targets appears as an urgent need.

Cannabinoids also have attracted interest in AD because of the beneficial reduction the typical neurotoxic events of the disease
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is generally deemed as a part of the neuroprotective endogenous mechanisms of the central nervous system (CNS) and has been proposed as a target for the treatment of neuroinflammation.
ECS is a complex system of receptors, endogenous ligands, and enzymes catalyzing ligand formation and degradation.
It helps regulating fundamental processes in both central and peripheral nervous systems.
ECS regulation and dysregulation might counteract disturbances of such functions
To date, two subtypes of cannabinoid Gi/o-coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2, have been fully characterized and cloned.
CB1 is mainly present in neurons and glial cells and regulates important brain functions including cognition and memory processes.
Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that CB1 receptor density increases in early AD and decreases during later stages.
Among cannabinoid receptors, the role of CB1 is the most controversial in terms of effects on microglial activation
However, recent evidence has shown that CB1 can promote M1 polarization of monocytes/macrophages during chronic inflammatory processes
Therefore, as for macrophage-like cells, the activation of CB1 could be prodromal of the late microglia M1 phenotype in the progression of AD.
On the other hand, CB2 receptors are localized in immune system cells and modulate their migration and the release of cytokines.
Within the CNS, CB2 receptors are mainly located in microglia, the major immune cells of the brain.
Recent studies have demonstrated selective CB2 upregulation in response to neuroinflammation, as seen during neurodegeneration.
In particular, in AD patients, CB2 are overexpressed in microglia cells surrounding Aβ plaques
Notably, CB2 can reduce neuroinflammation by promoting the M1 to M2 phenotype transformation in microglia

To accomplish multifunctional compounds for the treatment of AD, a promising strategy is the molecular hybridization approach, which allows achieving multitarget-direct ligands (MTDLs) able to hit more than one biological target associated with the disease
Taking this into account, we have previously demonstrated that purposely designed benzofuran derivatives can act as MTDLs towards targets involved in AD
Indeed, the benzofuran scaffold is considered a privileged structure and a very important pharmacophore in drug discovery because of its presence in a great number of natural products and biologically active compounds
Furthermore, the benzofuran derivatives SKF-64346 and LY320135 (Figure
In previous papers we reported different 2-arylbenzofuran hybrid molecules
From this collection, compound 1 (Figure
Furthermore, 1 showed good selectivity and moderate affinity for CB1 receptors
As a follow-up of our previous studies, and aiming at optimizing/improving the biological activities and further exploring the chemical space of the selected targets, here we report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of 2-arylbenzofuran derivatives, based on the structure of lead compound 1 (Figure
At first, the N-methyl-N-benzylamine alkoxy side chain was moved from ring A to ring B and the polymethylene alkoxy spacer was varied to determine its optimal length
This linker chain was also removed, leading to a direct linking of mono or di-alkylated amines to ring B
Finally, taking into account that click chemistry has found increasing applications in drug discovery, this approach was exploited to achieve compound 19, by introducing a substituted triazole.

In summary, a small library of eighteen new derivatives, whose structures are collected in Tables
All compounds were assayed for their biological activities towards selected targets involved in AD, namely human AChE and BuChE, and CB receptors.
After a preliminary screening, the two most promising compounds (8 and 10) were assessed for their neuroprotective activity and for their ability to modulate the microglial phenotype switch from the pro-inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.

Results

Chemistry
According to Scheme 1, 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzofuran underwent Friedel Craft acylation, using acyl chlorides 28-31 in order to obtain compounds 32-35, which were treated with NaI affording the corresponding iodo analogues
The key acyl intermediates 28-31 were prepared via alkylation of the hydroxyl group of the 4hydroxyethyl benzoate in basic conditions with 1-bromo-ω-chloroalkanes in order to obtain 20-23, which via saponification with potassium hydroxide led to compounds 24-27.
These carboxylic acids were then converted into the corresponding acyl chlorides

Cholinesterase inhibition
The evaluation of the inhibitory activity toward human recombinant AChE (hAChE) and BuChE from human serum (hBuChE) was performed according to Ellman's method
d IC50(hAChE) = (2.77
 0.13) M.
n.a.:
= % inhibition not significant (<10%) at the tested concentration.
With respect to the lead compound 1, all the new derivatives lost their hAChE inhibitory activity, while some of them showed an increased inhibition of hBuChE, thus displaying a different selectivity profile.
In particular, in the first series (2-5, Table
Moreover, a correlation between potency and side chain length was observed, being the two-and five-methylene linkers (compounds 2 and 5) considerably more favorable than three or four (compounds 3 and 4).
In the second series (6-19, Table
Noteworthy, these four compounds exhibited higher potency with respect to the lead compound 1, which showed balanced, albeit low, potency on both cholinesterases.
Due to their weak potency, clear structure-activity relationships (SARs) cannot be drawn for this subset of derivatives.

CB1 and CB2 receptors affinity
The binding affinities of compounds 2-19 at human recombinant CB1 and CB2 receptors were determined by a competition assay using a high affinity ligand, i.e. [

When citing, please refer to the published version.
In the first series (compounds 2-5, Table
In particular, the affinity for the CB1 receptor decreased with the increase of the linker length (compounds 2-5); furthermore, while 1 was CB1-selective, the new hybrids bearing the shorter linker chain (2-or 3-methylene units linker, derivatives 2 and 3, respectively) showed a slightly higher affinity for CB2 receptors, while compounds 4 and 5, bearing a longer spacer chain, were CB1-selective.
Thus, a proper chain length seems to be a relevant feature for the modulation of both activity and selectivity.
In this respect, compound 3 showed the highest potency and selectivity (4-fold) towards CB2.
Removal of the spacer chain, with the direct linking of alkylated amines to ring B, led to improved affinity for the CB2 receptor, which seemed to be favorably modulated by the aryl substituent.
Indeed, the introduction of a fluorine atom in para position induced a 10-fold increase in the potency (8 vs 6, Ki = 20 nM and 170 nM, respectively).
A similar behavior was observed with the introduction of a CN group
The bioisosteric substitution of the benzene with a pyridine (13) reduced potency by an order of magnitude, while the cyclopropyl analogue 16 was equipotent to 6.
With the substitution of the benzene ring with a heptamethylene alkyl chain, as in compound 18, a 2.5-fold decrease in potency was observed.
Conversely, a shorter pentamethylene chain (17) led to a 2.5-fold increase in activity.
Di-alkylated amines bound to B ring showed a loss of potency
Noteworthy, the introduction of a small methyl group on compound 8, allowed achieving the most potent compound of the series (10, Ki = 2.7 nM, 600 folds more active than SR144528).
This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (

When citing, please refer to the published version.
In the second series, appreciable CB1 affinity in the nanomolar range was observed for derivatives 8, 10, 14, 16-18.
The introduction of a F (8) or a CN
The introduction of a cyclopropyl
Once again, the most potent compound in this series was the methyl di-alkylated 10 (Ki = 20 nM), which proved to be a potent ligand for both receptors, with a selectivity index (SI) towards CB2 of 7.4.
In this respect, the removal of a methyl group yielding the mono-alkylated 8, led to increased selectivity up to 39 folds (CB2 over CB1).
Nevertheless, the most selective compound of the series was 14, again a mono alkylated derivative, bearing a CN group on the benzene ring.
Compound 14 showed a SI of two orders of magnitude (SI = 130) towards CB2.
The length of the side chain also affected selectivity:
the presence of a 5-unit chain led to a comparable potency at both receptors (17, Ki = 80 and 70 nM), while a 7-methylene chain allowed to better discriminate between the two receptor subtypes, i.e. derivative 18 showed a 4-fold higher affinity for CB2.
Finally, compound 19, bearing a substituted triazole, was inactive at both CB1 and CB2 receptors.
The most potent CB2 ligand 10 was further evaluated to assess its capability of activating CB2
receptor in a functional assay.
A cAMP Hunter™ assay using an enzyme fragment complementation chemiluminescent detection kit was performed to assess whether compound 10 could modulate intracellular cAMP levels in NKH-477-stimulated CHO cells overexpressing the human recombinant CB2 receptor.
In the selected assay conditions, 10 induced an increase of cAMP levels following stimulation with NKH-477 (a water-soluble analogue of forskolin), suggesting an inverse agonist behavior (Figure

maximal and minimal response observed considering the NKH-477 stimulus alone as 100% of the response.
To confirm this hypothesis, 10 was tested in the presence of a previously determined EC80 CB2agonist challenge (JWH133, 4µM).
Accordingly, we found that 10 dose-dependently displaced the challenge of JHW133 and increased cAMP levels following the NKH-477 stimulus (Figure

Neuroprotective activity
The cytotoxicity of compounds 8 and 10 was evaluated in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using the MTT assay.
After 24 h of treatment with different concentrations of compounds 8 or 10
(1.25 -40 µM) residual cell viability was assessed.
Data showed that concentrations up to 5 µM of both derivatives did not affect neuronal cell viability (data not shown).
Therefore, we selected a

range of not cytotoxic concentrations (0.625 -5 µM) to investigate the neuroprotective activity of compounds 8 and 10 against Aβ1-42 oligomer (OAβ1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.
The neuroprotective activity was evaluated after 4 h of treatment with OAβ1-42 (10 µM) in the presence of compounds 8 or 10 using the MTT formazan exocytosis assay.
Only the treatment with compound 8 significantly counteracted, in a dose-dependent manner, the neurotoxicity induced by OAβ1-42 (Figure

Activation of Microglia
The possible immunomodulatory effects of compounds 8, 10 and of the lead 1 were evaluated by analyzing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is widely considered a This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (

After treatment with compounds 8 and 10, reduction of the M1 marker iNOS was observed with a maximum effect at 5 µM (inhibition: 83% for compound 8; 60% for compound 10), with no concomitant decrease in TREM2 expression (Figure
This suggests an immunomodulatory effect for both compounds.
Regarding the lead compound 1, a toxic effect was observed at the lowest assayed concentration (5 µM).

Molecular docking studies

Finally, being compound 8 also endowed with a significant hBuChE inhibitory activity, a molecular docking simulation was performed using Autodock Vina software
We applied docking studies based on the available crystal structure of the hBuChE complexed with tacrine (PDB ID: 4BDS) with a grid box of sufficient size to cover whole protein for docking.
The docking simulation of 8 discloses that this compound can be efficiently accommodated inside the active site gorge with a molecular docking score of -10.7 kcal/mol (Figure
Threedimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) representations of the most energetically profitable pose of compound 8 docked into the active site of BuChE were given in Figures
The complex of protein with the best-docked pose of inhibitor showed that the benzofuran moiety is located at the entrance of the active-site gorge with both side chains oriented deep inside the gorge.
The phenyl ring aromaticity clearly plays a dominant role in stabilizing inhibitor binding.
The p-Fbenzyl moiety is oriented toward the bottom of the active site and it binds in the CAS region of the enzyme establishing strong ᴫ-ᴫ stacking interactions with Trp82 and His438 of the catalytic-triad.
The methoxy-phenyl ring forms ᴫ-ᴫ T-shaped interactions with Phe329 in the acyl-binding pocket of the enzyme.
The amino-phenyl ring forms ᴫ-ᴫ stacking interaction with Tyr332 of the PAS.
Apart from these ᴫ-ᴫ interactions, a hydrogen bond was established between the oxygen atom of the methoxy group and the hydroxyl group of Ser198 of the catalytic triad.
Notably, the F atom in the phenyl ring interacted with amino acids to form halogen interactions.
F atom held Gly115 and Glu197 at one binding site resulting in the presence of F

These noncovalent interactions were fairly strong, with the bond distances being around 3.60 Å.

Discussion
In this paper the potential multitarget profile of two series of benzofuran derivatives, focused on the structure of the previously reported lead compound 1, was assessed.
From the results, some considerations can be drawn.
In the first series (compounds 2-5), moving the side chain from A to B ring allowed achieving selectivity towards hBuChE, while affinity for the two cannabinoid receptors was modulated by the length of the linker.
In particular, compound 5, with a 5-methylene chain, showed a balanced effect on the two targets, with a good inhibitory activity on hBuChE and appreciable affinity and selectivity for CB1 receptors.
This finding is of particular interest since BuChE has recently gained a renewed interest as a therapeutic target in AD, since changes in its activity along disease progression were highlighted.
Indeed, the brain levels of BuChE are un-altered or progressively increased during AD progression, while AChE activity declines
On the other hand, CB1
antagonists caused improvement in memory in several preclinical models of cognitive impairment
In the second series (6-18), the linker chain was removed, leading to a direct binding of mono or dialkylated amines to B ring.
Again, from a multitarget point of view, derivatives 8, 9 and 17 emerged as good hBuChE inhibitors and CB receptors ligands.
In particular, compound 9 was endowed with a peculiar selectivity for CB2 receptors.
Notably, derivatives 8 (p-F-benzyl alkylated) and 9 (bis-p-F-benzyl alkylated) contain fluorine atoms.
Organofluorine compounds have recently been claimed as one of the most promising class of drug candidates in medicinal chemistry

fluorine and fluoro-functional groups can be of crucial importance in affecting potency and pharmacokinetic properties of bioactive compounds, as the unique nature of fluorine strongly impacts on the chemical properties of the products
On the other hand, 17 contains a n-pentyl alkyl chain, able to mimic the side chain of classical natural and synthetic cannabinoid ligands.
Aiming at evaluating the possible involvement of CB2 receptor in neuroinflammation, compound 8,
showing affinity for both receptors, although with a preference for CB2 receptor (SI = 39), and 10, endowed with the highest CB2 binding affinity (Ki = 2.7 nM) were selected for further studies.
First of all, the most potent CB2 ligand
Under the functional assay conditions, this compound induced an increase of cAMP levels, suggesting an inverse agonist behavior.
The compounds were then evaluated to establish their neuroprotective activity against OAβ1-42induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.
Inflammation, indeed, represents a consistent feature in AD brain, and mounting evidence suggests that a neuroinflammatory response may be implicated in disease development.
Insoluble deposits of Aβ are strong candidates for initiating the inflammatory response, whereas activated microglia and astrocytes could trigger a self-propagating neuroinflammatory process resulting in brain damage.
Treatment with compound 8 significantly counteracted, in a dose-dependent manner, the OAβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity while 10 was inactive.
Recent studies have reported that both CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed in SH-SY5Y cells, but have also highlighted the lack of a functional role for CB receptor agonists in response to Aβ exposure in these cells
Therefore, the neuroprotective activity exerted by 8 may be due to its putative mode of action, i.e., inverse agonist at CB2 receptor, a property for which this compound proved to be 39 folds more selective than the inactive derivative 10.
However, it cannot be excluded at this stage that the neuroprotective activity of 8 could also result from a direct, non-This item was downloaded from IRIS Università di Bologna (

CB receptor-mediated, action on Aβ peptide.
In this regard, we have previously demonstrated that the benzoyl group of compound 1 is crucial
Indeed, the neuroprotective effects of benzofuran derivative 8, but not 10, carrying an additional secondary amino group, may be related to its ability to form further donor hydrogen bonds with the same amino acid residues of Aβ peptide.
Microglial cells represent the main immune cells of the brain and are widely considered a promising target to counteract neuroinflammatory diseases, including AD.
In physiological conditions, they constantly survey the parenchyma, while in neuropathological conditions they become activated, and play different roles depending on the duration and the gravity of the insult.
Indeed, at an early stage of the disease, in order to protect neurons and fight the pathology, microglia acquire a M2 phenotype; later, when the disease progresses and expands, a M1 phenotype develops, and these cells become neurotoxic, producing proinflammatory cytokines, and leading to neuroinflammation.
For these reasons, immunomodulation, i.e. the shift of microglial cells from the neurotoxic M1 to neuroprotective M2 phenotype, is now widely considered a promising therapeutic approach to tackle neurodegenerative diseases, including AD
Accumulating evidence indicates that cannabinoids can modulate the function of activated microglia and the release of cytotoxic factors
It has been also shown that both CB receptors are expressed in microglia and astrocytes.
Unlike the CB1 receptor, which is constitutively expressed in microglia, the expression of CB2 receptor is inducible and is modulated in response to the activation stage of microglia.
In particular, CB₂ receptor levels undergo time-dependent changes during microglia activation, with the initial attempt to counteract inflammation

Although much of the literature dealing with CB2 immunomodulatory effects focuses on agonists
CB2 agonists have raised great interest as candidates for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative disorders.
By contrast, CB2 antagonists/inverse agonists have been shown to be promising agents for immunomodulation therapies.
Experimental studies have documented beneficial effects of the administration of CB2 antagonists/inverse agonists in animal models of various inflammatory disorders, arthritic bone damage and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
Indeed, recent studies showed that CB1 and CB2
receptor antagonists can directly suppress iNOS induction and ROS generation in activated microglia, leading to a feasible neuroprotective outcome
Moreover, the beneficial effect of SMM-189, a potent and selective CB2 inverse agonist, in a mild traumatic brain injury model, suggested a possible anti-inflammatory activity, due to its ability of reducing the M1 and increasing the M2 phenotype of human and murine microglia in vitro
Again, studies on the triaryl bissulphone, Sch.414319, also led to speculate that inverse agonists to the CB2 receptor may serve as immune modulators
Here we observed that compounds 8 and 10 were able to strongly reduce iNOS expression (an M1 marker) induced by LPS treatment, without changing TREM2 expression (an M2 marker).
This indicates an immunomodulatory effect of both compounds even at low concentrations (5μM).
Notably, in the same experimental conditions, the lead compound 1, a selective CB1 ligand, was cytotoxic and induced cell death even at the lowest tested concentration, endorsing a potential key role of CB2 receptors in immunomodulation.

CB2 receptor functional activity



. Chemistry 4.1.1. Chemistry. General Methods.
conclusion, compound 8 can face AD from several directions: it restores the cholinergic system by inhibiting BuChE, exerts a neuroprotective activity against Aβ1-42 oligomers and is a potent CB receptor ligand, with 39-fold selectivity for CB2.Compound 8 is able to exert an interesting action by combining anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.In addition, since pro-inflammatory M1 microglia predominate in the advanced stage of AD and aggravate disease progression, compound 8 by interfering with the activation of M1, could be effective in halting lesion development.Derivative 10 proved to be a potent CB2 inverse agonist with promising immunomodulatory properties.
Being the development of CB2 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists still very limited, a clear estimation of the therapeutic impact of such a class of ligands must await initial clinical testing and data in humans.
Indeed, the mechanisms whereby CB2 modulation affects inflammation and immune cell function are complex and detailed pathways remain to be elucidated.
CB2 receptor antagonists are, therefore, useful tools for studying signaling pathways associated with CB2 binding.
