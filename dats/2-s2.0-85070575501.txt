Entanglement of CCR5 and Alzheimer’s Disease
Although the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease are diverse and unclear, the past 20 years have witnessed the unprecedented development of the AD inflammation theory.
As a key inflammatory receptor family, the C-C chemokine receptor family is a remarkable participant in the cause of Alzheimer's disease; of this family, CCR5 is the most widely studied.
CCR5 is an essential entrance when HIV infects immune cells and is also involved in other inflammatory and immune activities.
New evidence on the inevitably intertwined link between Alzheimer's disease and CCR5 indicates that CCR5 accelerates the development of Alzheimer's disease, and few studies disputed it.
The role of CCR5 in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive.
However, as the research progresses, this intricate relationship will gradually be uncovered.

INTRODUCTION
C-C chemokine receptors 5 (CCR5) is a kind of cytokine belonging to the β chemokine receptor family of integral membrane proteins
CCR5 is well known (or notorious) mainly because it collaborates with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) when the virus enters target immunological cells
Intriguingly, most current anti-HIV drugs target CCR5.
At the end of the 2018, the announcement of Chinese gene edited infants whose CCR5 genes were deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 again brought the debate about CCR5 to the forefront.
Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by typical pathological changes such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder.
With the aging of the population, the battle with AD will become more difficult.
Although the causes and pathogenetic mechanisms remain uncertain, there is growing evidence linking neuroinflammation with AD
Numerous cytokines, e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
Additionally, many variants in immune genes such as TREM2, CD33 and CR1 were recognized by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as genetic risk factors for AD
Our receptor of interest, the chemokine receptor, is involved in substantial inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and functions in the recruitment and immigration of immune cells.
These receptors are mainly distributed in microglia and recruited peripheral blood monocytes in the CNS
Increased expression of CCR5 in the CNS is an inflammatory response to many neuropathological diseases, e.g., stroke
At the beginning of this year, an article published in Cell
In this review, we will elucidate the intricate association between AD, inflammation, and CCR5.

AD AND NEUROINFLAMMATION

Pathogenesis of AD
As the most common cause of dementia, AD is still defined by the combined presence of amyloid and tau; thus, countless studies are conducted with the aim of discerning the enigma of these two pathological factors.
However, all current drug clinical trials for amyloid or tau have ended in failure.
Researchers are gradually moving away from the simple estimation of linear connection as proposed in the initial amyloid hypothesis
Several lines of evidence confirmed that vascular damage increased the risk of later cognitive impairment and finally dementia
Additionally, there are considerable disease and lifestyle determinants that could result in increased susceptibility to developing AD, e.g., traumatic brain injury, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, education, exercise, and psychological factors, except for the proverbial aging and risk genetic allele
Notably, most of these factors are relevant to inflammation and immunity.
Consequently, a variety of hypotheses and theories of AD have been proposed, among which the inflammation hypothesis is receiving growing support
Although the reviews of neuroinflammation and AD are abundant and comprehensive (for more detail, we recommend Ref;

Microglia as a Double-Edged Sword
Notwithstanding existing evidence indicating that peripheral immune cells can infiltrate brain tissue through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB) under pathological conditions and cause inflammation
Unlike neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, microglia are considered resident immune cells from the mesoderm and function in some housekeeping work, including neurogenesis, the trimming and stimulation of synapses, the modulation of cognitive processes, and immunological surveillance.
Gradual deterioration of the immune system increases vulnerability to infections and diseases as individuals age.
Some altered expression of microgliarelated genes that could accelerate the progression of AD has been identified in AD patients
Microglia isolated from postmortem aging brains also showed significant transcriptome characteristics compared with those obtained from younger brains; genes associated with celladhesion axon-guided cell surface receptor expression and actin assembly were specifically affected
Moreover, microglial cells from the aged cortex show many morphological abnormalities, including the formation of nodal processes and division processes of acellular globules
The proteins that microglia produce exhibit dramatic changes during aging, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation.
For example, secreted cytokines, displayed membrane proteins, and energy and metabolism protein needs differ drastically
However, the complex relationship between microglia, tau, and amyloid beta protein (Aβ) remains controversial.
On the one hand, many studies have indicated that microglia are capable of congregating around Aβ and phagocytosing it to attenuate the pathological load.
On the other hand, activated microglia could damage neurons and vascular epithelial cells, which lead to additional impairment of cognitive function
The distinct subtypes of microglia contribute to the AD course in a diverse manner, and the heterogeneity of pro-and anti-inflammatory timing of microglia is a formidable obstacle
Reactive microglia can accelerate the propagation of tau pathology, thereby causing a deterioration in inflammation
Deposition of Aβ worsens neurodegeneration and triggers pro-inflammatory responses.
Moreover, Aβ binds to inflammatory receptors
When microglia and astrocytes clear Aβ through phagocytosis and intracellular degradation, many transmembrane receptors (e.g., LRP-1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter family) bind to Aβ, and most of these receptors are essential in immune and inflammatory responses

Molecular Receptor Spectrum of Neuroinflammation
The theoretical framework regarding how inflammation interacts with the development of AD has been widened and explored on an unprecedented scale.
Internationally renowned pharmaceutical companies have already started multiple clinical drug trials on the anti-inflammatory treatment of AD
Despite cellular components (e.g., microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells), an increasing number of receptors, membrane proteins and metabolic enzymes have become candidates for further research and clinical trials.
For example, positive modulation of a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (a7nAChRs) had therapeutic potential for its anti-inflammatory effects
The lower dose of colonystimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors led to increased hippocampal-dependent spatial memory
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) were considered a neuroprotective candidate against early damage factors to neurons, astrocytes, microglia, cerebrovascular endothelial, and BBB; consequently, ARBs prevent cognitive loss and dementia
Mimetics of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, first designed to treat diabetes, were capable of reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic signaling and protecting memory formation
In addition to membrane receptors, a substantial number of studies revealed that nuclear receptors could be potential interventional targets to suspend dementia progression in AD
Notably, numerous studies have focused on various inflammatory receptors and diverse signaling pathways.
Among these components, chemokine receptors, which are mainly studied in immunology, deserve further attention.
The birth of Chinese gene edited infants has greatly enriched scientific theories because some studies showed that CCR5 deficiency could improve both prognosis and neuronal plasticity after stroke and traumatic injury, which encouraged an unprecedented CCR5 research boom

CCR5 CCR5: Structure, Distribution, and Function
CCR5 belongs to the seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that transmit signals via heterotrimeric G proteins
CCR5 consists of 7 hydrophobic transmembrane domains with an extracellular N-terminus and cytoplasmic C-terminus, ranging in length from 340 to 370 amino acids
CCR5 is the receptor for nearly 10 chemotactic proteins of the β chemokine family, which are also named CC chemokines
In humans, the gene encoding the CCR5 protein is situated in the short (p) arm at position 21 on chromosome 3.
In the immune system, CCR5 widely resides on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells), effector lymphocytes and regulatory T cells
The corresponding ligands are presented on effector T cells and natural killer cells
CCR5 regulates chemotaxis and cell activation through interactions with MIP-1α (CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), RANTES (CCL5), MCP-2 (CCL8), CCL11 (eotaxin), HCC-1 (CCL14a), and HCC-4 (CCL16)
CCR5 is widely known because it provides access for HIV-1 to invade host immune cells.
The gp120 envelope protein is a chemokine mimic; thus, it can bind to CCR5 during HIV infection
Additionally, CCR5 can accelerate the transmission of the R5-strain of the HIV-1 virus
CCR 32 is a 32-base-pair deletion that inserts a premature stop codon into the CCR5 receptor locus, leading to receptor dysfunction.
Homozygous carriers of this mutation cannot be infected with M-tropics strains of HIV-1
Several lines of cancer cells (e.g., breast and prostate cancer cells), instead of normal epithelial cells, express a high level of CCR5, which help the cancer transformation process
Furthermore, the chemotherapy resistance of cancer stem cells could be partly accredited to the expression of CCR5
In the CNS, these receptors are produced by microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells (normally undetectable on neurons)
All existing evidence suggests that CCR5 participates in neuroinflammation and neuroimmunology, including microglial activation
Under the same conditions, neuronal death was more notable in the brains of CCR5-/-mice than in those of CCR5+/+ mice
Knockout of the CCR5 gene was associated with the inadequate development and maturation of dopaminergic neurons

CCR5: Signal Pathway
CCR5 activates the cellular signaling pathway through G proteins, pertussis-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins and G protein-independent pathways
The binding of a chemokine ligand to CCR5 results in conformational changes in G proteins, which will enable various signaling cascades, including those of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), as well as calcium influx
At present, G-protein-independent signaling pathways involving the Janus kinases (JAK), pyk2 kinase, and arrestin pathways have been identified
These cascades activate various cellular functions, cytoskeleton recombination, and chemotaxis.
Calcium flux is an essential procedure for sequent signal activation in the CNS.
Given that various types of cells express CCR5, it is not impossible that its diverse biological effects require more than G-proteininitiated pathways.
The different chemokine ligands that CCR5 binds to determine distinct signaling pathways accounting for the pleiotropic effects of chemokine signaling
Additionally, blockage of CCR5 signaling could not only lead to rejection of HIV but also elicit neuroprotective mechanisms and promote neuron survival, which will alleviate HIV-associated dementia

The Efficacy of CCR5 Antagonists
The promising development of CCR5 receptor inhibitors is largely based on CCR5's identity as a necessary pathway for AIDS infection.
The only first-generation CCR5 antagonist that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, Maraviroc, was well tolerated and showed excellent repression of viral load in patients whose highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) failed but not in treatment-naïve patients
The high efficacy of maraviroc has set the tone for second-generation CCR5 antagonists, which account for the failures of aplaviroc and vicriviroc in clinical trials
Various modified and innovative second-generation CCR5 antagonists [e.g., piperidine amide compounds
However, more data have revealed that CCR5 antagonists function in other disease courses.
Dual CCR5/CCR2 antagonists and cenicriviroc could inhibit the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
In addition, cenicriviroc could reduce liver injury in cholestatic rodents
Moreover, the inhibition of lymphocyte migration caused by CCR5 blockade could alleviate graft-versus-host disease
Could the CCR5 blockade provide relief from AD?

AD AND CCR5
The definite relationship between AD and CCR5 remains an open debate.
Disputable results from basic experimental studies have diverged into two opposed groups.
Most of studies demonstrated that the expression of CCR5 contributes to the development of AD (Table
However, all existing epidemiologic studies confirmed that there was no  association between the CCR5 32 allele and AD risk.
Therefore, the entanglement of AD and CCR5 urgently needs to be addressed (Table
The Major Group: CCR5 Exacerbates AD (Table
Memory, learning and plasticity processes in hippocampal and cortical circuits involve electrochemical activity of neurons, including long-term potentiation (LTP), release of glutamate, activation of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, and the generation of new dendritic spines and axons.
Consequently, LTP and hippocampus-dependent memory significantly improved, while neuronal CCR5 overaction led to memory deficits
This cornerstone study underlies the foundation of the relationship between memory and CCR5, which also implies a potential discoverable link between CCR5 and AD.
The increase in both CCR5 and CCR3 on some reactive microglia was found in AD patients and associated with amyloid deposition
After the administration of Aβ into the lateral ventricle of CCR5-/mice, the activation of microglia and astrocytes was decreased compared with that in CCR5 wild-type mice
CCR5-/-mice showed decreased astrocytosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus after Aβ injection, which resulted from decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase, as well as reduced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein
In humans, there were more widespread reactive astrocytes with CCR5 expression in AD than in healthy
In addition, the impairment of memory and synaptic dysfunction caused by Aβ were alleviated in CCR5-/-mice
Similarly, both knockout of the CCR5 gene and administration of maraviroc (FDA-approved anti-HIV drug) could heighten plasticity in the premotor cortex proximal to the stroke site and upregulate CREB and DLK signaling in neurons, which finally aided in the formation of new connections in the contralateral premotor cortex
Although this conspicuous study did not connect CCR5 with AD, it suggested that CCR5 and its signaling pathways had a pivotal impact on the generation and regeneration of dendritic spines and synapses.
Peripheral blood immune cells can filter into the CNS with the help of  CCR5
CCL3 and CCL4, as ligands for CCR5, were upregulated in microglia isolated from AD patient brains and stimulated with Aβ
In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) analysis suggested that the expression of both CCR5 and CCR2 were augmented in AD patients compared with those in control subjects
Further experiments suggested that acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACEI) was capable of decreasing the expression of CCR5 and CCR2 in the PBMCs of AD patients, in vitro administration of Aβ increased their expression in PBMCs
Similar results were also obtained by
A CCR5 antagonist could reduce the number of active astrocytes and microglia after lipopolysaccharide injection, which implied that CCR5 was involved in neuroinflammation related to AD
As mentioned above, CCR5 is involved in neuroinflammation, wherein various CCR5 antagonists can attenuate the neuroinflammation associated with AD.
D-Ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA), a kind of CCR5 antagonist of monocyte chemotaxis, was shown to reduce chronic neuroinflammation by blocking the release of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1
After the administration of Egr-1 siRNA, Aβ-associated CCR5 expression and its concomitant ligands decreased significantly
Curcumin also inhibited the Aβ-associated expression of CCR5 by preventing Egr-1 DNA binding to the promoter of CCR5
The Minor Group: CCR5 Improves AD (Table
Additionally,
Lipopolysaccharide injection of CCR5 knockout mice significantly increased astrogliosis and Aβ deposition compared with those in CCR5 wild-type mice
Within the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of Tau-P201L mice, which is another frequently used model for AD, CCR5 gene expression was significantly reduced over time compared with that in wild-type mice, while no distinction was found between other brain regions
CCR5-/-mice showed a higher level of Aβ, which was related to astrocyte activation and CCR2 overexpression.
These changes finally caused memory impairments
No Epidemiological Link Between AD and CCR5 (Table
Several epidemiological studies confirmed that there was no differential distribution of the CCR 32 deletion in AD patients and controls in Italy
Moreover, no differences were observed by gender stratification, by the presence of the ApoE q4 allele, or by the age at onset in genotype distribution and allelic frequency
Identical results were found in Spanish and Iran: the CCR5 32 allele was not a correlative factor for AD

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
The definite mechanism of AD remains unclear, but our understanding of AD has far exceeded the two typical pathological manifestations-Aβ and tau.
The neuroinflammation theory of AD is fascinating an increasing number of researchers.
Currently, more than 5000 studies about AD and neuroinflammation are available on PubMed, and the number is expanding.
CCR5 expression was strongly related to microglia and inflammation, which validated an inseparable relationship between inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, and CCR5
As the most notable receptor among the chemokine receptor family, the accurate function and subsequent signaling pathways of CCR5 have been well studied.
Available epidemiological evidence could provide no connection between the CCR5 32 gene and AD
However, given that all of the epidemiological evidence was based on genotype and performed more than a decade ago, potential links may lie deeper than the superficial genotype, such as translational modulation, proteomics, and epigenetics.
Despite the controversy, it cannot be denied that CCR5 plays an important role in the process of LTP, cortical plasticity, learning and memory
We posited that the reason for experimental conflicts between CCR5 and AD are as follows: the animal models and the methods the authors used for acquiring AD models were varied.
Furthermore, compared with administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA), maraviroc and other antagonists, the effect of total knockout of the CCR5 gene could lead to an enormous impact on cellular signal pathways inside the membrane.
Further investigation should take these factors into account.
Future studies of molecular mechanisms of subsequent intracellular signal pathways caused by CCR5 activation would shed new light on this entanglement between AD and CCR5.
