Brain Derived Exosomes Are a Double-Edged Sword in Alzheimer’s Disease
Brain derived exosomes (BDEs) are extracellular nanovesicles that are collectively released by all cell lineages of the central nervous system and contain cargo from their original cells.
They are emerging as key mediators of communication and waste management among neurons, glial cells and connective tissue during both physiological and pathological conditions in the brain.
We review the rapidly growing frontier of BDEs biology in recent years including the involvement of exosomes in neuronal development, maintenance and communication through their multiple signaling functions.
Particularly, we highlight the important role of exosomes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), both as a pathogenic agent and as a disease biomarker.
Our understanding of such unique nanovesicles may offer not only answers about the (patho) physiological course in AD and associated neurodegenerative diseases but also ideal methods to develop these vesicles as vehicles for drug delivery or as tools to monitor brain diseases in a noninvasive manner because crossing the blood brain barrier is an inherent capability of exosomes.
BDEs have potential as biomarkers and as therapeutic tools for AD and related brain disorders in the near future.

INTRODUCTION
Exosomes are small extracellular nano-sized vesicles between 30 and 150 nm in diameter (DeLeo and Ikezu, 2018) that were first described in the 1980s
They consist of one type of EVs and are categorized on the basis of their biogenesis pathways
Since then, exosomes have been isolated from nearly all mammalian cell types, including cells in the CNS such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells, as well as endothelial cells
Exosomes released from the nervous system are collectively called BDEs.
To form MVBs with ILVs, early endosomes undergo inward budding
Then, ILVs are released into the extracellular environment as exosomes via fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane
Alternatively, exosomal formation can be regulated by sphingolipids, ceramides and tetraspanins
Otherwise, MVBs can fuse with the lysosomal membrane, resulting in degradation of ILVs and recycling of their content
As a result of their origin and multifarious molecular cargo, including but not limited to gDNA, mRNA, other non-coding RNAs, lipids and proteins
Exosomes can randomly or selectively exhibit great variety depending on their membranes, cytosolic proteins, and nucleic acids compared with the cells that release them.
Based on the proteomic and other comprehensive analyses, the heterogeneity of exosomes is conceptualized on the basis of their size, content (cargo), functional impact on recipient cells and cell of origin (source)
It is becoming increasingly clear that exosomes have specialized functions and play a key role in coagulation, intercellular signaling and waste management
During the formation process, exosomes are comprised of enriched endosome-associated components such as flotillins and annexins
Moreover, membrane proteins, including tetraspanins such as abundant CD9, CD63, and CD81, that are considered as markers for exosomes and play important roles in the biogenesis of endosomes or MVBs
Depending on the cell type from which they are secreted, exosome vesicles themselves also hold particular and varied types of markers that contribute to identifying their origins
For example, neuronal L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) can be used as a biomarker for isolating BDEs
Once the exosomes are secreted, they can be internalized from the extracellular space by recipient cells through several mechanisms including phagocytosis, micropinocytosis, endocytosis, and plasma membrane fusion
On the other hand, exosomes carrying multiple cargo with valuable biological information can also be released into most bodily fluids such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, colostrum, breast milk, synovial fluid, semen and pleural ascites, not only in normal tissues
For the above reasons, exosomes play key roles in the management of normal physiological environments, such as immune surveillance
Given the characteristic described above, exosomes and their constituents represent a novel class of therapeutic targets and such features also give them advantages as biomarkers to distinguish healthy and disease states
Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes may also be directly considered as potential therapeutic agents.
For instance, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been used in tissue regeneration
Remarkably, exosomes have an efficient capability to cross the BBB
In particular, exosomes isolated from CSF are rich in proteins that originate from the brain such as neuron-specific markers, microglial markers (CD11b and CD45) and Apo-E
Here, we mainly discuss and summarize the role of BDEs in normal biological processes in the CNS as well as the aberrant pathological state of AD and focus on explaining how exosomes can be targeted or directly exploited as biomarkers or therapeutics in AD.

PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF BDEs IN THE CNS
Exosomes exert their effects on essential biological processes throughout the body including the CNS by different mechanisms.
These mechanisms include cell surface receptors activation through direct binding to lipid ligands and proteins, exosomal membrane fusion contents with the recipient cell plasma membrane and effectors delivery.
Some of these effectors are oncogenes, transcription factors, small and large non-coding regulatory RNAs (such as miRNAs) and mRNAs, as well as infectious particles such as amyloid-β (Aβ)-derived
In this manner, exosomes participate in the maintenance of normal physiology (Figure
Particularly, in the CNS, exosomes can be released from virtually all cell types, including various types of neurons,
Cargo sorting into exosomes involves the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent mechanism, which are managed by ESCRT proteins (ESCRT-0, I, II, and III) and their accessories (ALIX, TSG101, and VPS32)
ILVs have two fates, either fusing with the lysosome resulting in the degradation of the ILVs and their contents for recycling as an endolysosomal pathway
Microvesicles are formed directly by outward budding of the plasma membrane, a course which is managed by the ESCRT components and ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), some small GTPases, lipids, and Ca 2+ -dependent enzymatic machineries
Apoptotic bodies are the largest of the EVs.
They "bleb" off the cell membrane and contain material from cells undergoing apoptosis, which are typically engulfed by macrophages
After release into the extracellular space, exosomes can be internalized by recipient cells mediated by the interaction of various exosomal surface proteins and cellular receptors via several mechanisms including phagocytosis, plasma membrane fusion, macropinocytosis and endocytosis
The contents of exosomes can effectively influence cellular processes through taking part in genetic/protein transfer, transcriptional regulation or post-transcriptional regulation.
Alternatively, exosomes can be further fused with the lysosomes for degradation
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells, as well as endothelial cells
EVs carry and release multiple molecules related to neuronal function and neurotransmission in the brain, which is beneficial for the reciprocal communication between neural cells (e.g., neuron-glia interactions), synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and neuroimmune communication

Neuron-Glia Communication via Exosome Secretion
Neurons and glial cells (a class of cells that mainly includes microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) orchestrate CNS homeostasis via numerous mechanisms of intercellular communication.
Exosomes might regulate the physiological condition of the recipient cells and interactions between various neural cells.
For example, upon activation of glutamatergic synapses, cortical neuron-derived exosomes are selectively delivered to neurons but not glial cells
Recent studies using CD63-GFP positive intraluminal vesicles as exosomal reporter in mice have demonstrated that exosomes participate in mediating neuron to astroglia communication in the CNS
Furthermore, miRNAs (especially miR-124a) in exosomes isolated from neuron-conditioned medium possess excitatory amino acid transporter 2, a necessary mediator of glutamate uptake via the internalization of exosomes into astrocytes
However, exosomes also participate in reciprocal oligodendrocyte-neuron communication and transfer cargo from oligodendrocytes to neurons
Although exosome-mediated communication and the manner by which exosomes select their recipient cells are largely unclear, emerging evidence suggests that exosomes serve as selectively important conveyers for neuronneuron or neuron-glia interaction in the brain by transmitting genetic information, various bioactive proteins, and lipids.
They afford positive as well as negative effect on the neurons depending on the cargo they carry.
In the physiological condition, exosomes benefit to the reciprocal communication between neural cells (e.g., neuron-glia interaction), synaptic plasticity, neuronal development and neuroimmune communication.
In the early stage of AD, the microglia activation by Aβ has neuroprotective effect because it induces phagocytosis and Aβ clearance
The microglia stimulation by astrocyte released ATP induces the secretion of exosomes including P2X7 receptor as a defensive strategy (Continued) FIGURE 2 | Continued to escape astrocyte signaling
In the latter stage of AD, microglia secrete exosomes containing pro-IL1β, active caspase-1 and soluble toxic Aβ that have detrimental effects on neurons
Neurodegenerative associated proteins such as Aβ, Tau, prions
In addition, these exosomes could be exported via blood-brain barrier as circulatory EVs, which can be used for disease-specific biomarkers, even future for therapeutic researches
TABLE

Condition
Function the adult brain are crucial for cognitive function.
Neural synaptic plasticity is mediated not only by neuron-specific progression but also by glial cells, such as astrocytes and microglia
Under resting conditions, synaptic vesicles are reposited in the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal.
Many synaptic vesicles stick on some specialized sites at the presynaptic plasma membrane named active zones.
During incoming action potentials, exocytosis of synaptic vesicles confirm how much transmitter is released from nerve terminals
In addition to typical synaptic neurotransmission, signal transduction of neurons via the secretion of exosomes can induce a range of neurobiological functions including synaptic plasticity
During management of synaptic plasticity, PC12 cell-derived exosomes can stimulate synaptic pruning through enhancement of the complement component 3 level in microglial MG6 cells
For instance, enhanced secretion of cortical neuronderived exosomes containing neurotransmitter receptors leads to increased glutamatergic activity
Additionally, by managing the number of AMPA receptors for glutamate transmission, neuronal-derived exosomes might affect synaptic plasticity

Enhancement of Neuron Protection and Neuronal Development Through Exosomes
Although the understanding of astrocyte-neuron communication via exosomes remains unclear, evidence supports that it does occur, and this communication manner is required for neuronal cell survival (Figure
Neuroprotective signaling is essential for neuronal growth and survival.
PrP is a physiologically important receptor protein that protects against oxidative stress in the CNS.
Protection of neurons through astrocyte-derived exosomes is dependent on astrocyte-derived exosomal PrP transport into neurons
In addition, studies have demonstrated that microglia and oligodendrocytederived exosomes contribute to neuronal energy metabolism by transferring several enzymes involved in energy metabolism
Thus, exosomes mediate several vital processes involved in normal brain function.
Taken together, these findings suggest that exosome-mediated cell communication is emerging as a method of mediating neuron protection.

PATHOLOGICAL ROLES OF BDEs IN AD
Increased secretion of exosomes is generally thought to occur in response to stress or pathological conditions
Neuron-derived exosomes including particular proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases can be secreted from the affected neurons
In the case of AD, there are two hallmarks of AD brains, Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau, interact with specific endosomes and may contribute to exosome biogenesis in AD
Additionally, exosomal proteins, such as flotillin-1 and Alix, were observed to accumulate around amyloid plaques in AD patients
The formation, secretion or uptake of exosomes plays a dual role in the spread of oligomers and neurotoxicity (Table

Exosomes Containing Aβ in AD
Amyloid β-protein is a C-terminal cleavage product of the transmembrane APP produced by βand γ-secretase
AD is characterized by the presence of aggregates of pathologically misfolded proteins in the brain, including extracellular senile plaques mainly consisting of Aβ
Numerous reports have described these proteins and their substrates within exosomes of in vitro AD models and in exosomes derived from neurons of AD patients
Although most AD cases are sporadic, there is a minority patients from mutations in the genes encoding APP or during sequential cleavages by βand γ-secretase enzyme activities
In vitro, exosomes isolated from neuronal cell lines show that inducing AD mutations can increase sAPP protein β, sAPPα
N2a cells expressing human APP with the autosomal dominant Swedish mutation contain Aβ peptides as well as the C-terminal fragments of APP have also shown increase of production of C-end terminal fragments (a byproduct of APP after β-secretase processing)
Vesicles released by Aβ-treated astrocytes contain the proapoptotic prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR-4) protein and these vesicles cause PAR-4 associated apoptosis in naive cultures
Experiments involving the medium of neural cells expressing familial AD presenilin 1 mutations show that Aβ is associated with exosomes during their excretion process
In vivo, rodent exosomes can contain Aβ, BACE1, and presenilin 1 and 2
Exosomes isolated from bodily fluids of AD mouse model, including blood, CSF and urine, display indicative increase in the C-terminal fragments of APP
Exosomes isolated from bodily fluids of AD patients exhibit a remarkable increase soluble Aβ1-42 in
Amyloid plaques in AD brains also contain an exosome marker
The muskelin protein is involved in reorganization of the cytoskeleton and has been shown to be involved in the determination of either lysosomal degradation or exosome secretion of PrP
Importantly, PrP is a receptor for Aβ and is reported to increase the pathogenicity of AD
Muskelin may play a critical role in this type of amyloidosis.
The above data suggested the hypothesis that exosomes could seed Aβ aggregation
However, neuronal exosomes can also restrain Aβ oligomerization and accelerate Aβ fibril formation, facilitating microglia-mediated Aβ clearance in vitro
Moreover, in an AD mouse model, intracerebral loading of glycosphingolipid-enriched exosomes led to trapping and transporting Aβ into microglia, leading to a decrease in Aβ pathology
These results might explain why, at least under some circumstances, exosomes associated with Aβ have a physiological, neuroprotective function
It is also possible that in the brain as exosomes are secreted by various cell types (e.g., neurons, microglia, and astrocytes), they might exhibit contrary effects or the exosomal membranes might promote Aβ aggregation independent of protein-associated exosomal functions (e.g., Aβ degradation by exosomal insulin-degrading neprilysin or enzymes) (reviewed in

Exosomes Containing Hyperphosphorylated Tau in AD
The gradual deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within specific neurons is pivotal to the tauopathy of AD
Under normal physiological conditions, incorporation of neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau for microtubule elongation is a crucial event of neuronal synapse formation and synaptic plasticity.
Additionally, intracellular tau also participates in neurite outgrowth, axonal transport, chromosome stability, regulation the cellular transcriptome and the structural architecture of heterochromatin (for more details see the review by
Extracellular tau is also secreted into brain interstitial fluid
The above functions rely on the site-specific phosphorylation of tau
However, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubuleassociated tau protein into intracellular neurofibrillary tangles is one of the classical pathological hallmarks of advanced-stage AD
During the progressive accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated in neurons.
Meanwhile, the cellular clearance machinery takes up tau for degradation and packaging in exosomes
In an adeno-associated virus-based mouse model revealing rapid tau propagation, microglia help to spread tau through exosome release, and depletion of microglia or inhibition of exosome synthesis significantly decreases the propagation of tau in vitro and in vivo
In another mouse model of tauopathy, aggregated tau was isolated from and transmitted through brain exosomes
In these mice, exosomes that were isolated from the brains of tau transgenic rTg4510 mice containing human four-repeat tau with the P301L mutation accelerated pathological tau phosphorylation and oligomer formation
Recently, BIN1 was found to support spreading of tau via exosome release in mice.
Tau-containing exosomes isolated from the CSF of AD-affected individuals who contain BIN1-associated genetic variants in AD etiology showed seeding competence
In human patients, compared with BDEs obtained from the plasma or serum of age-matched controls, BDEs from AD patients showed a 3-20-fold increase in tau phosphorylation at threonine 181 (p-T181-tau) and serine 396 (p-S396-tau)
Moreover, compared with AD patients who had only been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, p-T181-tau levels were significantly higher in BDEs isolated from the plasma of later-stage AD patients

Exosomes Containing Synaptic Proteins in AD
One consequence of AD is neuron loss and dysfunction.
The levels of synaptic proteins, including synaptophysin, synaptotagmins, synaptobrevin, synaptopodin, Rab3A, GAP 43, and neurogranin, were decreased in the BDE cargo from the plasma of AD patients
Additionally, lowdensity LRP 6, REST, heat shock factor protein 1, HSP, and AMPA receptor levels are also lower in BDEs from the plasma of AD patients
Furthermore, neurexin 2α, GluA4-containing glutamate receptor, and neuroligin 1, essential proteins for long-term potentiation processes, were all significantly reduced in BDEs from the plasma of patients 6-11 years prior to AD diagnosis and, along with neuronal pentraxin 2, were all downregulated in BDEs
These proteins are all involved in normal homeostasis of neurons.
Further research into these proteins in BDEs could be beneficial for the search for earlier biomarkers of AD.
Ceramide and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) in Exosomes in AD Activated sphingolipids are signaling molecules that serve as intracellular second messengers and include ceramide, sphingosine, and their derivatives, 1-phosphates (C1P and S1P, respectively)
Exosomes are sphingomyelin-and ceramide-enriched vesicles formed inside MVEs and then are secreted when the MVE membrane fuses with the plasmalemma.
Exosomes can serve as a vehicle for the extracellular secretion and cell-to-cell transport of Aβ, αsynuclein and tau protein, possibly further facilitating the spread of toxic protein aggregation
S1P receptor (S1PR) signaling has been reported to participate in exosomal cargo sorting.
Activity of the S1PRmediated Rho family of GTPases is essential for this process and Gβγ inhibitors inhibit this activity
The secretion of exosomes can be regulated by the activation of neutral sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) and sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), demonstrating distinct functions for these enzymes in AD
Additionally, ceramide/sphingolipid shortage results in enhanced secretion of sAβPPα, the product of non-amyloidogenic cleavage.
However, this shortage gives rise to increased secretion of Aβ42 at the same time, probably via regulation of raft-associated proteins, resulting in alteration of the αvs.β-cleavage ratio
Enhanced endogenous ceramide and exogenous additional ceramide both elevate the Aβ level
The above research suggests the significance of the ceramide/sphingolipid levels in the process of AD.

Exosomes Containing Other AD-Associated Proteins
Dysregulation of insulin by the CNS and peripheral hyperinsulinemia have been reported as other events highly associated with AD (de la Monte, 2009; de la Monte and Tong, 2014;
A low tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) to serine phosphorylated IRS1 ratio is a characteristic of insulin dysregulation
BDEs isolated from the plasma of human AD patients have revealed an enhancement in serine phosphorylation in IRS1
This study demonstrated that significant differences in the IRS1 levels were recognizable up to 10 years prior to clinical onset of AD, which suggests that proteins within BDEs that are involved in insulin disruption may potentially be useful biomarkers for clinical diagnosis.
Moreover, exosomes have the ability to spread toxic proteins through PrP activity
PrP is a cell surface-anchored protein that is highly related to AD pathology
Its pathological, misfolded form is associated with spongiform encephalopathy
Studies in animal models of AD have demonstrated that the PrP receptor is essential for the cognitive impairment linked to Aβ
Additionally, growing evidence indicates that prion receptor on exosomes are capable of transmitting pathological substances
Aberrant autophagy is likely to play a role in this process
However, further research is needed to explore the potential mechanism connecting exosomes, AD pathogenesis, and autophagy.

EXOSOMAL MiRNA AS A DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKER FOR AD
Generally, the biomarkers used for AD diagnosis include the expression of Aβ and pTau
Unfortunately, most AD patients are asymptomatic during the pre-clinical stages, which may last up to 17 years or longer
Therefore, it is important to exploit early diagnostics to confirm and treat individuals who are at risk before severe and irreversible neuronal pathology occurs.
MiRNAs are a family of 18-22 nt single-stranded RNAs that post-translationally communicate with and regulate the expression of mature mRNAs.
Single upregulated miRNAs can target various mRNAs to decrease their expression and multiple miRNAs can target a single mRNA
Studies have demonstrated that mRNA and miRNA species are present in exosomes.
It is possible that some mRNA sequences are definitely targeted for secretion by these vesicles
Exosomal miRNAs play essential roles in intercellular communication between cell membranes in the CNS and in disease progression.
Exosomal miRNAs are also ideal targets for use as potential biomarkers in clinical diagnostics or therapies as they can be analyzed through neuronal exosomes in the patient's body fluids (A).
Indeed, some research has illustrated that proteins and miRNAs can be transferred from glia to axons
It is assumed that miRNA signaling can impact neurodegenerative diseases via the dysregulation of tau, leading to neurotoxicity.
One study convincingly demonstrated that, in brain tissues obtained at autopsy from AD patients and from those with severe primary age-related tau pathology, the level of the highly conserved miRNA-219 was decreased in the brain
Several reports have illustrated that high expression of tissue-specific miRNAs in the brain, such as miR-9, miR-29a/b, miR-107, miR-124, miR-128, miR-134, and miR-137, may result in defective neuronal development
In addition, other miRNAs are also abnormal in brain tissues during neurodegenerative processes.
These specific miRNAs, including miR-132 and miR-212, are among the most robustly declining miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD
Remarkably, miRNAs that were found to be greatly expressed in the brain were also detected in human body fluids such as the plasma, urine, and CSF.
The levels of brain-enriched miRNAs including miR-9, miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-137 have been found to be significantly decreased in plasma samples collected from AD patients
Both miR-128 and miR-134 were also examined in patients with mild cognitive impairment, which is an early stage of AD
These miRNA biomarkers in the blood represents a clinical advantage for early disease diagnosis, but differential miRNA expression may not accurately rescue abnormal miRNA expression in the brain.
The CSF represents a more relevant and suitable source for the diagnosis of CNS disorders such as AD
The levels of target candidate miRNAs such as miR-9, miR-146a, and miR-155 were shown to be greatly increased in CSF from AD patients compared with those in age-matched controls, as quantified by microarrays and qRT-PCR
Currently, urine is collected and analyzed for biomarker discovery and diagnostic purposes in clinical practice
Exosomes can be purified from the urine using various methods such as differential ultracentrifugation
However, it remains difficult to determine whether the alteration in miRNA levels in humans is a cause or consequence of the neurodegenerative process.
Investigation of miRNA analysis profiles in AD animal models might help to solve this problem.
Additionally, the potential to test miRNAs in biological body fluids may contribute to developing and promoting the discovery of specific biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

DEVELOPMENT OF A BRAIN-DERIVED EXOSOMAL BIOMARKER FOR AD
Currently, a mixed population of exosomes from various types of cells can be separated from biological fluids by multiple     techniques such as classically differential ultracentrifugation, immunomagnetic beads and size exclusion chromatography
Moreover, exosomes have a lipid bilayer to protect their cargo, which is used downstream, from RNAse treatment to be confirmed whether the miRNAs/mRNA analyzed are inside the exosomes or not
This mixed population of exosomes may be recognized by western blots or mass spectrometry using proteins that are involved in the formation process of ILVs
It is worth noting that many of these markers are not exclusive to exosomes and it is necessary to further examine the characteristics of exosomes
In the CNS, investigating cells from the brain may afford insights into the mechanisms of brain diseases
Isolating neuronal exosomes from cells related to AD may bridge the gaps in knowledge of peripheral biomarkers and provide mechanistic insight to this disease.
Recently, a precipitation/immunoaffinity system has been developed to isolate neuron-derived and astrocyte-derived exosomes from the blood of AD patients
Data from these studies suggest that BDEs from blood plasma and measurement of certain forms of tau in BDEs can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AD
Enrichment of a specific neuron-derived population of exosomes permits monitoring of target cells of interest (Table
Collectively, although exosome transfer of Aβ seems to mainly occur in AD and can be exploited as a helpful biomarker of the disease course, development of additional exosome biomarkers could contribute to a more accurate diagnosis of AD and discovering further close connections between the marker and mechanisms of the early stage of AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.

EXOSOMES AS NOVEL AD THERAPEUTICS
The BBB is a continuous endothelial membrane within brain microvessels and is sheathed by mural vascular cells and perivascular astrocyte end-feet, which seal the cell-to-cell contacts to prevent the transmission of potentially toxic compounds between the brain and the blood
In addition to transmembrane diffusion of small (<400 Da) lipidsoluble molecules, the BBB permits selective transport of some compounds into and out of the brain
Exosomes have an inherent ability to cross the BBB, and because their properties remain active in the brain, they are ideal drug delivery vehicles.
This BBB-penetrating capacity, which was first reported by
Later studies have been successful in transmitting exosomes through intranasal injection into the mouse brain
Recently, a study using rats identified that the fluorescently tagged forebrain astrocyte protein aldolase C was selectively expressed in brain tissue and could be recovered in exosomes in the blood
This study affords evidence of communication mediated by exosomes from the brain to the rest of the body
Evidence from these studies illustrates that exosomes can cross the BBB in a bi-directional manner; however, their method of accurately crossing the BBB remains unclear and requires further study.
In contrast, while exosomes may play a role in the spreading of AD, some studies have shown a positive effect of introducing non-pathogenic exosomes to change disease duration and progression (Table
In animal studies, this therapeutic effect was found when exosomes from young mice were observed to significantly downregulate aging-associated signaling molecules such as IGF1R and upregulate telomeraserelated genes such as Men1, Mre11a, Tep1, Terf2, Tert, and Tnks in aged mice
Furthermore, exosomes injected into the brain of transgenic mouse models of AD can help to decrease toxic oligomers and fibrils in a microglial-dependent manner following intracerebral administration, contributing to the clearance of Aβ in vivo
Other researchers have suggested that mesenchymal stromal-derived exosomes may have a therapeutic effect in vivo on the advancement of neurovascular plasticity in other neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke
Additionally, directed exosomal transmission systems for precision nanomedicine have attracted extensive interest across the fields of pharmaceutical sciences, molecular cell biology and nanoengineering
Exosomes are also a promising type of novel drug delivery vehicle because of their ability to cross the BBB and shield their cargo from enzymatic and chemical degradation.
Recent developments regarding nanoengineering using targeted exosomes for therapeutic purposes have been conducted by researchers, for example,
Introducing exogenous exosomes into the CNS because they can effectively cross the BBB is a potentially novel strategy for AD therapies
The field of EV research is still at the initial stage in the CNS and yet improved therapeutic applications are already being developed.

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
Quantifying changes in EV cargo would be extremely difficult because of the lack of unique region-specific markers for circulating exosomes and the inaccessibility of specific brain tissue EVs from living patients.
Interesting lines of research have examined both the induction of AD using pathogenic EVs and the sequestration of toxic plaques using exogenous healthy EVs.
It difficult to distinguish among EV types simply on the basis of protein markers or size alone.
To better interpret and replicate the experimental results of exosome studies, combined exosome isolation methods as well as improved techniques for accurate purification and characterization are recommended.
In addition, a crowdsourcing knowledgebase currently allows researchers in the EV field to track the latest EV biology and methodology
In recent years, research has been focused on BDEs to attempt to solve questions of brain-associated disorders using blood biopsies.
Exosomes isolated from plasma were used to enrich BDEs
This study demonstrated that both the number of neural-derived exosomes as well as the expression of Aβ, neurofilament light chain, and high-mobility group box 1 potentially act as biomarkers of neuropsychological impairment in HIV
BDEs from plasma have also been tested in a pilot study to examine protein biomarkers for patients with major depressive disorder
Moreover, in military personal with mild traumatic brain injuries, compared with controls, the levels of tau, Aβ42, and IL-10 deposited by BDEs were elevated
Cargo proteins and miRNA from astrocytic-derived exosomes have been analyzed to obtain mechanistic insight into AD
Additionally, other cell-derived exosomes have also been researched for other brain-related disorders.
The ability to access BDEs in plasma and other biological body fluids such as CSF and urine shows potential for clinical use in treating nervous system disorders.

CONCLUSION
Although the domain of exosome investigation, especially BDEs, remains relatively novel, attractive evidence from other fields demonstrates that investigation of exosomes can afford insight into the disease mechanisms and processes associated with AD and treatment responses.
Currently, increased research on exosomes has focused on biomarkers of the course of AD and their ability to mediate cell-to-cell communication in the nervous system.
However, additional work is needed with respect to the mechanisms of bi-directional transport of cargo-carrying exosomes across the BBB, the alterations in the number or size of exosomes secreted, changes in cargo constituents, and identification of differences in specific cell types.
Meantime, it is necessary to take into consideration that several preparations may contain another type of EVs given the procedure used to obtain them.
Exosomes derived from cells in the CNS have tremendous biomarker potential because they may reverse physiological changes in nervous system disorders, and these changes can be tested in the periphery.
