PLGA-Based Curcumin Delivery System: An Interesting Therapeutic Approach in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
Progressive degeneration and dysfunction of the nervous system because of oxidative stress, aggregations of misfolded proteins, and neuroinflammation are the key pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases.
Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder driven by uncontrolled extracellular deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the amyloid plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.
Curcumin is a hydrophobic polyphenol with noticeable neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects that can cross the blood-brain barrier.
Therefore, it is widely studied for the alleviation of inflammatory and neurological disorders.
However, the clinical application of curcumin is limited due to its low aqueous solubility and bioavailability.
Recently, nano-based curcumin delivery systems are developed to overcome these limitations effectively.
This review article discusses the effects and potential mechanisms of curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles in Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION
Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders affect nearly 1.5 billion of the world's population
Neurodegenerative diseases cause chronic impairment of sensory, motor, behavioral and cognitive functions due to progressive loss of CNS neurons.
Most forms are associated with increased age and are likely due to oxidative stress, aggregations of misfolded proteins
Neuroinflammation is the main contributor to the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and is characterized by the breakdown of the integrity of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), morphological changes in glial cells and extensive tissue destruction by invading leukocytes
The enhanced expression of cytokines by lymphocytes and myeloid cells initiates the inflammatory cascade.
It is then mediated by secondary messengers (nitric oxide and prostaglandins), ROS and cytokines, such as IL-1B, IL-6, IL-23, TNF-α, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and chemokines (like CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL1).

Neuro-inflammaging refers to the correlation between aging and neuroinflammation.
During this process, activated microglia and astrocytes enhance cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
Subsequently, iNOS induces proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1B) and neurotoxic factors like Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-B)) which contribute to neuronal damage
Also, Toll-Like Receptors 4 (TLR4) and NF-KB activation by innate immune signal transduction adaptor (MYD88) induce proinflammatory factors (TNF-B, IL-1B, IL-6 and iNOS), which in turn potentiate various inflammatory pathways.
A significant contributor to maintain a neuroprotective state against neuroinflammation is the heat shock response
The respective genes involved are known as vitagenes, which are involved in the production of antioxidant and anti-apoptotic molecules and activation of pro-survival pathways
The members of the heat shock protein family include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), heat shock protein (Hsp70), sirtuins (Sirt-1), γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR)
In addition, neurotoxicity could be due to proteotoxicity, which refers to the toxic effect of proteins/peptides misassembly and aggregation in several cell types.
The proteotoxicity-associated neurotoxicity mechanisms are inadequately recognized; nevertheless, it is well known that protein aggregation is significantly associated with neurodegenerative disease development
The recognition of proteotoxic insults accompanied protective cellular stress response pathways and chaperone networks associated with preventing protein misfolding and aggregation are required for the adaptation and survival of cells and organisms
Cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases showed chronic proteotoxic stress where the cell's chaperones capacity and other homeostasis components seem poorly adapted
In this way, the nonnative protein species accumulate, following the dysregulation of protein folding quality that can develop oligomers, aggregates, and compositions characteristic of neurodegenerative disease
Consequently, damage of proteome integrity due to reduction in biosynthetic and repair activities affects protecting genes (vitagenes) that regulate aging, thereby affecting the health and lifespan of the organism
The pharmacologic regulation of pathways involved in cellular-stress response is a potential target for some disease therapies like cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases
The achievement of the therapeutic dose is crucial for any successful medical intervention.
Understanding the doseresponse nature, especially in the low-dose zone
However, it is reported that conventional dose-response models (commonly accepted threshold and linear dose-response models) were unsuccessful in accurately predicting responses in the low-dose zone.
In contrast, the hormetic dose-response has been reported remarkably powerful
Consequently, a hormetic dose-response consideration in the performance, toxicological and pharmacological studies analyses has been proposed to improve the drug development process and chemical hazard/risk assessment

ADAPTIVE STRESS RESPONSES/HORMESIS ROLES IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
Hormesis is a common toxicologic term that refers to a dose-response phenomenon to a chemical agent or environmental factor identified by low-dose stimulation, zero dose and high-dose inhibition.
Therefore, it may be graphically illustrated by a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped doseresponse (the "U" arms are inhibitory or toxic concentrations while the curve zone stimulates a beneficial response)
The normal physiological function of cells and organisms and some natural and synthetic molecules (nutrition) follows a hormetic curve with deficient homeostasis and toxicity regions.
Homeostasis is a hormetic zone of physiological concentrations with a safe and beneficial dose and the therapeutic window, a synonym of the hormetic zone in pharmacology
It is reported that a different type of oxidative and other stresses could induce hormesis as an adaptive response that contributes to the resistance of cells/organisms to higher (and normally toxic) doses of the same stressing agent
Studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) impair cellular homeostasis through complicated and irreversible damage to cellular components
During oxidative damage, the high reactivity of molecular oxygen and its intermediates is produced, resulting in DNA, lipids and proteins oxidative modifications
Mitochondria is one of the main sources of ROS (superoxide anion radical) as unwanted by-products of oxidative phosphorylation.
The excessive production of ROS has been involved in several pathological conditions, including inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease and cancers
In addition, superoxide production by mitochondria is considered to participate in neuronal damage varying from chronic intermittent cerebral hypoxia
Besides the adverse effects of ROS on cell function and survival, it is now apparent that mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in lower subtoxic levels play critical roles in a variety of cellular functions and can also stimulate signalling pathways that improve cell survival and protect cells against injury and disease
This neuroprotective impact of a subtoxic rise in cellular oxidative stress is known as ''preconditioning''
Based on the latest evidence, neuroprotective features of antioxidants, iron-chelating in addition to anti-inflammatory agents with distinct consideration to polyphenols have attracted particular attention
According to the hormesis theory, a stressor agent (drugs, toxins and natural substances), if administered at low doses, may trigger a positive response in the duration of adjustment or protection from the stressors.
In contrast, at a higher dose, the toxic effect predominates
Based on in vitro evidence, polyphenols stimulate the heat shock protein (Hsp) pathway by applying this paradigm, which represents a critical role in the cellular stress response
Two members of the Hsp family, Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Hsp70, also remembered as vitagenes, because of their antioxidant activity, have attracted significant attention
Various studies on experimental models of cancer
These pathways generally involve the kinases and transcription factors activation, including the antioxidant response element (ARE), Nrf-2 (a transcription factor) and its genetic target activation by sulforaphane and curcumin
These events finally result in increased cytoprotective protein production, including antioxidant enzymes, phase 2 enzymes, heat-shock proteins, growth factors and proteins required for regulating cellular metabolism
For example, it is reported that Hidrox (HD) is a polyphenol complex from organic olives containing 40-50% of Hydroxytyrosol, which could inhibit the activation of NF-κB and decrease the iNOS levels.
This study showed that redox homeostasis regulation by Nrf2 presumably leads to the regulation of NF-kB activity and the inflammatory response characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD)
Another similar study also revealed that hydroxytyrosol as polyphenols of the olive oil inhibits neurodegeneration (Parkinson's-like phenotypes) in nematodes and rodents, presumably through the Nrf2 signalling pathway and hormesis response
Consequently, from the viewpoint of hormesis response, the achievement of the right doses of administrated agents like phytochemicals or chemical drugs is required to manage various conditions, particularly neurodegenerative disease, effectively
In recent preclinical studies, natural products derived from plants and herbs, such as curcumin supplementation, have alleviated neuroinflammation progression

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease mainly seen in the elderly population
However, AD is a significant concern for the 21 st century affecting more than 24.3 million people worldwide
The contributing factors in AD development include uncontrolled extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in the amyloid plaques, intracellular tau protein hyperphosphorylation, which forms neurofibrillary tangles mitochondria dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress, and eventually cholinergic dysfunction due to progressive degeneration in the basal ganglia
Amyloid proteins (Aβ) are a 42 amino acid long cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane polypeptide with neurotrophic activity.
Under nonphysiological conditions, the APP processing via β and γsecretases
These end products can form toxic AGEs (Advanced Glycation endproducts) or amyloid plaques in the parenchyma and blood vessels
These plaques inhibit mitochondrial activity, modify intracellular Ca 2+ levels, increase oxidative stress, and stimulate neuroinflammation by impairing proteasome function.
In addition, Aβ peptides can induce tau hyperphosphorylation (a microtubule-associated protein) through the interaction with the signaling pathways that disrupt axonal transport and increase neurofibrillary tangles and soluble tau seen in AD.
Also, Aβ restricts tau protein degradation
Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Aβs stimulate microglia to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, leading to neuronal damage in AD

NOVEL THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES DEVEL-OPMENT IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
The current AD therapeutic approaches are categorized into mechanism-based strategies, including the Amyloid targeting (Suppressing Aβ Production, stimulating Aβ clearance and preventing Aβ aggregation), Tau targeting (Tau stabilizers and aggregation inhibitors, therapies targeted at Tau post-translational modifications and anti-tau immunotherapy), targeting of apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) function, and neuroprotective therapies (neurotrophins and their receptorbased therapies, therapies targeted at neuroinflammation and oxidative stress).
In addition, non-mechanism-based approaches in AD treatment included symptomatic cognitive enhancers, treatments and interventions for AD prevention (secondary AD prevention interventions and primary preven-tion).
Ultimately, lifestyle modifications and risk factor management, including non-pharmacological interventions, have been examined in AD prevention trials
Besides, phytochemical's efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD, have been investigated by numerous studies.
Various studies investigated the probable efficacy of phytochemicals like berberine, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol and limonoids against the most common neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD
Currently, nanomedicines for improving traditional therapy have entered the clinical practice of several diseases, especially allergy, cancer and cardiovascular disorders.
There are several clinical studies on the use of liposomal, gold and polymeric nanoparticles
In addition, a few nano-based products are already used by oncologists.
Nanomedicines via loading and delivering drugs to the targeted site, specific release profiles (depot effects), preserve the loading drugs from enzymatic degradations and improve bioavailability, provide helpful information at the cellular and tissue scales for designing patient-specific therapeutic interventions in various diseases
As mentioned, curcumin as a phytochemical offers promising safe and inexpensive preventive options for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, because of its actions on several molecular aspects of these diseases

BIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF CURCUMIN
Curcumin is a hydrophobic polyphenol produced by Curcuma longa L.
It is dietary safe
Curcumin exerts its antioxidant effects through different mechanisms.
It can directly scavenge free radicals via its two phenolic sites and suppress ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production in the cellular environment.
It also suppresses protein and DNA oxidation through the reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
The expression of ROSgenerating enzymes is inhibited, whereas antioxidant enzymes are upregulated by curcumin
Curcumin modulates neuroinflammation by the downregulation of various inflammatory cytokines
Curcumin has pleiotropic activities through its complex chemistry and its capacity to affect various signalling pathways, including angiogenic and metastatic pathways, survival pathways like those regulated by NF-kB and growth factors Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective pathways
It has been demonstrated that curcumin is a hormetic agent via biphasic dose-responses on cells.
It is stimulatory at low doses (like activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway and an antioxidant function) and inhibitory at high doses (like autophagy and cell death induction).
This means that several curcumin effects are dosedependent, and some effects might be more prominent at lower doses, characteristic of a hormetic response.
Curcumin has a modulatory effect in neurological diseases, such as AD,s with a hormetic dose-response [141].

CURCUMIN LIMITATIONS
Despite the promising effects of curcumin in numerous clinical trials, it is not yet certified for clinical application.
The main obstacles include low oral bioavailability, with an extremely low plasma concentration of 1%
Low structural stability, limited absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, accelerated metabolism, and rapid systemic clearance is other reasons for curcumin's limited utility in the clinical setting
Limited stability of curcumin at alkaline conditions and light sensitivity are other concerns associated with curcumin

DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL CURCUMIN FOR-MULATIONS
To date, various formulations have been developed to improve curcumin bioavailability and drug delivery.
Modifying the solid-state, formulating supersaturated solutions
Other techniques include reducing particle size, combining curcumin with cellular metabolism and drug efflux suppressors [151]; the addition of adjuvant molecules, such as piperine‚ quercetin or silibinin‚ chemical combination of curcumin with polysaccharides, proteins or phospholipids and bio-conjugation of curcumin with turmeric oil or alanine
Despite the potential effects of these strategies in improving the solubility and bioavailability of curcumin, most of these formulations fail to target curcumin to specific sites of action and preserve its chemical structure, resulting in its rapid metabolization and removal.
Nowadays, nanotechnology-based methods are introduced as promising substitutes for conventional formulations
The main categories of nanoformulation-based strategies are the application of stabilizers, adjuvants or polymer conjugates, and the development of liposomes, hydro/micro/nano gels, micelles, and nanoparticles (NPs) [152,
Curcumin-nanoparticulated delivery methods represent potent carriers in treating neurodegenerative disorders since the desired size, chemical structure, surface zeta potential charge, and surface functionalization can be modified
It is demonstrated that curcumin encapsulation into nanoparticles remarkably improves its bioavailability, solubility, and chemical stability by protecting it from the outside environment's influence, such as enzymatic and pH degradation
Nanocarriers' toxicity potential is the primary concern of many researchers since their composition and size must be non-invasive for medical purposes.
The size of NPs and their elimination and biodegradation determine their safety.
The average size of nanoparticles for drug delivery systems is less than 200 nm for brain applications but is conceptually expandable up to 1000 nm.
The nanoparticles were developed based on two original opinions; the theory of magical bullets from Paul Ehrlich
The first investigation on drug transport to the brain by nanoparticles was performed in 1969
Afterwards, functionalized nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 facilitate their entry into the CNS.
The same application was introduced by Müller et al.,
Subsequently, cellular pharmacokinetic and mechanistic studies were performed to improve vectorization.
Recent studies focused on curcumin-loaded nanoparticle delivery systems, specific CNS targeting, and intranuclear levels in neurons
Initially, polymeric nanoparticles were applied for drug delivery to the CNS, which included poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), chitosan, and poly (butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA)
Polymeric nanoparticles are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and they are less toxic than the other compounds
PLGA nanoparticles as biodegradable and biocompatible polymers with characteristics, such as the controlled release of various pharmacologically active groups
The biodegradable and biocompatible properties of PLGA are due to their hydrolytic cleavage into natural metabolites (i.e., lactic acid and glycolic acid), metabolized through the Krebs cycle and are then discharged as carbon dioxide and water
The hydrophobic nature of PLGA guarantees significant entrapment and sustained release of curcumin
It could also cross the lipophilic olfactory and trigeminal nerves
Herein, the current experimental and clinical literature on the effects of curcumin-loaded PLGA particles on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reviewed.

CURCUMIN EFFECTS ON AD
Curcumin inhibits two major pathological changes in AD; it blocks the self-assembly of Aβ plaques
Also, curcumin has potent neuroprotective effects due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
It inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines, cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)
An interesting feature of curcumin is its facilitated BBB penetration due to its unique charge and binding capabilities
It is demonstrated that neuronal signaling, membrane homeostasis and cognitive defects following a traumatic brain injury could be improved by curcumin

EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES RE-LATED TO AD
The in vitro/in vivo studies on curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs formulations and their application in AD are summarized in order of publication year (Table
Yin-Meng Tsai evaluated the curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs distribution and showed that Cur-NPs formulation significantly increased curcumin concentration in the spleen and lungs.
Compared to free curcumin, Cur-Nps remarkably prolonged the maintenance time of curcumin in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus up to 96% and 83%, respectively
It has been shown that curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs with high water solubility induced potent anti-amyloid effects
Intravenous injection, liposomes, acrylic polymer, and PLGA formulations could pass the BBB and preferentially be concentrated in the hippocampus, striata, and brain stem to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, positive neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity effects
In another study by the same authors, synthetic amyloid-binding aptamer (described as NN2) conjugated with curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs reduced the plasma amyloid levels through its effective attachment to   Curcumin formulations composed of liposomes, acrylic polymer, and PLGA Sprague-Dawley rats Preferential concentration in hippocampus, striata, and brain stem

amyloid plaques and their disaggregation
Following this study, curcumin encapsulated-PLGA NPs decorated with Tet-1 peptide with a great affinity for neurons and retrograde transportation characteristics were developed.
In vitro results showed that these NPs are non-cytotoxic, destroy amyloid aggregates and display antioxidative features
Another interesting approach to improve curcumin delivery was developed by Marrachea et al.
They synthesized mitochondriatargeted curcumin-PLGA-b-PEG-triphenylphosphonium (TPP) to facilitate curcumin entry into mitochondria.
These targeted curcumin PLGA-b-PEG-TPP NPS notably enhance the therapeutic drug index for AD compared to nontargeted particles or their free forms
Doggie et al. stated that Cur-PLGA NPs could protect human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells from oxidative injury, which is also seen in AD, by preventing H 2 O 2 -induced toxicity and inhibiting ROS elevation GSH reduction and activation of Nrf2.
They suggested that this formulation is expected to have great potential for pharmaceutical application in neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD
Also, Shashi Kant Tiwari reported that compared to free curcumin, Cur-PLGA-NPs induced endogenous neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation by increasing the expression of cell proliferation genes (reelin, Pax6, and nestin) and improved neuronal differentiation by the upregulation of neuroligin, neurogenin, neuregulin, neuroD1, and Stat3 genes and in vitro activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway (regulator of neurogenesis) in the rats.
Besides, these nanoparticles reduced GSK-3β levels and enhanced TCF/LEF and cyclin-D1 promoter activity.
They also improved training and memory impairments in beta-amyloid-induced rat models of AD-like phenotypes by stimulating neurogenesis via activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway and enhancing a brain self-repair mechanism
Srivastava A et al. also reported that Cur-encapsulated PLGA NPs are potential regulators of gelsolin amyloidogenesis.
These NPs increased curcumin's solubility and reduced the effective concentration to modulate amyloid plaques by ~1000 fold compared to their free forms.
Consequently, PLGA encapsulation promoted the therapeutic potential of curcumin against amyloid fibrillation and toxicity
Subsequently, Djiokeng Paka et al. developed glutathione-functionalized PLGAnanoparticles (GSH-NPs) loaded with non-toxic curcumin, and the surface GSH presented a greater neuroprotective effect against acrolein.
These GSH-Cur-NPs had a higher and easier neuronal internalization than free curcumin due to a modified internalization route that enabled them to escape uptake via macropinocytosis, thereby avoiding lysosomal degradation
Huang et al. designed NPs encapsulated with curcumin and Aβ generation inhibitor S1 (PQVGHL peptide) to target the harmful factors in AD progression.
These NPs were conjugated with brain targeting peptide CRT (cyclic CRTIGPSVC peptide), an iron-mimic peptide that targets transferrin receptors (TfR), for advanced BBB penetration.
They showed that these NPs significantly reduced Aβ level, reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) and intensified the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the number of brain synapses, resulting in the improvement of spatial memory and recognition in transgenic AD mice.
Consequently, codelivery of an anti-inflammatory agent like curcumin and Aβ production inhibition (S1) conjugated with brain targeting peptide (CRT) revealed the most favorable effects in which CRT facilitated the BBB permeability of Cur-PLGA NPs, and curcumin decreased Aβ formation, gliosis, and proinflammatory cytokine production in the treatment of AD mice
In a study by
The primary hippocampal cell cultures subjected to these NPs showed no apparent toxicity, a significant reduction of Aβ aggregates and less inflammation, oxidative stress and amyloid plaque load.
Hence, brain delivery of curcumin using NPs to cross BBB could be a promising approach in managing AD
Later, Ameruoso et al. developed curcumin-loaded spherical polymeric nano constructs (SPNs) with a size of 200 nm and curcumin-loaded discoidal polymeric nano constructs (DPNs) with a size of 1000 nm using PLGA, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lipid chains as building blocks.
They evaluated specific curcumin delivery to macrophages, previously stimulated by incubation with Amyloid-β fibrils produced in vitro.
The cytofluorimetric and confocal microscopic analyses demonstrated that Cur-SPNs are taken up more quickly by macrophages than Cur-DPNs.
Also, Cur-SPNs diminished the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in macrophages stimulated via amyloid-β fibers up to 6.5-fold
It is demonstrated that other than the brain, peripheral organs like the liver can also produce amyloid proteins
It is safer and easier to reduce peripheral amyloid due to difficulty in BBB penetration of drugs targeted to the CNS and cerebral toxicity
In this regard, Takahashi et al.
In another study, curcumin-loaded PLGA-PEG were conjugated with B6 peptide as a brain target, which showed that these NPs possessed adequate blood compatibility and increased curcumin cellular uptake.
Also, Cur-PLGA-PEG-B6 could remarkably improve the spatial training, and the memory ability of APP/PS1 mice versus native Cur.
Further experiments confirmed that Cur-PLGA-PEG-B6 could decrease hippocampal β-amyloid formation and deposition and also tau hyperphosphorylation
Recently, Kuo et al. developed polyacrylamide (PAAM)cardiolipin (CL)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs grafted with surface 83-14 monoclonal antibody (MAb) to carry rosmarinic acid (RA) and curcumin (CUR), which was named as 83-14 MAb-RA-CUR-PAAM-CL-PLGA NPs.
These NPs increased the permeability coefficient of curcumin across the BBB and improved SK-N-MC cells' viability irritated with β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits.
Consequently, 83-14 MAb-RA-CUR-PAAM-CL-PLGA NPs may have a great neuroprotective capacity in medication management of AD to prevent neurodegeneration

Nanoparticle

CONCLUSION
The pleiotropic functions of curcumin, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well as protein aggregation inhibition, are the primary contributors to combat neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD.
The main properties of curcumin, which increased its application, are safety, low cost, easy accessibility and effective penetration into the BBB and neuronal membranes.
Nevertheless, some curcumin characteristics limited its clinical application, including low water solubility, low bioavailability, and structural instability in the body fluids.
Nano-based drug delivery systems are the emerging carriers to enhance medications' efficacy in a controlled target-oriented fashion.
In the present review, we summarized the in vitro/in vivo studies and clinical trials on curcumin-loaded PLGA NPs to prevent and treat AD.
However, most of the available results have been obtained from in vitro strategies using multiple nano-curcumin technologies that could promote curcumin delivery in the SNC.
Other than multiple nano-curcumin implications, more studies are yet expected to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of these NPs on a larger group of patients.
The main concerns regarding nanomedicine-based delivery systems are the possible toxic effects of curcumin-loaded NPs, including neuroinflammation, DNA damage, excitotoxicity, and allergic responses.
Some methods, such as combination therapy and specific targeting, can minimize these toxic effects by decreasing the main therapeutic agent's dose and functionalizing the NPs, respectively.
Consequently, nano curcumin carriers' preparation and purification methods play a pivotal role in reducing the aggregation and mechanical properties of NPs to mitigate their toxicity.
