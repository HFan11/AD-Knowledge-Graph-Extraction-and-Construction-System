INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders.
It has been rising significantly over the years among the elderly population over the years
The most common clinical symptoms of AD include memory impairment, personality and behavioral abnormalities, difficulty in execution, and apraxia as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions
Progressive researches have shown that besides loss of neurons, the pathophysiology of AD primarily includes amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, formation, and deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that have hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, generation of oxidative stress, and microglial damage leading to activation of major protein NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome that eventually leads to neuroinflammation and dementia.
When compared to a healthy brain, the brains of Alzheimer's patients exhibit a substantial deposition of tau protein and interaction with abnormal Aβ proteins
These alterations are closely linked with abnormalities in innate immune system within the brain, wherein inflammatory response by glial cells and damage to blood vessels in a nonspecific manner plays a key role
The etiology and pathophysiology of AD are complicated, variable, and yet to be completely discovered.
However, the involvement of inflammasomes, particularly the NLRP3 inflammasome, has been emphasized recently
NLRP3 is a critical pattern recognition receptor involved in the expression of immune responses and has been found to play a significant role in the development of various immunological and neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, gout, diabetes, and AD
NLRP3 is a multimeric protein which releases various cytokines and causes caspase-1 activation through the process known as pyroptosis.
Increased levels of cytokines , caspase-1 activation, and neuropathogenic stimulus lead to the formation of proinflammatory microglial M1.
Further, the inhibition of M1 microglial activation is caused by the formation of M2 phenotype which is anti-inflammatory in nature.
This process is the indication of inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome and can lead to reduction in the pathogenesis of AD and could have potential as a target for the management and treatment of this disease.
Recently, various published evidence have strengthened the pathological involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the etiology of AD, and hence, several attempts were made to develop or repurpose drug candidates that can inhibit the NLRP3 mediated AD.
The importance of NLRP3 in neurological disorders can be validated from the fact that currently a number of synthetic NLRP3 inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials to bring them from bench to bedside.
However, the synthetic agents have exhibited a few limitations such as the lack of well-validated safety profile, lower solubility, impermeability in crossing BBB, and unwanted adverse effect.
Researchers have, thus, also explored the NLRP3 inhibitory activity of clinically established drugs such as statins and various natural products.
The current manuscript describes the functional composition, various models, signaling molecules, pathways, and evidence of NLRP3 activation in AD.
The manuscript also discusses the synthetic drugs their clinical status and projected natural products as a potential therapeutic approach to manage and treat NLRP3 mediated AD.

STRU CTU RE AND FUNCTION OF NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME
Inflammasomes are also referred as multi-protein complexes that identify the foreign pathogens as well as the host's own distress signals.
The structure of inflammasomes consists of a molecular receptor protein (including classical NLR as well as non-classical NLR), an adaptor protein (generally ASC), and caspase-1 precursor protein.
The ASC protein, or apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, comprises a pyrin domain (PYD) at the N-terminus and a cysteine aspartic proteinase recruitment domain (CARD) at the C-terminus.
CARD functions as a recruitment effector protein that may be identified and connected to the CARD domain of pro-caspase-1
Distinct molecular receptor proteins form distinct inflammasomes
Inflammasomes, upon identification of distress signals, trigger the recruitment and activation of proinflammatory pro-caspase-1 enzyme.
NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3 protein, ASC protein, and caspase-1 precursor protein and plays the crucial role in the pathogenesis of various pathogenic conditions including AD
NLRP3 is a pattern recognition receptor protein with a leucine-rich repeat domain and a carboxyl terminal; however, it lacks the CARD domain and hence cannot bind directly to caspase-1 precursor.
Rather, it primarily binds to ASC protein via PYD-PYD linkage, which then binds to pro-caspase-1 via CARD-CARD linkage.
Pro-caspase-1 initially forms a tetramer and subsequently forms heterodimer having enzymatic properties
Caspase-1 protein has the ability to convert inactive precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 into their corresponding active matured forms to perform a range of non-specific inflammatory actions
NLRP3 inflammasome activation can lead to the emergence of a variety of pathogenic conditions such as gout, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and AD
Thus, understanding the function, activation, and mechanism of action of NLRP3 inflammasome has ample clinical significance in the prevention and treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.

MECHANISM OF ACTIVATION OF NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME
Various internal and external signals such as pathogens associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), calcium pyrophosphate, silica, palmitate, sodium urate, cholesterol, and lipopolysaccharides have been associated with the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
Some danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cathepsin B also activate this inflammasome
Recently, sodium channels, specifically dysregulated epithelial sodium channels, have also been found to play important role in activating NLRP3 inflammasome
Currently, three theories have been stated to explain the mechanism by which NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by foreign signals
The first one is the theory of lysosomal damage, which states that, when PAMPs are engulfed by the macrophage cells, they destabilize the phagocytes and cause lysosomal acidification.
As a result, the wall of the lysosome ruptures and cathepsin B is released in the cytoplasm.
Cathepsin B potentially degrades the inhibitory protein of NLRP3 and thus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome
To upregulate the expression of NLRP3, macrophage cells must be subjected to initial stimuli that triggers the activation of transcription factor NF-kB via Tolllike receptor (TLRs) ligands and cytokine receptors.
Molecules that influence NF-kB activity can indirectly alter NLRP3 priming.
The activated NF-kB promotes the transcription, translation, and subsequent posttranslational modifications of the NLRP3 mRNA in order to complete the priming of NLRP3
Another theory states that ROS play a key role in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
Increased ROS level due to oxidative cell stress promotes the auto-oxidation of thioredoxin protein (TRX) that is bound to thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) under normal conditions.
The separated TXNIP then binds to NLRP3 protein, relying on the ASC domain to recruit pro-caspase-1 and completes the assembly, thereby leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
Activation signals, such as elevated glucose levels, ATP, and so on, typically activate the inflammasome in this manner
According to the mitochondrial DNA hypotheses, NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA), which is released from the damaged mitochondria when attacked by PAMPs and DAMPs.
This type of activation method is facilitated by increased calcium influx, potassium outflux, cytotoxinmediated cell membrane breakdown, binding of ATP to ligand-gated purinergic ion channel 7 receptor (P2X7R), and microbial toxin intervention in the mitochondrial micropore as shown in Fig.

K + Efflux and NLRP3 Activation
According to ion channel hypothesis, NLRP3 activation occurs via efflux of K + ion which it can be induced by various activators of NLRP3 such as ATP, uric acid, and nigericin
Reduced intracellular K + concentration is a trigger activation of inflammasome of NLRP3, and its high concentration outside the cell produces opposite effect by blocking it.
K + efflux also mediates the release of IL-1β from monocytes and macrophages and potentiates the conversion of pro-IL-1β to its active form
Study has showed that asbestos and aluminum hydroxide silica that promote the efflux of K + are unable to stimulate NLRP3 activation, unless it is pre-stimulated by LPS microbial ligands or any other stimulus
Additionally, compounds such as GB111-NH2, CL097, and imiquimod can induce NLRP3 without K + efflux
Consequently, K + efflux may not be a strong and independent factor for the NLRP3 activation.

Ca 2+ Mobilization and NLRP3 Activation
Calcium mobilization is prevalent in many signaling pathways.
Numerous studies have shown the pathogenic role of Ca 2+ in NLRP3 activation.
Enzyme Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Its Inhibitors as Emerging Therapeutic Drug Candidate phospholipase C hydrolyzes PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate)
IP3 afterwards triggers Ca 2+ efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through IP3 receptor (IP3R) and increases the intracellular
Intracellular Ca 2+ level is also increased in response to opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel.
Extensive researches have been carried out, and many conclusions have been deduced to establish the positive correlation between intracellular Ca 2+ level and NLRP3 activation
Mechanistically, increased intracellular Ca 2+ level causes mitochondrial dysfunction, increases the level of ROS, promotes lysosomal degradation, and potentiates the nuclear translocation of NF-kB that cumulatively leads to NLRP3 activation as shown in Fig.
The pathogenic role of Ca 2+ in the NLRP3 activation was also confirmed in the study where chelator of Ca 2+ "BAPTA-AM" pyroptosis
Additionally, 2APB (2-aminoethoxy diphenylborinate) which is a IP3 receptor antagonist and Ca 2+ blocker inhibit calcium influx and thus mitigate NLRP3 activation.

Na + and Cl -Efflux and NLRP3 Activation
Na + and Cl -efflux and NLRP3 activation have been reported in various published reports.
Preventing Na + influx through the reduction of extracellular Na + ion concentration decreases NLRP3 inflammasome activation
Increment in the Na + concentration inside the cell causes swelling of the cell and inflow of water which further decreases the K + ion concentration inside the cell and potentiates the NLRP3 activation
An increase in the intracellular Cl -ion concentration also upregulates the secretion and maturation of pro-IL-1β, and increase in the extracellular concentration of Cl -downregulates IL-1β activation and secretion
Studies have revealed that Cl -channel inhibitors such as flufenamic acid, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) acid, indanyloxyacetic acid, benzoic acid, mefenamic acid, and 4,40-isothiocyanato-2,20-stilbenedisulfonic acid prevent NLRP3 inflammasome activation and hence strengthen the role of this ion in the NLRP3 activation
However, more detailed investigation is needed to understand how Na + and Cl -efflux trigger activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

ROS and NLRP3 Activation
ROS production via NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase and mitochondria is one of the key regulators in the NLRP3 activation
The production of ROS by NADPH oxidase can also be stimulated by DAMPs, PAMPs, phagocytosis, and ATP
There are various agonists of NLRP3 that induce ROS generation via mitochondria, and this connects the role of ROS in NLRP3 activation
The activation of NLRP3 is regulated by the ROS production that was proven by blocking of NLRP3 activation by various agonists through suppressing p22 subunit of NADPH oxidase, ROS scavengers, and antioxidants
However, ROS-inducing substances such as cytokines cannot directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and, hence, suggest that activation of NLRP3 can be processed by ROS
Moreover, inhibitors of ROS and their high concentration prevent the primary step of activation of NLRP3, but direct NLRP3 activation is not affected by them
An association was also found between K + concentration and ROS in the NLRP3 activation
Interaction is undefined between them, but either lower intracellular K + concentration is sufficient or lower intracellular K + concentration triggers the generation of ROS that in turn activates NLRP3.
NLRP3 agonists also trigger the TXNIP association with NLRP3 which is ROS-dependent NLRP3 ligand in macrophage
As the level of ROS is increased intracellularly, TXNIP dissociates in ROS-dependent manner from oxidized thioredoxin (TRX) which interacts with NLRP3 (specifically LRR) leading to its activation
Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are also reported to be activated upon NAD + depletion and consequently cause DNA damage
It is further important to highlight that mitochondrion, through their respiratory activities, produces reactive oxygen species and is thus entwined with activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
Studies reported that mtDNA is induced through TLR signaling and causes activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
These findings suggest that there is involvement of mtROS, mtDNA and mitochondrial dysfunction in activating NLRP3 inflammasome.
Cardiolipin, Mitofusin 2, and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) are the molecules of the mitochondria other than mtROS and mtDNA that respond to the NLRP3 stimuli.
MAVS is required for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by nigericin, poly (I:C), and ATP
Mitofusin 2 associates with NLRP3 directly in a viral infection.
Cardiolipin on the other hand binds with the LRR part of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and disruption in its expression decreases the inflammasome activation

The Lysosomal Rupture and NLRP3 Activation
Cholesterol crystals, asbestos alum, silica, calcium crystals, amyloid-β, and MSU are categorized as particulate matter (PM).
They damage the lysosomes, cause spilling of their contents into the cytosol, and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
Studies have also shown that silica, Aβ, and asbestos undergo endocytosis by macrophages and lead to instability of the lysosome resulting in their rupture or damage and cause release of cathepsin B proteinase into the cytoplasm that is directly involved in NLRP3 activation
Until now, the exact mechanism of lysosomal damage associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation is not known.
However, based on the published reports, it was inferred that monosodium urate releases a large amount of Na + ions and eventually decreases intracellular K + outflow concentration
Damage of lysosomes also triggers K + outflow via pore formation and can activate NLRP3 inflammasome
It was also reported that the release of lysosomal enzymes for phagocytosis of particulate matter causes the activation of the NLRP3
Additionally, increased intracellular Ca 2+ ion-induced, macrophage-induced, and dysfunctional mitochondria-induced OS causes lysosomal rupture and activates NLRP3 inflammasome
The involvement of lysosomal damage and released cathepsin B, in the activation of NLRP3, was confirmed when use of cathepsin B inhibitor, "CA-074Me," inhibited the NLRP3 activation and subsequent release of IL-1β

TLRs AND mTOR SIGNALING PATHWAY IN NLRP3 ACTIVATION
A highly expressed PRR, i.e., TLRs, play a crucial role in innate immunity
MyD88 and TIRAP-like adaptors constitute TLR pathway and mediate various Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Its Inhibitors as Emerging Therapeutic Drug Candidate sub-pathways that causes the production of multiple cytokines such as pro-IL-1β, TNF-ɑ, and IL-6 via downstream kinases such as TRAF6 and IRAK1/4
This further facilitates inflammatory responses
TLR pathways play a crucial role in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation via canonical MyD88-IRAK1/4-TRAF6-TAK1-IKK-NF-κB pathway
At post-translational levels, triggered TLRs cause MyD88/TRIFTARF6-TAK1-JNKs pathway activation, which targets NLRP3 by phosphorylation at Ser198 residue.
Following this, the deubiquitination of NLRP3 results in NLRP3-ASC assembly
Hence, NLRP3 phosphorylation via TLR is a trigger for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
NLRP3 inflammasome is completely activated only when transcriptional upregulation and post-translational modification work together
Moreover, TLR signaling also triggers alternative pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation via LPS stimulation
mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase and an essential catalytic subunit, member of PI3K-related family of kinases.
It is known to facilitate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
mTOR consists of two protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and can recognize PPRs and play a vital role in innate immune system
It has been investigated that transcription of gene can be regulated by mTOR through NF-kB pathway and can be inhibited by inhibiting mTORC1 (Rapamysin)
An increase mitochondrial ROS was also observed via mTOR, resulting in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
As per published reports, it was found that mTORC2 causes NLRP3 inflammation activation and also catalyzes SGK1 phosphorylation causing a K + efflux
Hence, it can be concluded that the regulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β expression as well as that of other components is upregulated by mTOR signaling via either AKT1-IKK-NF-κB pathway or by recognizing ROS and cation efflux
MAPK is a another serine/threonine protein kinase that can recognize various PPRs such as oxidative stress and osmotic imbalance and regulates the inflammatory responses via NLRP3 activation
Thus, NLRP3 expression as well as pro-IL-1β expression and their activation has been found to be enhanced by MAPK signaling pathway

NEGATIVE REGULATION OF NLRP3 INFLAMMASOME ACTIVATION
The NLRP3 inflammasome may benefit the human body by aiding resistance to external microbial infection and intrinsic tissue damage, when activated appropriately and adequately.
However, overactivation, on the other hand, might typically have deleterious effects on the cellular as well as bodily health.
Presently, numerous mechanisms have been reported that negatively regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome activation via binding and blocking the receptor and autophagy or by disrupting the expression of genes
For instance, miR-223 can downregulate the NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the inhibition of NLRP3 gene expression.
T cells and interferons also negatively regulate the expression of P2X7R and influence the STAT signaling pathway.
In a study, Lamkanfi and Dixit
Furthermore, dopamine, β-hydroxybutyric acid, nitric oxide, and unsaturated fatty acids have also been found to suppress the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome.
Elevated microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3B), an autophagy protein, can cause reduction of ROS levels and prevent NLRP3 inflammasome activation
The presence of NLRP3 in the mitochondria is imperative to activate and moderate its activity as mitochondrial adaptor proteins are crucial for triggering the activation.
Acetylation potentially mediates the actindependent transfer of mitochondrial ASC, leading to the interaction between the mitochondrial ASC and NLRP3 in the endoplasmic reticulum.
Autophagy-related proteins possess the ability to protect the mitochondria as well as prevent the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
RIPK2 protein suppresses the action of the NLRP3 inflammasome in influenza virus infection by increasing mitochondrial autophagy
Thus, negative regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may be mediated via a variety of unique and interesting pathways.
The production of IL-1 is inhibited by the type 1 IFN signaling pathway, which negatively affects the inflammasome activation.
In others, effector T cells suppress the innate immune response by lowering the neutrophil infiltration in an antigen-dependent manner, thereby reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Signaling Pathways Inhibiting NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation

Autophagy and NLRP3 Inhibition
During stress condition of cells such as damaged organelles, ATG complexes carry out the recycle and removal of unwanted substances by the formation of autolysosomes.
The targets are enveloped in the autophagosomes which are later fused with lysosomes and degraded by autolysosomes, and the process is known as autophagy
Over the years, autophagy has been found to be associated with various inflammatory disorders
Homeostasis is a crucial aspect, and autophagy maintains this in the innate immunity, signified by various studies in which comparatively more IL-1β was produced in ATG16L1lacking macrophages followed by inflammasome activation
Inflammasome activation requires second signals like ROS which can be prevented by the action of autophagy via NOD2-RIPK2-ULK1 pathway and PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-ATGs pathway
The evidence suggests that increased autophagy is directly related to the inhibition of inflammasome activation

cAMP-PKA Signaling Pathway and NLRP3 Inhibition
Over several years, studies have shown that serine/threonine kinase can inhibit IL-1β production and hence NLRP3 inflammasome activation
It has been reported this pathway is involved in both canonical and non-canonical pathways and is also involved in the modifications both at transcription and post-translational levels
The mechanism involves the phosphorylation of proteins and ubiquitination resulting in NLRP3 degradation induced by dopamine and prostaglandin-like products
It is well-known that phosphorylation at Ser295 residue is caused by the binding of cAMP with PKA.
This cAMP is produced by PGE2 through a series of steps where it activates adenyl cyclase after binding to the receptor converting ATP into cAMP.
cAMP is also produced by the binding of bile acid with TGR5 and that of L-adrenaline with ADRA2B.
The cAMP produced by L-adrenaline results in direct phosphorylation of caspase-11 and results in collapse of inflammasome assembly
During transcription, the inhibition of NF-κB signaling by this pathway causes a decrease in NLRP3 expression as well as pro-

AMPK Signaling Pathway and NLRP34 Inhibition
When the AMP:ATP ratio is increased inside the cell, then this serine/threonine kinase is activated and is responsible for the suppression of inflammatory responses
AMPK interferes with the IKK/IκB/ NF-κB signaling pathway and is also known to reduce the release of ROS in cells
Antioxidant effect of this signaling pathway involved the modulation of oxidation of NAD(P)H for the production of ROS in mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the inflammasome activation
Mechanistically, this pathway acts by suppressing the IκB phosphorylation and by inhibiting the NAD(P)H oxidase
Apart from this, AMPK-GSK3β-Nrf2 pathway inhibits inflammasome activation by interfering with the inflammasome assembly

Post-Translational Modifications of NLRP3 to Inhibit NLRP3 Activation

Ubiquitination
In ubiquitination (brief introduction, what is ubiquitination and all), Lopez-Castejon et al. report that NLRP3's ubiquitination activates it, while the prevention of its deubiquitiantion through b-AP15 (DUB inhibitor) suppresses it
Schorn et al. also reported that G5 (isopeptidase/DUB inhibitor) blocks NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the inhibition of ubiquitination
They also discovered that protein BRCC3 is the enzyme in mice, and BRCC36 is the enzyme in humans that is involved in deubiquitination
It was later found that FBXL2 (F-box L2) is a ubiquitin ligase and regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by proteasomes
Later studies discovered that MARCH7 regulates the polyubiquitination (K48-linked) and inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome and that TRIM31 acts in a similar fashion
Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Its Inhibitors as Emerging Therapeutic Drug Candidate

Phosphorylation and Other Post-Translational Modifications
Protein phosphorylation was observed in various signaling pathways and also in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [108].
Yan et al. observed that phosphorylation of NLRP3 is done at Ser295 by PKA (Protein Kinase A) and has a negative effect on the NLRP3 activation as it inhibits the ATPase activity of NLRP3
Guo et al. also observed that the TGR5 pathway is activated by bile acids which eventually results in PKA activation.
This pathway happens at the same site, i.e.,
Phosphorylation of NLRP3 also plays an inhibitory role in its activation that implies that protein phosphates have a modulatory role in its activation
Pathways other than phosphorylation and ubiquitination were also observed to have a regulatory role in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome

Regulation by NLRP3 Interacting Partners
Various proteins such as TXNIP, Nek7, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4), heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and its co-chaperone SGT1tat interact with NLRP3 and have been reported to modulate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
As discussed previously, the ROS which are produced by the stimuli of NLRP3 oxidize thioredoxin and lead to its dissociation from thioredoxin-interacting protein.
This results in TXNIP interacting with the NLRP3 inflammasome and facilitating its activation
It was also observed that TXNIP is non-essential in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome when it is triggered by Aβ, monosodium urate, and ATP
It was further reported by Lu et al. that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated by PKR
The lack of PKR decreases the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 and the activation of caspase-1
Nek7 is vital in the regulation of the NLRP3 activation as the catalytic residue of Nek7 interacts with the LRR and NOD part of the NLRP3 inflammasome (and it also upregulates ASC speck formation as well as activation of caspase-1 and oligomerization of NLRP3)
Many studies have revealed the role of Nek7 in the regulation of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but the exact pathway of regulation is yet to be known.
It has also been reported that Hsp90 prevents the destruction of NLRP3 by shielding it from autophagy and proteasomes, and SGT1 gene forms complex with NLRP3 and keeps it in an inactive
GBP5 (guanylate binding protein 5) is important in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome upon exposure to pathogenic bacteria, ATP, and particulate matter
GBP5 facilitates ASC oligomerization which is regulated by NLRP3
Other researches showed that GBP5 is non-essential for the activation in macrophages
So far, various studies corroborate that GBP5 facilitates AIM2 inflammasome activation and not NLRP3, and more research is needed to substantiate GBP5 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation

EVIDENCE FOR THE ROLE OF NLRP3 ACTIVATION IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
As per the published report, we came across the fact that NLRP3 inflammasome activation promotes the development of AD in 2 ways.
Firstly, by regulating the level of neurotoxins that cause neuronal degeneration and by promoting Aβ deposition, resulting in a self-perpetuating feedback mechanism that contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.
Based on the published report, it was reported that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome may be mediated by the aggregation of fibrillar Aβ or oligomers and protofibrils of Aβ having low molecular weight
It was observed that increased expression of genes of caspase-1 and NLRP3 facilitates the production of lesions in APP/ PS-1 transgenic mice brains
Further studies have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome's expression also limits the microglial phagocytosis of Aβ and, thus, promotes Aβ accumulation and synergizes the onset and progression of AD lesions
In one of the clinical studies by Ahmed et al., the correlation between NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy lysosome-labeled A0205 protein, glial maturation factor (GMF) and p-tau protein were investigated using immunohistochemistry by comparing autopsy brains of human AD patients with normal individuals of the same age.
It was found that the neuroinflammation caused by NLRP3 inflammasomes was increased by GMF, which further dampened the removal of aggregated protein via autophagy signaling pathway
It has also been observed that a key element in the development of AD neuroinflammation is translocation of peripheral monocytes over the blood-brain barrier, and this even was potentiated by the NLRP3 activation.
Furthermore, the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome can also enhance pathological hyperphosphorylated tau protein production that is permissive towards the initiation and progression of AD
Numerous research findings have shown that neuroinflammatory plaques built up in the brains of AD patients secrete neurotoxins, employ microglial cells to phagocytose the A aggregate, and release proinflammatory substances, consequently initiating the damage of neighboring tissues and amplifying the toxic effects of Aβ
In AD mouse models, it was observed that activated NLRP3 inflammasome within the cell promotes M1 phenotype microglial activation, leading to Aβ accumulation and higher cognitive impairment
On the other hand, microglial cells with inactivated NLRP3 inflammasome are skewed towards M2 phenotype, leading to decreased extracellular Aβ accumulation and prevention of synaptic nerve cell dysfunction
The overexpression of TXNIP is associated with AD pathogenesis, and this was affirmed by significant upregulation of TXNIP mRNA when their components were investigated using Western blot technique, immunohistochemistry, and PCR in the human cerebral cortex autopsy.
Moreover, close association was asserted between the overexpression of TXNIP protein and pathogenesis of AD, and hence, TXNIP which is correlated with NLRP3 activation can serve as a molecular connection between AD and chronic immunological inflammation and may be a potential target for therapeutics
Besides, Lewy body pathologies and increased levels of interleukin-1β in the brains of AD patients are also suspected to be the final product of activated inflammasome action
It was further reported that IL-1β expression was markedly reduced in the microglial cells when treated with cathepsin B inhibitor or lysosomal inhibitor cytochalasin D. This indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome may be activated by Aβ fibrils
In an attempt to comprehend the role of NLRP3 in the development of AD, Heneka et al. hybridized NLRP3 knockout mice with transgenic APP/PS1 mice.
It was observed that caspase cleavage was suppressed in the hybrid brain, while the total IL-1β concentration in the hybrid breed was comparable to wild mice, indicating that NLRP3 and IL-1β have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
In another study, in NLRP3 gene knockout AD mice, wild-type mice, and APP/PS1/ NLRP3 hybrid, it was observed that APP/PS1/NLRP3 hybrid knockout mice exhibited significant reduction in spatial and memory impairment as compared to the APP/ PS1 mice, which displayed serious spatial memory deficiencies.
LTP (long-term potentiation) is believed to be positively connected with memory and negatively with the intensity of AD.
When the plasticity of synapses was investigated within the hippocampus of mice, it was found that mice with activated NLRP3 or caspase-1 prevented LTP suppression and, hence, signified the pathogenic role of NLRP3 pathways in learning and memory
Additionally, it has been reported that in AD, extracellular Aβ is endocytosed by microglia leading to the rupture of lysosome and release of cathepsin B; processing NLRP3 mediated caspase-1 activation
In addition to it, the formation of ROS accelerated by Aβ is also involved in this process
The interaction of NLRP3 occurs directly with fibrils and Aβ oligomers that help in the promotion of ASC and NLRP3 interaction inside the cell's free environment
The first signal of NLRP3 activation is induced by Aβ aggregation where Aβ binds with CD36 which is a class B scavenger receptor associated with
This results in activating NLRP3 and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus from the cytoplasm leading to NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β transcription and their subsequent activation
Furthermore, E64d and CA-074Me are cathepsin B inhibitors found to lower memory loss and depreciate Aβ plaques
All these studies indicated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease as shown in Fig.

INHIBITION OF NLRP3 ACTIVATION AS AN EMERGING THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN THE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Based on various published report, it can be suggested that suppressing the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome has substantial potential to prevent, manage, and treat Alzheimer's disease.
B-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone that efficiently crosses the BBB and inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human monocytes, was found to be present in lower amounts in AD patients Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Its Inhibitors as Emerging Therapeutic Drug Candidate
However, its increased levels exhibited better cognitive functioning among AD patients
In another study, treatment of APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice with BHB led to a significant decrease in the number as well as volume of plaques present in its cerebral cortex, thereby suggesting BHB or BH derivatives as potential candidates to prevent or treat AD
As discussed previously, neuroinflammation plays a key role in the onset of AD, and the increased expression of IL-1β, which is the main inducer of neuroinflammation, has been observed in the brain of AD patients.
Thus, inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation can improve the abnormal behavior in AD
The application of Dapansutrile (OLT1177), a NLRP3 specific inhibitor, is reported to enhance the memory as well as learning ability, normalize AD markers in plasma, restore the synaptic plasticity, and decrease the pathological plaques in the cerebral cortex, as well as reduce the activity of brain glial cells.
Thus, based on this study, it was concluded that OLT1177 can be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of AD in the future.

SYNTHETIC DRUGS AS NLRP3 INHIBITORS
Glyburide, also known as BIIBO93, is a synthetic sulfonylurea medicament.
It is extensively employed in the USA to treat diabetes (type 2)
Glyburide has also been studied in clinical trials for the possible therapeutic effect against stroke
Glyburide does not inhibit the release of IL-1β via NLRP1 or NLRC4 pathway but does NLRP3 inflammasome-specific inhibition
Glyburide also inhibits caspase-1 activation and secretion of 1L-1β when studied against the stimuli which acts independently from P2X7 receptor
Additionally, glyburide has exhibited inhibitory potential in vivo
16,673-34-0 was synthesized during the synthesis of glyburide.

It was found that 16,673-34-0 exhibited inhibitory potential in the events at a later stage of the process (ASC binding or conformational changes)
Its exact mechanism of action is not known, and further research is required to establish its potential.
JC124 derived from glyburide was modified by Kuwar et al. to regulate the hypoglycemic activity of glyburide.
JC124 showed enhanced antiinflammatory potential when investigated against traumatic brain injury.
Treatment with JC124 also reduced caspase-1, TNFα, ASC, immature IL-1β, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and, thus, inhibited the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome

Parthenolide is a sesquiterpene lactone present in plants, and it is widely used as a medicinal herb in a variety of inflammatory disorders due to its potent anti-inflammatory effects
It suppresses the activation of caspase-1 by alkylating its cysteine residues.
It also interferes directly with the activity of ATPase of NLRP3 via modification of cystein
Nevertheless, due to its limited solubility as well as bioavailability, its water-soluble analogs, VX-740 and VX-765, are presently being studied
VX-765 and pralnacasan/VX-740 are peptidomimetic compounds and are analogs of parthenolide and act by inhibiting caspase-1, acting as.
These compounds are prodrug and hence, converted to their aldo-acids by plasma esterases and block caspase-1 by modifying the catalytic cysteine fragments left in the caspase-1 active site
VX-740 exhibited promising results in the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis models and showed anti-inflammatory potential during clinical phase I and phase II trials
However, this compound showed severe hepatic toxicity after long-term use
Apart from VX-740, VX-765 also showed potential to decrease IL-1β/18 in the dermatitis mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis.
Recent researches also showed that VX-765 mitigated the severity of AD and improved the cognitive function in mice

BHB acts by blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome activation without interfering with the inhibition of glycolysis, ROS, autophagy, and AMP-activated protein kinase
These studies concrete the fact that increased BHB concentration can decrease the seriousness of inflammatory disease which are regulated by NLRP3.
MCC950 is a diaryl sulfonylurea compound, being one of the most effective and specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors.
It is currently under great consideration for the treatment of NLRP3-mediated various disease condition including AD. MCC950 interacts with the NACHT domain and blocks ATP hydrolysis (necessary for NLRP3 oligomerization) and, thus, specifically reduces NLRP3-induced ASC oligomerization and activation, keeping NLRP3 in an inactive state
Earlier, it was found that MCC950 inhibit the maturation of IL-1β by caspase-1, but
Another recent study found that MCC950 binds directly to the NLRP3 NACHT domain's Walker B region and inhibits ATP hydrolysis and ameliorated the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasomes

This inhibitory activity is independent of ubiquitination of NLRP3.
CY-09 exhibited a notable pharmacokinetic profile along with increased stability, oral bioavailability, and safety along with remarkable therapeutic and preventive potential in the mice models of CAPS, gout, and T2D.
Further research is needed to clearly understand its whole potential
It is well established that for the function of NLRP3 inflammation, ASC is a necessary adaptor protein, and by inhibiting ASC, asbestos, silica, monosodium urate crystals (MSU), or pathogen-induced activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β can be inhibited
Also, the deposition of Aβ is promoted by ASC.
Hence, the deficiency of ASC can reduce the deposition of Aβ.
Through direct interaction with ASC, PYD-only proteins (POPs), POP1 and POP2, suppress the activation of inflammasome and disrupt PYD connections between ASC and NLRP3.
POPs can also the inhibit activation of NF-kB and could be a way to "fine-tune" the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AD. 3,4-Methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene (MNS) is a synthetic small molecule and NLRP3 inhibitor.
He et al. showed that MNSbinds to the NACHT and LRR domains of NLRP3 and downregulates ATPase activity.
The downregulating of the ATPase activity implies that MNStargets the NLRP3 cysteine(s).
It has no effect on the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes and hence acts as a specific NLRP3 inhibitor.
Tranilist (TR), a tryptophan metabolite analog, has also been identified as an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor.
TR is comparatively safer and showed high tolerance level in clinical studies
In one of the studies, it was found that TR inhibited the intrinsic NLRP3-ASC interaction but had no effect on the NLRP3-NEK7 interactions, suggesting that it directly targets NLRP3 by binding to the NLRP3 NACHT motif and hinders the NLRP3-NLRP3 interactions
However, TR does not interfere with the NLRP3 inflammasome's upstream signaling events such as the expression of NLRP3 or pro-IL-1β, K + , and Cl -efflux, ROSgeneration, or mitochondrial dysfunction.
Additionally, TR also showed potent effect against gout disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus mice models
Thus, owing to its high safety and efficacy in clinical use, TR may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of NLRP3-mediated disorders.

OLT1177 is a promising compound in the treatment of diseases related to the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Apart from the specific NLRP3 inhibitor, nonspecific inhibitors such as NSAIDs, autophagic modulator, and ILs have also been studied for possible NLRP3 inhibitory potency.
In a hybrid model of APP/PS1 mice, increased deposition of Aβ plaque was found that indicated AD pathophysiological features.
Hence, the use of NSAIDs showed reduced pathogenesis of AD through its anti-inflammatory potential via NLRP3 inhibition
Ibuprofen showed reduced area and number of deposited Aβ, inhibited microglial activation, and activated IL-1β
Moreover, NF-κB mediated transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β production can be inhibited by using NSAIDs.
Autophagy and autophagy-related proteins are the emerging therapeutic interventions for the management and treatment of AD.
As discussed previously, autophagy is a natural cellular self-protective mechanism in which pathogens, aggregated proteins, or damaged organelles are gathered in intracellular autophagosomes and eventually digested by hydrolytic enzymes in the lysosomes.
Numerous published evidence have showed that the pathogenesis of AD and Aβ clearance is impaired by inappropriate autophagy
Autophagy has been shown to modulate the activation of inflammasome by removing stimuli, activating inflammasome and degrading inflammasome contents
Furthermore, autophagy stimulated/promoted the degeneration of extracellular Aβ fibrils and also helped in the inhibition of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome induced by
As autophagy is a key part in releasing IL-1β, it can be inhibited by using Rapamycin, which is an autophagy agonist
Based numerous published studies, it was found that inhibiting NLRP3 and its progressive constituents can be set as the potential therapeutic cure for AD.
These can be inhibited by blocking IL-1β signals via IL-1β antibodies and IL-1R antagonists
Currently, the soluble decoy receptor rilonacept, the IL-1R antagonist anakinra, and neutralizing monoclonal anti-IL-1β antibody canakinumab have been investigated against IL-1β-mediated neuroinflammation and AD
Multiple non-inflammatory and inflammatory disorders have been successfully treated with anakinra to specifically suppress the activity of IL-1β, including familial Mediterranean fever, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and AD
Furthermore, several researchers have suggested that IL-1β could be a possible therapy method for Alzheimer's disease.
IL-1Ra deletion mice, for example, show increased neuronal damage, and microglial activation when it gets exposure to exogenous Aβ and treated with its inhibitor showed significant anti-Alzheimer's effect
The long-term treatment of 3Tg-AD mice with an IL-1R blocking antibody improved cognition, reduced cerebral inflammation, and alleviated tau pathology and lowered fAβ levels
As a matter of case, IL-1β inhibitors can be useful to some extent, but they might not be tolerated by everyone.
Additional detail of various other NLRP3 is shown in Table

Furthermore, curcumin prevented glutamate-induced ROS production and inhibited glutamate-induced TXNIP expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and thus found to be involved in the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation
Moreover, curcumin blocked the activation of caspase-3 and hindered mitochondrial functions in glutamate-stimulated hippocampus and thus inhibited glutamate-induced cell death
Thus, the above Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Its Inhibitors as Emerging Therapeutic Drug Candidate findings concluded that curcumin stimulates AMPK, which limits glutamate-induced ER stress and ROS generation, thereby suppressing TXNIP-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, eventually reducing the production of IL-1β in the hippocampus and minimizing brain damage
In another study, curcumin substantially suppressed the production of IL-1β induced by LPS with nigericin, MSU, aluminum, or ATP
Its pre-treatment decreased nigericin-induced intracellular potassium depletion and reduced lysosome disruption and cathepsin B leakage, as well as inhibited the release of HMGB-1 (high mobility group box 1) and hence inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation
These findings show that decrease in secreted mature IL-1β is predominantly due to the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and curcumin was found to be potential inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome.

CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
AD, one of the major neurodegenerative diseases, is the most common form of dementia.
Typical symptoms of AD are characterized by loss of memory, impairment of cognition, depression, and behavioral disturbance.
The pathological hallmarks of AD in the brain include deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques, cleavage products of the amyloid precursor protein, (APP), and Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome and Its Inhibitors as Emerging Therapeutic Drug Candidate neurofibrillary tangles containing intracellular fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau.
For many years, numerous studies have shown Aβ as a crucial DAMP-promoting neuroinflammation through multiple molecular pathways.
However, Aβ-inducedNLRP3 inflammasome activation was first described in 2008.
Using the primary microglia as an in vitro model, their study has reported that NLRP3 inflammasome recruitment was involved in phagocytosis of Aβ and subsequent lysosomal damage and release of cathepsin B.
Since their discovery about two decades ago, the inflammasome, a molecular platform triggering the activation of inflammatory molecules (e.g., caspases and processing of pro-IL), has garnered particular attention in modulating innate responses AD.
Importantly, an over-activated inflammasome complex can initiate a destructive environment and the subsequent onset of AD.
Although the role of NLRPs (especially NLRP3) has been implicated in neuroinflammation, as discussed extensively in numerous studies, a significant knowledge gap that remains is the characterization of drugs, including their efficacy and how they can be used to target neurodegenerative diseases.
Evidence suggests that HIV-1 infection leads to chronic neural inflammation, as in other neurodegenerative diseases, since the virus and its components can prime and assemble the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which ultimately leads to pyroptosis and inflammation.
The role of these NLRPs plays a pivotal role in the development of neuroHIV, AD, PD, and MS, but further studies are needed for expanding the realm of applying key molecular targets as efficacious therapeutics.
To date, numerous promising NLRP3 drugs for neurological disorders have been developed and tested; however, the biggest challenge for their clinical translation is their permeability at the BBB junction.
Thus, newer strategies, including drugs, are needed to overcome the limitations of drug transport across anatomical barriers (BBB) to have the desired therapeutic efficacy without inducing systemic or CNS toxicity.
In recent times, nanotechnology has shown great potential in delivering drugs across the BBB for  Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) has been documented as a therapeutic target in inflammation-associated afflictions.
CB2R stimulation attenuates the intensity of murine EAE.
Hence, CB2R agonists like HU-308 may be promising effective agents for intervening in NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases via autophagy induction.
Currently, various small synthetic molecules, such as MCC950, AAV2-hIL-10, zonisamide, and JNJ7777120, and natural products, such as resveratrol, tanshinone-I, and apocynin, have been explored for inhibiting microglial activation.
However, these small molecules and natural products are limited by fast hepatic metabolism and poor BBB permeation.
Nanotechnology offers the advantage over the conventional therapeutic approaches by stabilizing drugs to cross the BBB and exhibit a superior pharmacotherapeutic effect.
However, this is not always the case.
For example, nanocarriers sometimes exhibit unintended interactions with the proteins and tissues due to their size, surface morphology, and neurotoxicity.
Cationic and metallic NPs, such as gold, silver, titanium dioxide, and silica NPs, interact with the proteins, disrupt cellular structures, alter cell membrane permeability, and exhibit neurotoxicity.
To overcome this problem, incorporating antioxidants into the NPs is proposed as an alternative approach.
Unlike metallic NPs, polymeric NPs are more stable and offer controlled release and selective targeting profiles.
However, these nanocarriers aggregate and exhibit neurotoxicity.
Thus, attempts have been made to control their size, charge, and morphology to control these unwanted aggregatory properties.
Additionally, using PEG for surface coating and designing specific ligand approach will also offer selective targeting to NLRP3 and bypass the interaction with cellular components within the CNS.
Apart from the small molecules, natural products, and nanocarrier-based therapeutic approach, miRNA has also been emerged as an alternate tool to target NLRP3 in AD.
In general, RNA polymerase II is responsible for the transcription of miRNA or pri-miRNA, upon which ribonuclease Drosha further acts, and pri-miRNA is converted into pre-miRNA.
This process occurs in the nucleus, and once pre-miRNA is formed, it moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, in which it is cleaved and mature miRNA is produced.
The mature mRNA gets incorporated or loaded into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and argonaute.
Finally, these miRNAs are involved in the silencing of mRNA.
MicroR-NAs may hand out one more opportunity for suppressing inflammasomes.
These endogenous non-coding RNAs are 20-23 nt long and associated with the 3 untranslated parts (3 UTR) of protein-coding mRNAs to control their translation.
MicroRNA-223 attaches to a conserved location in the 3 UTR of the NLRP3 transcript, inhibiting protein synthesis and consequently blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β generation.
A lack of microRNA-223 is associated with neutrophilia, spontaneous lung inflammation, and heightened proclivity to an endotoxin challenge in mice.
A few other microRNAs have been documented to be players in the stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, such as microRNA-155, microRNA-377, and microRNA-133a1.
Decreasing the concentrations of such agents may prove beneficial in the intervention of inflammasome associated disorders.
However, the use of many of the necked miRNA was associated with fast degradation by RNAse, problems in crossing biological membranes, rapid clearance, and thermal instability when administered.
Hence, techniques, such as chemical modification, encapsulating them in suitable nanocarriers, and using cationic polymers, have been used to overcome these limitations.
Currently, a few nanocarrier-based (lipid-based) miRNAs, such as MRX34, miR-34a, and let-7, are under clinical investigation for possible use in various disease conditions.
Thus, based on the in-depth literature survey, available clinical evidence, and completed clinical trials, we suggest that a safe and effective nanocarrier system should be developed for the targeted delivery of various synthetic and natural drugs in addition to miRNA.
Genomic expression of mRNA in addition to pathway enrichment analysis should be done to identify selective targets for miRNA.
Furthermore, to avoid the toxicity and off-targeted side effects and to achieve cell-/ target-specific delivery of drugs and miRNA, low-dose Sharma, Satija, Madan, Garg, Alam, Shaquiquzzaman, Khanna, Tiwari, Parvez, Iqubal, Haque, and Khan combinations of miRNA and natural drugs can be used.
This novel drug delivery system may pave the way for clinical treatment in the coming years.

CONCLUSION
NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the neuroinflammatory response associated with AD.
Although the NLRP3 inflammasome has been the most intensively investigated inflammasome in the past decade, a unified mechanism for NLRP3 inflammasome activation has not been determined.
Recently, Nek7 is identified as a critical NLRP3 regulator.
Regardless of the complexity of the pathway, many molecules and drugs targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome have been discovered, providing a new direction for the treatment of AD.
The activation/ inhibition mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome and its regulation of the functional state of brain microglia and the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer's disease remain to be further studied.
Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm the role of NLRP3 inhibitors in AD.
Research on the neuroinflammation mechanism in AD is beneficial to the prevention, treatment, and management of AD patients.

Studies also indicated the potential application of various herb extracts like radix scrophulariae (RS) and pterostilbene; a phytoconstituent derived from grapes and strawberries reduced Aβ-induced neuroinflammation within the microglial cell in the treatment of AD by the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation [123, 142].
Kim et al. showed that RS treatment in 5XFAD mice inhibited IL-1β production, decreased the expression of NLRP3 protein, and showed a significant reduction in the caspase-1 activity [124].
RS also influences neuroinflammation and inhibited the expression of the BACE1 protein and formation of Aβ plaque [124].
Mirzaei et al. showed that fresh coconut oil antagonizes the Aβ-induced toxicity and showed neuroprotective activity by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activation [126].

However, there are reports available that have shown how the nanomaterial's physiological properties (material types, nanoparticle size, surface functionalization, etc.) can themselves lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation 186 in the CNS.
