Elevated plasma neurofilament light in aging reflects brain white‐matter alterations but does not predict cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease
We investigated neurofilament light (NFL) accumulation in normal aging as well as in preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and assessed individual differences in NFL load in relation to cognition and brain white-matter integrity.
We analyzed longitudinal data covering 30 years (1988-2017).
Cognitive testing was done up to six times.
Plasma NFL was quantified for controls and 142 cases who developed AD over time, and longitudinal changes in NFL were quantified for 100 individuals with three brain-imaging sessions.
Results: Longitudinal analyses revealed age-related NFL increases with marked variability.
AD cases had elevated NFL levels, while no significant group differences were seen in the preclinical phase.
Variability in NFL levels showed non-significant correlations with cognition but was associated with brain white matter.
Discussion: Our findings suggest that elevated blood NFL, likely reflecting brain whitematter alterations, characterizes clinical AD, while NFL levels do not predict agerelated cognitive impairment or impending AD.
(MCI) than in controls, and higher NFL was related to poor cognition and brain atrophy and hypometabolism.
Blood NFL concentration is increased across dementias and diseases with axonal injury, suggesting it is a general marker of neurodegeneration.
However, several issues remain.
First, long-term longitudinal NFL data covering the adult life span are largely missing, but vital for characterizing the average rate as well as individual differences in NFL accumulation in aging.
Second, the expression of NFL in large-caliber axons suggests that elevated NFL levels should correlate with white-matter alterations, but available findings are mixed and inconclusive.
Longitudinal studies show a relation of white-matter changes with decline in speed of processing
Third, a recent study
Here, to address these issues we used data from the 30-year longitudinal Betula study.
We focused on individuals with longitudinal data on blood samples, cognition, and brain imaging, as well as a casecontrol study of manifest and preclinical AD versus selected controls (Figure
We predicted (1) a significant increase in NFL plasma levels in aging along with marked individual differences, (2) relation of higher NFL levels in aging with alterations in brain white matter and impaired cognitive performance, and (3) elevation of NFL levels in individuals with clinical AD and possibly also preclinical AD.

METHODS

Betula study design
Data were obtained from the Swedish longitudinal Betula study,
An overview of the Betula design and the collection of health, cognitive, imaging, and biomarker data used in the present study is given in Figure

Participants
The Betula study comprises 4425 study participants, randomly The controls remained non-demented throughout the studied period (until 2017) and were classified as having an average episodic memory decline relative to their age.

Diagnosis assessments
Clinical diagnoses were determined from multiple sources of information with an emphasis on written and computerized medical records over the time span from adulthood to the end of the study period.
Hereby a timeline was constructed, including socioeconomic, medical, psychiatric, neurological, neuroradiological, and pharmacological data from in-and out-patient care to be integrated in the dementia diagnostic process.
The information obtained was sufficient for applying criteria-based systems, namely, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4th Edition (DSM-IV) classification.
The diagnosed AD cases all showed a progressive decline as evidenced by symptoms attributable to AD.
Individuals with cardiovascular burden accompanied with neurological signs and a fluctuating course were diagnosed as vascular dementia (VaD).
In some instances, a "mixed" The diagnostic procedure was performed repeatedly with start at baseline and thereafter every 5 years.
To increase diagnostic precision, follow-up assessments using the computerized medical record system were performed without the responsible physician having access to previously determined status with regard to possibly dementia, subtype, and disease onset.
Inconsistencies between previous and current determined status resulted in a re-assessment at a separate occasion to establish conclusive status.
Disease onset was defined as the time at which the clinical symptoms became sufficiently severe to interfere with social functioning and instrumental activities of daily living, that is, when the core criteria of dementia were met.
The diagnostic evaluation was, throughout the study period, coordinated by the same research geropsychiatrist (co-author Rolf Adolfsson).
An essential part of the identification of individuals with cognitive impairment and decline was neuropsychological assessments every 5 years.
Particular attention was given to those who met one or several of the following pre-defined criteria: low score (≥1.

Plasma NFL
Plasma NFL concentration was measured using the NF-LIGHT Simoa kit on an HD-1 Analyzer, following the instructions by the manufacturer (Quanterix Corp., Billerica, MA, USA).
The samples were analyzed by board-certified laboratory technicians following strict procedures for quality control.
A single batch of reagents were used for the analyses.
Calibrators were run in duplicates, while samples (diluted fourfold) were run as singlicates.
Two quality control (QC) samples (aliquots of two plasma pools) were run in duplicate in the beginning and at the end of each plate.
The QC sample with an NFL concentration of 6.1 pg/mL had a within-run coefficient of variation (CV) of 5.4% and a between-run CV of 7.0%, while the QC sample with an NFL concentration of 48.4 pg/mL had a within-run CV of 3.5% and a between-run CV of 6.9%.
The dynamic measuring range was 0.17 to 1800 pg/mL, and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.17 pg/mL.

Cognition
Our cognitive test battery is described in Nilsson et al.
To mitigate practice effects, we adopted a counter-balanced design using eight different versions of the sentence battery and the word list.
We also administered the MMSE and the Block Design test (from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS]
Beginning at Wave 3, we also used a 125-item letter-digit symbol substitution speed task.

Neuroimaging
The acquisition of T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and DTIseries is thoroughly described in Gorbach et al.,
A normalization in two steps, with the flow-field-maps and with a final affine registration to MNI-space, was applied on the gray-matter likelihood maps such that the amount of signal was preserved.
Spatially smoothing was done with a 3 mm Gaussian kernel.
A parcellation was applied on a mean anatomic image of the subjects using FreeSurfer 6.0 (https: //surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/).
The mean VBM-value in each of the parcels for each subject and time point were extracted for further analyses.
Segmentation, DARTEL template creation, and normalization were made with SPM12 (

Statistical analyses
The longitudinal analyses were performed in the mixed model framework, using either linear
Unless otherwise stated, the linear mixed models were specified using age as a time-varying covariate, NFL group (above/below the median NFL at the sixth wave), an age-group interaction, and the (non-time-varying) covariates education in years and baseline age.
As a control analysis for the VBM data, LMM/GAMM models were specified using time in years from baseline, NFL group, a time-group interaction, baseline age and a baseline age-group interaction, and finally education in years.
The generalized additive mixed model was specified using a smooth function of time-varying age as covariate.
Results for the LMM models were obtained using the R software,
We also investigated our cognitive measures' relation to age cohort and NFL group at each test wave separately, for W1-W5, using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Comparison of NFL levels between cases and controls was performed using paired one-sided t-tests.
For cases for which no control was identified, we performed analyses in two ways.
Disregarding the non-matched cases or imputing the control age group median as control observation for that case.
When analyzing the imaging sample, two subjects with observations above 35 pg/mL at one or more time points were removed as outliers, leaving us with 98 subjects and 294 observations in total.
In the case-control sample, three subjects with NFL levels above 100 pg/mL were considered to be outlying and discarded.

RESULTS

NFL increase in aging: Average pattern and individual differences
Analysis of the longitudinal observations in the imaging sample (N OBS = 294) revealed an exponential increase in NFL from the late 40s to early 80s (Figure
This average pattern confirmed an average NFL increase in aging, along with marked individual differences as indicated by the individual lines.
To characterize individual differences in NFL increases in aging, we split the longitudinal sample based on the median (13.1) of NFL at the last measurement (W6).
Individuals with high levels at W6 tended to have high levels also 5 (W5) and 15 (W3) years earlier.
A categorical analysis of NFL levels above/below the median at Waves 3 and 6, respectively, revealed a significant (Chi-square [

NFL levels in relation to brain white matter
We first conducted a whole-brain VBM analysis and tested for NFL group (high/low) by age interactions, with focus on the brain white matter.
In line with our predictions, both VBM models (see the Statistical Analyses section) identified significant interaction effects in white-matter loci in the posterior and mid-anterior corpus callosum (CC).
These effects reflected a greater reduction in white-matter volume with increasing age in the high NFL group.
Other significant VBM interaction effects were located in the gray matter of the left temporal cortex (Table
Analyses of the integrity of white-matter microstructure (DTI-FA) in the CC revealed a significant (F[1,120] = 4.376, P = .039)
group-by-age interaction in the posterior CC (splenium; Figure
Similar but non-significant trends toward reduced white-matter integrity with advancing age in the high NFL group were seen in the body and genu (ie, mid-anterior CC).
Third, analysis of the fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed white-matter hyper-intensity increases in aging, as previously reported for this sample.
However, no significant NFL group by age interaction was found (F[1, 177] = 1.633,
P = .20,

In the preclinical phase, no significant (P's > .1)
case-control differences were seen (Figure
When the NFL data from the AD-Control sample were plotted as a function of age and NFL load (median-split in each age group) we replicated the pattern in the imaging sample of increased NFL levels in older age, particularly in the high NFL subgroup (Figure
The majority (27% or 73%) of the 37 individuals with AD diagnosis fell in the high NFL subgroup, whereas the 105 preclinical cases were evenly distributed over the high (51) and low (54) subgroups.
Thus, non-demented individuals in the low NFL subgroup were as likely to develop dementia in the future as individuals with high NFL load.

NFL levels in relation to cognition
In the analyses of cognitive performance in relation to individual differences in NFL, we took advantage of the longitudinal design in which we have data from seven (MMSE, episodic memory, block design) or five (speed) test waves, respectively (see Figure
However, with the exception of a significant interaction for the block-design task (F[1,556] = 7.10, P = .008,
Figure
In the AD-Control sample, an age group by NFL load (7 × 2) ANOVA examined whether individuals with higher NFL levels displayed poorer cognitive performance.
Consistent with the findings from the imaging study, no significant interaction effects were observed for MMSE (W1-W5), episodic memory (W1-W5), or speed (W3-W5; all 13 P-values > .10,
except for speed at W4 with P = .048).
Also, no significant effect was seen for block design (W1-W5; all three P-values > .10; Figure

DISCUSSION
We present a large-scale study of plasma NFL changes in adulthood and aging.
Consistent with our prediction, in both the longitudinal (Figure
These observations suggest that the brain changes that underlie NFL build-up is an inherent aspect of normal aging, characterized by marked individual differences.
Many brain changes accompany On the assumption that elevated NFL reflects white-matter insult, the absence of an NFL-cognition relation is in line with demonstrations of weak and non-significant associations between white matter and cognitive decline in aging.
Some studies have found that high NFL levels relate to poor cognition,
The third prediction was elevated NFL levels in individuals with diagnosed AD, and possibly also in preclinical cases up to 15 years prior to diagnosis.
The results showed a weak but significant NFL difference between individuals with manifest AD at W3 and their matched controls.
At the individual level, most demented individuals fell in the high NFL subgroup (73%).
These findings support the view that pathological brain changes in AD, likely of a white-matter origin, translate into elevation of NFL blood levels.
However, no significant differences in NFL levels were found between preclinical cases and their controls-even after splitting the sample into high and low subgroups.
Thus, possibly due to marked individual differences in NFL levels in normal aging, NFL levels in blood do not seem to be a reliable biomarker for future AD.
A limitation of the study is that no systematic clinical examination nor post-mortem neuropathological examination were conducted within the study frame.
However, the diagnostic evaluation was based on long-term information obtained from largely all clinical disciplines via medical records.
To minimize the risk of misclassification, diagnoses were validated by repeated assessments every 5 years.
In conclusion, we found that NFL concentration is markedly increased as a function of age, with marked individual differences.
High levels of NFL were related to brain white-matter integrity, in particular in the splenium of the corpus callosum, but did not relate to cognitive decline or upcoming AD.
Future studies should test whether NFL is a stronger biomarker for other forms of dementia than AD, such as white-matter dementia.

selected from the population registry, into six age-and sex-stratified cohorts (S1-S6).
Health-and cognitive data were collected in up to six test waves (W1-W6) 5 years apart, in total 25-year follow-up time(1988-2014).
In 2017, a seventh test wave (W7) was conducted, only including S1 and S3 participants with imaging data from W5 and W6 for a third magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/function MRI (fMRI) investigation (n = 100).
The participants considered for the present study were obtained from two longitudinal samples; sample 1 (S1; n = 1000) included at W1, 1988-1990, and sample 3 (S3; n = 963) included at W2, 1993-1995.
Because plasma sampling was introduced at the third test RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 1. Systematic review: Previous studies have shown that blood neurofilament light (NFL) levels are increased in dementias and diseases with axonal injury, suggesting elevated levels could serve as a non-invasive biomarker of neurodegeneration.
This work is properly cited.
The longitudinal accumulation of NFL in normal aging and in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear.
2. Interpretation: Our findings link age-related increases in NFL levels in blood to brain white-matter alterations, thus validating the usefulness of measuring NFL in blood.
Our findings of no correlations of NFL levels with cognition or impending AD inform current efforts at identifying early biomarkers of dementias.
Future directions: To investigate blood NFL levels in relation to other forms of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases.

Less common dementia disorders such as frontotemporal dementia (FTP), Parkinson dementia (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were extensively examined within the Departments of Geriatric Medicine and Neurology, and diagnosed with established criteria (https://medlineplus. gov/degenerativenervediseases.html).
Symptoms of cognitive impairment close to death, often accompanied by severe somatic conditions and delirious episodes, were not included in the dementia group, nor were individuals exhibiting a long-term low cognitive capacity after, for example, trauma, stroke, tumor, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In (B), data from W3 are presented (ie, when the serum samples were taken), but similar non-significant group effects were seen at all waves normal aging 26 but given that NFL primarily is located in long myelinated axons 8 elevated NFL should most closely reflect white-matter changes.
Consistent with independent past findings,
Such abnormalities are typically of an ischemic origin
Instead, we found that the high NFL group had reduced white-matter integrity (DTI) and volume (VBM) in the splenium of the corpus callosum.
The analyses of whether age-related cognitive impairment was more marked in individuals with high NFL levels provided minimal support for a relation of NFL levels with cognition.
It is noteworthy that we failed to find a robust NFL link to cognitive level and change in a comparison of the low and high subgroups' cognitive change over 25 years.
