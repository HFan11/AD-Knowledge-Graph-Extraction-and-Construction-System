The Ubiquitin System in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, most prevalent in the elderly population and has a significant impact on individuals and their family as well as the health care system and the economy.
While the number of patients affected by various forms of dementia including AD is on the increase, there is currently no cure.
Although genome-wide association studies have identified genetic markers for familial AD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and development of both familial and sporadic AD remain poorly understood.
Most neurodegenerative diseases and in particular those associated with dementia have been defined as proteinopathies due to the presence of intra and/or extracellular protein aggregates in the brain of affected individuals.
Although loss of proteostasis in AD has been known for decades, it is only in recent years that we have come to appreciate the role of ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms in brain homeostasis and in brain diseases.
Ubiquitin is a highly versatile post-translational modification which regulates many aspects of protein fate and function, including protein degradation by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), autophagy-mediated removal of damaged organelles and proteins, lysosomal turnover of membrane proteins and of extracellular molecules brought inside the cell through endocytosis.
Amyloid-β (Aβ) fragments as well as hyperphosphorylation of Tau are hallmarks of AD, and these are found in extracellular plaques and intracellular fibrils in the brain of individuals with AD, respectively.
Yet, whether it is the oligomeric or the soluble species of Aβ and Tau that mediate toxicity is still unclear.
These proteins impact on mitochondrial energy metabolism, inflammation, as well as a number of house-keeping processes including protein degradation through the UPS and autophagy.
In this chapter, we will discuss the role of ubiquitin in neuronal homeostasis as well as in AD; summarise crosstalks between the enzymes that regulate protein ubiquitination and the toxic proteins Tau and Aβ; highlight emerging molecular mechanisms in AD as well as future strategies which aim to exploit the ubiquitin system as a source for next generation therapeutics.

Alzheimer's Disease

Dementia
Neurodegeneration is an umbrella term used to describe the degeneration and eventual death of neurons which usually occurs late in life or in individuals with an associated neurodevelopmental defect.
Amongst neurological disorders, dementia is caused by the progressive loss of cognitive functions which leads to symptoms such as memory loss and disorientation.
The main differentiating factor that assists in characterising the various forms of dementia is whether the pathology primarily affects the cortical regions (outer layer of the cerebrum) or non-cortical regions (involving the thalamus, basal ganglia and vasculature).
Cortical dementias include Alzheimer's Disease (AD) which is the most common form of dementia with around two-thirds of cases, Vascular Dementia (VD) which accounts for 20% of dementia cases, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) which represents 10-15% of cases, and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) with less than 5% of dementia cases
AD is defined by a progressive decline in mental, behavioural and cognitive functions, with a median survival time from diagnosis of less than five years
FTD, commonly termed Pick's Disease, can be easily confused with AD at the time of diagnosis.
Both dementias are characterised by progressive cognitive decline, the build up of aggregated proteins and cortical atrophy.
However, FTD can occur in younger individuals (above 35 years age) and is detected by more rapid, extreme changes in personality.
FTD-U is distinct from FTD in the fact that that it contains inclusions which stain positive for the small protein modifier ubiquitin but not for Tau, -synuclein or polyglutamine antibodies
In contrast, Parkinson's Disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD) and progressive supranuclear palsy disorders affect subcortical structures.
Both DLB and PD are characterised by -synuclein inclusions although other studies have suggested that these aggregates can also be found in other neurodegenerative diseases including familial and sporadic AD
PD dementia (PDD) is characterised by a slow progressing dementia with impairment in memory and executive functions, and it is usually observed after 10 years of diagnosis
Individuals exhibiting signs of cognitive decline within 1-year of PD diagnosis are likely exhibiting DLB rather than PDD.

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants, or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), which may be associated with familial AD mostly.
The original genetic studies identified mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP)
In contrast, genetic loci for late-onset AD include TREM2
Recent comprehensive meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci and 215 potential causative genes, suggesting roles for the immune system, lipid-related processes, APP and protein degradation in AD
GWAS have also identified specific genetic variants in different types of dementia including in FTD
GWAS have been less consistent for sporadic AD, for which aging remains the greatest risk factor.
Nevertheless, Apolipoprotein Epsilon 4 (APOE ε4) has emerged as the most prevalent genetic risk factor for both familial and sporadic late-onset AD
ApoE regulates lipid homeostasis by mediating lipid, fat-soluble vitamin and cholesterol transport between cells and tissues.
In the brain, it is produced and secreted by astrocytes and recognised by the ApoE receptor on the surface of neurons
The APOE ε4 variant is less efficient than other alleles during neuronal repair, and this may increase susceptibility to AD.
Current estimates suggest that by 2050 the number of AD cases will have reached 115 million worldwide, which represent a three-fold increase compared to 2010
Yet, the development of AD drugs showed a 99.6% failure rate between 2002 and 2012
The impending dementia epidemic is being closely monitored at the global level, and research priorities have now been identified, beyond the amyloid hypothesis.
Amongst these, fundamental research into the basic mechanisms of dementia has been highlighted as holding the greatest potential for identifying novel drug targets for AD

Molecular mechanisms in AD

Amyloid-beta (Aβ)
The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found in human, C. elegans (APL-1) and D. melanogaster (APPL) but not in prokaryotes, plants or yeast
A current hypothesis suggests that APP has been acquired during evolution at the same time as the development of a central nervous system with functioning synapses (van der
The human APP gene contains 18 exons and is prone to splicing.
In fact, tissue-specific APP variants have been identified in smooth, cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as organs such as the kidney and pancreas.
The brain-specific APP variant excludes exon 7 and 8, which suggests that the function of APP proteins is tissue specific.
Of the three major splice isoforms of APP (APP695, APP751, APP770), APP695 is the predominant neuronal form.
Studies in the invertebrate models C. elegans and D. melanogaster have revealed that APP orthologues play a role in axonal transport and neuronal signaling.
The conditional knockout of APP in mouse brains results in long term potentiation (LTP) phenotypes strongly suggesting that APP plays a role in maintaining neuronal plasticity and brain homeostasis
APP proteolytic processing is key to its function in regulating neuronal activity
The non-amyloidogenic pathway results in the initial cleavage of APP via α-secretase
Subsequent cleavage via γ-secretase results in the non-pathogenic truncated Aβ peptide p3 and the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD)
In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by the β-secretase enzyme BACE which releases sAPPβ.
It is the second cleavage by γ-secretase which leads to the intracellular release of AICD in the nucleus and of extracellular Aβ peptides (40 and 42).
Aβ peptides can aggregate into oligomers to form fibrils and ultimately plaques
Interestingly, the release of Aβ peptides into the brain interstitial fluid is activity-dependent and requires APP endocytosis and its processing by the endocytic recycling machinery, which emphasizes the role of APP processing and Aβ in normal neuronal activity
In contrast to Aβ peptides, sAPP has been shown to bind BACE and decrease soluble Aβ and Aβ plaques
Since plaques are also found in the brain of elderly AD-free individuals, the toxic potential of these protein aggregates remains unclear.
Indeed, soluble oligomeric pools of Aβ have also been implicated in driving the neurotoxic effects of Aβ
Interestingly, recent studies have shed light on the dynamic nature of Aβ conformations, by showing that plaques can be readily removed from the brain during sleep, and that sleep disturbance may affect metabolite clearance and can lead to Aβ accumulation

Tau
In contrast to APP which is an integral membrane protein, Tau is a cytosolic protein found to bind to and stabilise mitocrotubules
Human Tau consists of six isoforms with varying amino acid chain lengths.
These isoforms have a microtubule binding domain which consist of Cterminal repeats (R1-R4) and an N-terminal projection domain composed of N1 and N2 motifs.
The projection domain mediates interaction with the neural plasma membrane as well as cytoskeletal proteins through the microtubule binding protein MAP1A
Tau isoforms are named according to the presence of these motifs and include 2N4R, 1N4R, 0N4R, 2N3R, 1N3R and 0N3R
The balance between 3R and 4R isoforms is lost in tauopathies and Tau mouse models and this leads to Tau hyperphosphorylation, insolubility and in turn cognitive impairment
In the Tau hypothesis, hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulates into pathological inclusions and tangles which are observed in AD
Protein phosphorylation leads to Tau dissociation from microtubules and the formation of oligomeric species that further aggregate into paired-helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
Although the pathological trigger leading to hyperphosphorylated Tau is still poorly understood, the main kinases responsible for its phosphorylation have been identified and include Cyclin Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5), Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)
Hyperphosphorylated Tau, which exists in a soluble oligomeric form, mediates neuronal toxicity by breaking down microtubules and impairing axonal transport

Loss of proteostasis in AD
Seminal studies in C. elegans and D. melanogaster have established that Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) and mTOR pathways regulate lifespan
In C. elegans for example, daf-2 (IGFR in human) mutants are long-lived and stress-resistant.
Given that aging is the most reliable risk factor for sporadic AD, it is perhaps not surprising that these pathways, through their control of protein synthesis, play important roles in AD.
In support of this, daf-2 RNAi reduces Aβ42-induced proteotoxicity
Protein synthesis is inherently error-prone and an estimated 30-90% of newly synthesized proteins are defective and improperly folded
In eukaryotic cells, the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and autophagy participate in protein quality control to prevent the accumulation of non-functional and misfolded proteins
The endosomal-lysosomal pathway for instance handles monomeric Aβ42, while autophagy and the UPS clear Aβ42 oligomeric species
The first link between proteasomal dysfunction and AD came from histopathological analysis of protein aggregates from AD brains, which revealed the presence of the small protein modifier ubiquitin
GWAS studies have also added to mounting evidence in support for a role of altered ubiquitin signaling, with the discovery of E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM15
In addition to this, ubiquitin (section 3.3), as well as a growing number of E3 ligases and deubiquitinases, have also been implicated in AD (Table
Proteomics has also been particularly useful in order to identify changes that occur at the proteome level during AD progression.
This include for example the remodeling of UCHL5 interactome

The Ubiquitin Proteasome system

Ubiquitin
Ubiquitin is a highly conserved 76kDa protein modifier found in all eukaryotes.
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubiquitin sequence varies by only 2 amino acids compared to the mammalian one
In contrast, ubiquitin is not found in prokaryotes and instead prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) and Small Archaeal Modifying Protein (SAMP) drive protein degradation
Ubiquitin is a versatile post-translational modification (PTM) which mediates a plethora of functions including protein degradation as part of the UPS but also proteasome-independent functions
These include the sorting of receptors at endosomes
In addition to ubiquitin, mammalian cells also encode a number of Ubiquitin-Like modifiers (UBLs) such as SUMO
The structure of ubiquitin is characterized by a β-grasp fold and a flexible six-residue C-terminus tail which is important for its conjugation onto lysines of protein substrates
The hydrophobic patch formed by Ile 44, Leu 8, Val 70 and His 68 is key for its recognition by most ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs)
The hydrophobic surface which centers around Ile 36 (Ile 36, Leu 71 and Leu 73), seems to be particularly important for the transfer of ubiquitin between E2-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases
Protein ubiquitination can result in the addition of one molecule of ubiquitin onto a single lysine (i.e.
monoubiquitin) or on multiple lysines residues (multimonoubiquitination). In addition to this, multiple ubiquitin molecules can be assembled together to form a ubiquitin chain.
This is mediated between the C-terminal glycine residue (G76) on a donor ubiquitin and the free amino group of the N-terminal methionine (M1) or of any of the seven lysines from an acceptor ubiquitin.
Therefore, as many as eight distinct linkages can be formed between two ubiquitin molecules and these include Met-1, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63
Although the canonical ubiquitin signal that mediates protein degradation via the UPS was originally found to be K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, additional ubiquitin chain types including the more complex mixed and branched chains have since now been reported
This, together with the fact that ubiquitin itself can be modified with other PTM, further expands the complexity and functional diversity of ubiquitin.

Components of the ubiquitin system
Ubiquitin is covalently tagged onto target proteins via an enzymatic cascade which include E1activating, E2-conjugating and E3 ubiquitin ligases.
The C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin is first adenylated in the presence of ATP, followed by its transfer onto the catalytic cysteine (Cys) residue of an E1-activating enzyme via a thioester bond
The activated ubiquitin is then transferred in a transthioesterification reaction onto the catalytic residue of an E2-conjugating enzyme, prior to its loading onto lysines residues of protein substrates
E3 ubiquitin ligases mediate this final step, enabling the formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl group of G76 of ubiquitin and the free amino group on lysine(s) of a protein substrate
Depending on the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer onto the substrate, E3 ligases have been divided into three main families.
Really interesting new gene (RING), characterised by their RING finger zinc domain or U-box domain, are E3 ligases that act as scaffolds to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2, directly to the target substrate
RING finger domains have been shown to adopt a "cross-brace" arrangement through binding two zinc ions
RING fingers have also been suggested to activate E2s allosterically
There are over 600 RING E3s encoded in the mammalian genome, making this family of E3s the most diverse
The fact that BRCA1/BARD1 assembles different ubiquitin chains depending on the E2 it partners with, has led to the recognition that, in the case of RING E3s, polyubiquitin chain specificity is primarily determined by E2s
In contrast, Homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) E3s show intrinsic catalytic activity by accepting ubiquitin from the E2, before it is transferred to the substrate
The C-terminal HECT domain is characterised by an N-and a C-lobe, connected by a flexible glycine hinge region linking the lobes, and with the catalytic cysteine residue located on the C-lobe
In contrast to RINGs E3s, polyubiquitin chain specificity in HECT ligases is determined by the HECT domain itself, as changing the E2 that interacts with the HECT domain does not affect ubiquitin linkage type
RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ligases represent a hybrid family between RINGs and HECTs.
They have a RING domain for E2 recruitment which subsequently transfers ubiquitin via transthioesterification onto a cysteine residue of a RING-like domain
PARK2 is perhaps the most relevant example for neurodegeneration, given that loss of Parkin ubiquitin ligase activity in PD and AD is associated with mitophagy inhibition and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria
One of the main functions of ubiquitin is to label proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome
The 26S proteasome is a multi-protein complex organized into the 19S regulatory cap and the 20S catalytic core which is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of most intracellular and soluble proteins.
The 20S core particle has two outer (α) and two inner (β) rings, with each ring composed of seven subunits.
The catalytically active β-rings which make up the proteolytic region, consists of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases, with threonine functioning as the active nucleophile
These hydrolases include trypsin, chymotrypsin and peptidylglutamyl-peptide
The 19S regulatory lid on the other hand has multiple subunits serving as UBDs for the docking and processing of ubiquitinated substrates by the 20S.
For example, Rpn10 is a 19S regulatory subunit which recognises polyubiquitin chains through its Ubiquitin-Interacting Motif (UIM)
At least 99 DUBs are encoded in the human genome and these have been grouped into the JAMM/MPN, OTU, MJD, UCH, MINDY and ZUP1 subfamilies based on their catalytic domain, with new families still being discovered
Some DUBs, including those from the OTU family, have shown some remarkable specificity towards particular chain types
Rpn11, Ubp6/USP14 and UCH37 are the resident proteasomal DUBs in charge with substrate deubiquitination prior to unfolding and degradation

Ubiquitin signaling and neuronal homeostasis
Neuronal cells communicate through synapses, formed between the axon of a sending neuron and the dendrite of the receiving neuron, with the pre-and postsynaptic membranes separated by the synaptic cleft.
Each of these compartments have a number of cell adhesion molecules and scaffold proteins which enable the release of neurotransmitter from the pre-synaptic density into the synaptic cleft, in response to an action potential
Postsynaptic membranes contain the receptors that bind the released neurotransmitters, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways which regulate synaptic plasticity, learning and memory
Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in mammalian brains and the regulation of its receptors is crucial for neuronal plasticity.
The binding of glutamate onto NMDA (N-methyl Daspartate) receptors (NMDAR), triggers the opening of this ion conductance channel protein, and the influx of calcium.
This increase in intracellular calcium levels is a key signaling event in neurotransmission and therefore it needs to be tighly regulated.
Astrocytes play an important role in this process by metabolising excess extracellular glutamate at synapses
In AD, it has been shown that Aβ can impede the function of neuronal receptors including NMDAR, AMPAR (α-amino-3-hyroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate acid receptor), the Prion Protein cell surface (PrP C ), as well as drive inflammation in astrocytes which further contributes to neurotoxicity
Loss of glutamate homeostasis at synapses leads to the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.
The ensuing excitotoxicity is mediated by the stabilisation and activation of calpain-dependent cleavage of the striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP), the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and neuronal apoptosis
Calcium signaling is intimately linked with ubiquitin ligase function.
For instance, the HECT E3 NEDD4 (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4) binds calcium through its N-terminal calcium-binding module (C2 domain).
In the absence of calcium, the C2 domain binds to the C-terminal HECT domain of NEDD4, inhibiting its ubiquitin ligase activity.
In contrast, the increase in intracellular calcium concentration outcompete this interaction and releases the HECT domain.
NEDD4 then translocates to the plasma membrane where it ubiquitinates synaptic proteins and contributes to neuronal activity
Normal brain function requires a precise and dynamic control over the remodelling of synaptic signaling processes.
Ubiquitin plays key roles in regulating synaptic receptors through proteasomedependent and independent mechanisms
Both NMDA and AMPA receptors are regulated by protein ubiquitination
For example, AMPA receptor surface expression is regulated by the opposing activities of the E3 ligase NEDD4 and the DUB USP8 (Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 8)
The NMDA receptor is a substrate of FBXO2 and MIB2 E3 ligases, and loss of ligase activity disrupts synaptic function
In addition to synaptic receptors, the UPS also regulates the turnover of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95
Another interesting study showed that proteasomes are recruited to synapses, further implicating the UPS as a key regulator of synaptic proteins
Together, these and other studies implicate ubiquitin signaling as an important regulator of the trafficking and turnover of ionotropic glutamate receptors during neuronal activity

Ubiquitin signaling in Alzheimer's Disease

Ubiquitin and protein aggregation
Some of the earliest studies linking UPS dysfunction and AD pathology reported the accumulation of ubiquitin-bound proteins in NFTs
Ubiquitin was also found in neuritic plaques and NFTs in the cortex of AD brains, in Lewy bodies and filaments associated with PD and Pick's disease as well as HD
Furthermore, ubiquitin is detected in both intracellular inclusions as well as extracellular-NFTs (E-NFTs) in AD brains
Components of the proteasome were also found in NFTs in AD and DLB
Whether these represent active or functional proteasomes particles is still unclear.
Importantly, the role and function of protein ubiquitination with regards to aggregate-prone proteins is starting to emerge.
NEDD4 was recently shown to ubiquitinate α-synuclein filaments, suggesting that other protein inclusions might also be targeted by ubiquitin-mediated clearance mechanisms
However, some types of protein aggregates might exert protective functions.
This is the case for inclusion bodies found in HD which are thought to be important to 'soak up' mutant huntingtin elsewhere in neurons, thereby decreasing neuronal toxicity
Similarly, higher order protein conformations seem to sequester the toxic effect of soluble Aβ and Tau
Cryo-EM has emerged as a powerful technique to further our understanding of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration, by providing detailed structural information of the fibril structures of Aβ42
These studies revealed that Tau oligomerisesation and aggregation into NTFs is likely to be disease-specific
It will be interesting to examine the composition of these aggregates in conjuction with quantitative proteomics methods to generate more complete structural models.
Interestingly, there seems to be some preferential enrichment of particular ubiquitin chain types in some protein aggregates.
For instance, Lewy bodies in PD brains are enriched with K29 and K63linked ubiquitin chains
Linear (Met-1) and K48-linked ubiquitin were detected in NTFs and PHFs
However, while K29 chains were found in NFTs
It will be interesting to determine whether more complex ubiquitin chain types such as mixed and branched chains can also be found in some of these proteins inclusions.
Proteomics studies have been useful for the non-biased determination of the protein composition of these aggregates.
For example, Lewy bodies were shown to contain multiple components of the ubiquitin system including E1-conjugating enzyme, the DUBs Otubain 1 and UCLH1, proteasome subunits, SCF E3 ligases and the E4 ubiquitin ligase UBE4B

Crosstalk between Tau, Aβ and ubiquitin signaling
The UPS also plays a role in synaptic plasticity, a vital element of synaptic function, through the ubiquitination of Protein Kinase A (PKA) subunits as well as multiple other synaptic proteins
Reduction in NMDA and AMPA receptor expression is associated with AD and elevated Aβ decreases their surface expression
In fact, a recent study showed that Aβ overexpression mediates the ubiquitination of AMPA receptor and its turnover at the plasma membrane, which leads to synaptic weakening
The underlying mechanisms linking Aβ abnormalities and UPS dysfunction in AD are also becoming clearer.
AD patients exhibit decreased proteasomal activity in the hippocampus, a particularly vulnerable area of the brain during the early stages of the disease
The presence of aggregated proteins has been shown to reduce proteasome function and this is likely exacerbated by Tau and Aβ aggregation
Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that Aβ40 binds to the interior of the proteasome and inhibits the chymotrypsin activity of the 20S catalytic core
In vitro proteasomal assays further confirmed that oligomeric Aβ40-Aβ42 indeed inhibits chymotrypsin but also petidylglutamyl activity
Expression of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2K (E2-25K/HIP-2) is upregulated in neurons exposed to Aβ, and has also been shown to inhibit proteasomal function through its association with mutant ubiquitin UBB+1
In the case of Tau, aggregated species found within PHFs co-immunoprecipitates with proteasome subunits
In addition, proteasomes found in PHFs also appeared to be less active, and in line with this, aggregated Tau inhibited proteasomal activity in AD brain samples.
The E3 ligase CHIP (C-terminus of heat shock protein 70-interacting protein) might contribute to this given that ubiquitination of microtubuleassociated Tau increases its aggregation propensity
Mechanisms leading to loss of function of components of the proteasome have also been proposed in AD.
For example, the proteasome ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 is cleaved by calpain-mediated cleavage following inhibition of the electron transport chain in neurons
Furthermore, the DNA-damage-inducible 1 protein Ddi1, a ubiquitin receptor that aids recruitment of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome, is mutated in early-onset AD
Protein deubiquitination on the proteasome lid is a key step which needs to be tightly coupled to substrate processing and degradation.
However, the proteasomal DUB USP14 can release partially ubiquitinated substrates from the proteasome prematurely and prior to their degradation and this reduces proteasome activity
Excitingly, inhibition of USP14 DUB activity was shown to enhance proteasome activity and improve Tau degradation
In Table

Mutant ubiquitin UBB+1
APP and the ubiquitin gene UBB have been found mutated by a process called molecular misreading.
The resulting mutant protein APP+1 and UBB+1 were found to accumulate in NFTs of frontal and temporal cortices of the hippocampus in AD and Down's Syndrome individuals (Van
Molecular misreading is caused by dinucleotide deletion at GAGAGA sequences in mRNA transcripts, resulting in frame shift and the expression of +1 proteins with an aberrant C-terminus.
In the case of ubiquitin, this results in an uncleavable 19 amino acid extension at the C-terminus of ubiquitin (UBB+1).
Although molecular misreading was first reported in prokaryotic cells, neurons seem particularly prone to such transcriptional error
While low levels of UBB+1 are turned over by the proteasome, its accumulation drives mitochondrial stress and neuronal cell death
UBB+1 accumulation seems disease-specific since it is not found in synucleinopathies
Although UBB+1 does not affect the proteolytic activity of the 20S directly, it inhibits the activity of proteasomal DUBs
UBB+1 cannot be used like wild-type ubiquitin to covalently modify proteins due to the absence of the G76 residue.
However, it can still be ubiquitinated, primarily with mixed K29/K48-linked polyubiquitin chains although other linkages might also be implicated
Interestingly, the toxic potential of the ubiquitinated pools of UBB+1 appears to be different between organisms.
UBB+1 ubiquitination with K29 and K48-linked chains is required for full inhibition of proteolysis in mammalian cells but not in yeast
The finding that Aβ42 increases the expression of the E2-conjugating enzyme E2-25K/Hip2 is particularly interesting given that E2-25K/Hip2 interacts with UBB+1 and drives apoptosis
This study therefore highlights functional links between AD hallmarks and the UPS.

Emerging topics in proteostasis and AD

Mitochondria dysfunction
Mitochondria are the energy generating organelles of all eukaryotic cells by producing ATP molecules through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.
Dysfunction in mitochondria in AD was first suspected through microscopy studies
Since then, most if not all hallmarks of AD, including Aβ, Tau and UBB+1, have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction
Amyloid-β for instance was shown to accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix of neuronal cells from AD transgenic mice
Mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained by multiple pathways including fission and fusion as well as through the removal of damage mitochondria via mitophagy
Increased mitochondrial fragmentation for instance is observed in AD brains and it is associated with Aβ expression.
In fact, Aβ physically interacts with mitochondrial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a protein involved in mitochondrial fission
This results in increased mitochondrial fragmentation which affects mitochondrial dynamics and causes synaptic damage.
Ubiquitin signaling is tighly connected to mitochondrial homeostasis.
For example, the E3 ubiquitin ligase MITOL/MARCH5 regulates Mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1) and Drp1 levels, which in turn impact on mitochondrial dynamics
Loss of MITOL was shown to preserve mitochondrial function during neuronal stress, including during Aβ-induced stress.
The Ring-Between-Ring (RBR) ligase Parkin is perhaps the best studied mitochondrial E3 ligase identified to date.
Parkin and PTEN-induced putative protein kinase 1 (PINK1) form the core components of mitophagy, including in neuronal cells
Mutations in the Parkin gene associated with PD were first identified in 1998
Since then, Parkin mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of a number of additional brain diseases including AD and multiple sclerosis
PINK1 also appears to be important in AD, since restoring its expression lowers Aβ levels and also reduces mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction
The accumulation of damaged mitochondria seen in AD brains, is a result of inadequate Parkin-mediated mitophagy
Recent structure-function studies have revealed how Parkin mutations found in PD affect its ligase activity and function during mitophagy
This is also informative for AD, given that PARK2 mutations have also been found in some individuals with sporadic early-onset AD
Calcium is another major regulator of mitochondrial function which is highly relevant to AD.
The atypical Rho GTPases Miro for example anchors mitochondria to motor proteins and regulates mitochondrial trafficking in a calcium-dependent manner
Under conditions that leads to excess intracellular calcium concentration, just as those observed during excitotoxicity, Miro recruits and is ubiquitinated by Parkin, which drives the removal of damaged mitochondria.
Under these same conditions, Miro depletion prevents Parkin mitochondrial translocation and this protects neurons from glutamate-induced mitophagy
These studies highlight novel crosstalk between calcium signaling, the UPS and mitochondrial function and these are also likely to be relevant in the context of AD.

ER-Mitochondria-Associated Membranes
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as an important network which is tightly connected to most, if not all, membrane-bound organelles including the plasma membrane (PM), peroxisomes, mitochondria, golgi, lipid droplets and endosomes
Contact sites between the ER and mitochondria, known as ER-Mitochondria-Associated Membranes (ER-MAMs), were first visualized under electron microscopy over 60 years ago
ER-MAMs regulate organelle dynamics
At ER-MAMs, ER resident IP3R (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor) interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein VDAC (voltage-dependent anion-selective channel).
Both IP3R and VDAC function as calcium channels, while Grp75 mediates and regulates IP3R-VDAC interactions, thus increasing mitochondrial calcium uptake efficiency
IP3R and VDAC are both substrates of protein ubiquitination, which suggests interesting crosstalks between the ubiquitin system and inter-organelle communication
For example, the E3 ligase MITOL regulates ER-tethering to the mitochondria, through Mitofusin 2 ubiquitination and degradation
ER-MAMs are also highly relevant in AD, with Aβ shown to associate with VDAC1, which enhances its conductance and leads to apoptotic cell death
Recent data also indicate that C99, the APP fragment produced by β-secretase-mediated cleavage, increases at ER-MAMs and interferes with mitochondrial function in a cellular model of AD
The other fragment produced from that cleavage event, Aβ, increases the number of ER-MAMs contact sites which raises mitochondrial calcium levels
The hyperphosphorylated Tau P301L mutant, a hallmark on FTD, is enriched at ER-MAMs which might further explain the mechanisms underlying Tau-mediated mitochondrial toxicity
Together, these and other studies strongly implicate ER-MAMs dysregulation in AD and related dementias

Necroptosis and AD
Apoptotic cell death is the best studied mode of progammed-cell-death in eukaryotes.
It can be triggered by the extrinsic (e.g.
Tumour Necrosis Factor-, Fas Ligand) or intrinsic (e.g.
translocation of BAX to the mitochondrial matrix) pathways, which lead to the activation of caspases.
In AD, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity mediates neuronal apoptosis.
More recently, necroptosis which originally was not believed to be regulated at the molecular level, has emerged as a second mode of programmed-cell-death relevant in AD
Both apoptosis and necroptosis are activated by ligand binding of TNF onto its cognate receptor TNFR1.
Necroptosis likely acts as a fail-safe mechanism for cell death since inactivation of apoptosis is a prerequisite for necroptosis induction.
While apoptotic cells release their content through the form of apoptotic bodies, necroptotic cells directly leak theirs into the extracellular space.
In addition to this phenotypic difference, both cell death pathways are regulated by distinct mechanisms.
In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis does not involve the sequential activation of caspases but rather, it relies on the activation of the ripoptosome, a multi-protein complex which contains serine-threonine kinase receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 and 3 (RIPK1, RIPK3)
RIPK1/K3 converge to induce the phosphorylation of MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like).
Necroptosis culminates in pore formation which is mediated by MLKL, directly and/or indirectly.
In the direct model, MLKL phosphorylation leads to exposure of a 4-helical bundle domain which results in its relocalisation and oligomerization at the PM where pore formation occurs
In contrast, the indirect model suggests that MLKL recruits Ca 2+ channels which increases calcium influx and leads to PM rupture
Recent evidence have reported the upregulation of MLKL and RIPK1 in post-mortem AD brains suggesting that necroptosis is activated in sporadic AD
In support of this, viral-vector mediated expression of MLKL led to more severe cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model, and these effects could be blocked by necrostatin-1, a RIPK1 inhibitor.
Cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and 2) are E3 ligases mediating apoptosis.
In contrast, much less is known regarding the role of ubiquitin in necroptosis.
A recent study reported that expression of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF1 is increased upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced inflammation, and this is accompanied by an increase in the necroptosis marker RIPK1
Examining the therapeutic potential of RIPK1 and of the ubiquitin system could lead to new and exciting approaches for AD.
Encouraging data have shown that the proteasomal inhibitor Carfilzomib prevents ripoptosome complex formation and reduces necroptosis in multiple myeoloma cells, although the exact molecular mechanisms remain to be determined

Targeting the ubiquitin system in AD
The prevailing dogma suggests that maintaining proteostasis throughout life might protect or at least delay age-related disease including AD.
Although the protective effect of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys has been controversial, it nevertheless seems to show some cognitive benefits
Studies in rodents have provided strong evidence to suggest that a decrease in protein synthesis through mTOR inhibition can decrease the toxic effect associated with protein aggregation, while loss of autophagy can cause neurodegeneration in mice
Enhancing autophagy and UPS function have been put forward as promising strategies to maintain neuronal health
In the context of the UPS, this could be achieved through increasing peptidase activity within the proteasomal core.
Alternatively, USP14 inhibition could reduce the premature release of partially deubiquitinated substrates from the proteasome and therefore prevent the accumulation of non-functional proteins
Another strategy could be to increase the recruitment of proteasomal particles to dendritic spines, which are key synaptic contact points where neuronal processes occur
The stimulation of 26S proteasomal activity has also been achieved through the cAMP-PKA-mediated phosphorylation of proteasomal subunits, such as Rpn6/PSMD11, which enhances the degradation of misfolded proteins
Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) act as part of a negative feedback loop to dampen the effect of second messengers.
PDE inhibition, which prolongs the activation of proteasomal function induced by cAMP, has already shown encouraging results in AD mouse models
Another emerging approach is the targeted degradation of specific molecules by proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules (PROTACs)
These molecules have the capacity to recruit the ubiquitin machinery to target specific proteins for degradation
PROTACs are hetero-bifunctional molecules, composed of a linker attached to two ligands.
One ligand recruits the E3 ligase while the other recruits the target protein.
The recruitment of the target protein to the E3 ligase results in its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
In theory, this technology has the potential to utilise the endogenous activity of a whole spectrum of E3 ligases in the mammalian genome to degrade a vast array of target proteins.
Initially, in vivo applications of PROTACs had been problematic due to their poor cellular permeability, but the development of specialised in vivo PROTACs containing poly-arginine tags for improved permeability seem to facilitate the degradation of target proteins
Small molecule based PROTACs have also improved cell permeability over their peptide-based counterparts.
The first small molecule based PROTAC was composed of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 ligand Nutlin and a non steroidal androgen receptor ligand, which efficiently degradaded the androgen receptor
Additional PROTACs have since been developed to degrade Cellular Retinoic Acid-Binding Protein 1 (CRABP1) in neuroblastoma cell lines
Excitingly, Arvinas's Androgen Receptor (AR)-PROTAC TM entered the first phase 1 clinical trials for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2019.
In the context of AD, PROTACs could in theory be developed for the targeted degradation of mutant Tau or of proteases involved in Aβ production.
The latter option is perhaps not straightforward given that Aβ also plays a physiological role in neurons.
However Tau, Aβ and UBB+1 can impede UPS activity, and this might affect the efficacy of PROTACs in AD
Therefore, an approach that combines enhancing proteasomal activity with PROTACs might be necessary to overcome this limitation.
Another mode of targeted protein degradation which could prove useful in AD employs the cytosolic Fc receptor TRIM21 which was recently shown to neutralize misfolded Tau and its associated seeding propensity
These new technologies, and the ability to target -synuclein fibrils, have the potential to change the therapeutic landscape in AD over the next few year.
Finally, the recent development of USP7 inhibitors as novel cancer therapies might also be promising in AD
USP7 deubiquitinates and inactivates MDM2 ligase activity which in turns stabilises p53 and enables cancer cells to survive stress conditions.
It will be interesting to to see how USP7 inhibitors perform in clinical trials and also to explore DUB-based therapies in AD (Table
For instance, USP14 inhibition accelerates the degradation of mutant Tau
Importantly, DUBs and E3s likely have multiple substrates and the specificity of the mechanisms targeted will need to be closely monitored

Concluding remarks
Despite the discovery of protein inclusions in the brain of patients with AD over a century ago, there is still no cure available.
GWAS studies have been useful to identify biomarkers in familial cases, but the molecular mechanisms that initiate and drive AD remain elusive.
Determining the properties and function of A and Tau in normal brain homeostasis and AD has been a focus for many years and it now appears that soluble intermediate oligomers, rather than protein aggregates may well be the toxic species.
AD and other brain proteinopathies have been associated with loss of proteostasis and the decrease in proteasomal function and autophagy contribute to this process.
The brain seems to be particularly reliant on these pathways to maintain homeostasis, which likely reflects the inability of neurons to divide or replenish following injury.
In this chapter, we have summarised some the evidence linking dysregulation in ubiquitin signaling and AD, including crosstalk between Tau, A and the UPS.
We have also highlighted new ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms and in particular how changes in deubiquitinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases activity impact on synaptic and cognitive function.
Neuronal necroptosis, mitochondrial homeostasis and calcium signaling at ER-MAMs have all emerged as exciting new fields of research relevant for AD.
It will be interesting to determine how the writers (i.e.
E1, E2, E3s), readers (i.e.
UBDs) and erasers (i.e.
DUBs) of the ubiquitin code impact on these mechanisms during healthy and pathological brain aging.
Technological advances including cryo-EM, quantitative proteomics, single molecule microscopy as well as improved in vitro and in vivo AD models will be instrumental in further defining how such proteinopathies initiate and develop.
This fundamental knowledge should then feed into drug development with the aim to open new therapeutic avenues for AD.
