Non-invasive 40-Hz Light Flicker Ameliorates Alzheimer’s-Associated Rhythm Disorder via Regulating Central Circadian Clock in Mice
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients often exhibit perturbed circadian rhythm with fragmented sleep before disease onset.
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of a 40-Hz light flicker on circadian rhythm in an AD mouse model (APP/PS1).
Locomotor rhythms recordings were conducted to examine the circadian clock rhythm in APP/PS1 mice.
Molecular biology analyses, including western blot and real-time qPCR assays, were conducted to assess the changes in circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1), and period 2 (PER2).
In addition to determining the direct effect of a 40-Hz light flicker on hypothalamic central clock, whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was employed to record individual neurons of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) sections.
The results reported herein demonstrate that a 40-Hz light flicker relieves circadian rhythm disorders in APP/PS1 mice and returns the expression levels of key players in the central circadian clock, including Clock, Bmal1, and Per2, to baseline.
Moreover, the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in SCN neurons is significantly lower in APP/PS1 mice than in the control, and the amplitude of sIPSCs is decreased.
Exposure to a 40-Hz light flicker significantly increases the sIPSC frequency in SCN neurons of APP/PS1 mice, with little effect on the amplitude.
However, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) are both unaffected by a 40-Hz light flicker.
The data suggest that a 40-Hz light flicker can ameliorate AD-associated circadian rhythm disorders, presenting a new type of therapeutic treatment for rhythm disorders caused by AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease is a neurogenic disease presenting with dementia.
The main pathological features of AD include the deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and the buildup of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
The primary symptoms of AD are severe progressive cognitive deficits, gradual memory loss, and circadian rhythm disturbances.
Circadian disturbances have been reported in approximately 45% of AD patients
Frequent nighttime awakening and excessive daytime naps greatly affect the quality of life of patients, family members, and caregivers
More importantly, circadian rhythm disturbances may represent preclinical preceding overt cognitive symptoms and memory loss
Recent studies suggest that disrupted circadian rhythms may be a principal component of the causal pathway, leading to AD pathogenesis and progression
Circadian rhythm refers to the biological tendency of the body to operate in 24-h cycles.
The circadian rhythm system is commonly affected in many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), and diffuse Lewy body (DLB) dementia
The central clock supporting circadian rhythmic behavior, including wake and sleep, is positioned in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamic forebrain.
As the central pacemaker, the SCN receives light information from the retina and transmits the synchronization signal to peripheral clocks in different parts of the body, such as the liver, heart, and adipose tissue, in order to regulate cellular and physiological functions
SCN transplantation from younger animals can restore multiple circadian rhythm and the life span of aged animals
The rhythm's output is presently thought to depend primarily on the transcriptiontranslation feedback loop, which consists of clock-controlled genes and a series of clock genes.
Brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 and period 2 (PER2) are the core constituents of the transcriptiontranslation feedback loop and are closely related to circadian rhythm maintenance.
Previous studies indicate that mice lacking the Bmal1 gene become arrhythmic when passing from a light-dark (LD) cycle to constant darkness (DD)
Additionally, Per2 -/-mice have shown a significant interruption of the rhythm of running activity
Circadian rhythm disorders can manifest in a number of ways, with the most obvious change being the sleepwake cycle.
Patients with neurodegenerative diseases often observe irregular sleep-wake cycles, and they tend to sleep multiple times within 24 h.
Patients report symptoms of insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and excessive sleepiness during the day
The increase in sleepiness during the day is linked to a high risk of dementia
The manifestation of circadian rhythm disorders in patients of AD is associated with the deposition of Aβ
Circadian rhythm disorders and Aβ deposition were observed in the brain of 5ÕFAD mice, and 5ÕFAD mice are also used as an AD model
However, there is a lack of therapy for circadian rhythm disorders caused by AD.
Understanding the relationship between AD and circadian rhythm disorders is important for the improvement of AD treatment.
Timely detection of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders can provide biomarkers of AD, which can be used as treatment targets or to monitor disease progression.
Light therapy has proven effective in improving sleep disturbances caused by neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD
It has been reported that light therapy can restore melatonin production and relieve clinical circadian disturbances
However, there are no clear guidelines available for light therapy in AD-associated circadian disturbances
In 2016, a study reported that using a 40-Hz light flicker can induce 40-Hz gamma oscillation and inhibit the production of Aβ in a mouse model of AD
A 40-Hz light flicker activated microglia, accelerating the removal of existing amyloid deposition
This light treatment provides a promising therapeutic application; however, limited information is available on whether a 40-Hz light flicker could be effective in improving AD-associated circadian rhythm disorders.
Our study aimed to examine how a 40-Hz light flicker affects the circadian rhythm using APP/PS1 mice, a well-characterized model of AD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and Housing
Adult (female, age 8 months) APP/PS1 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, with their non-transgenic wildtype (WT) littermates as control.
Female WT mice were divided randomly into two groups (n = 10 per group): A control group (control) and a 40-Hz light flicker group (40 Hz).
APP/PS1 mice were divided randomly into two groups (n = 10 per group): An APP/PS1 group (APP/PS1) and an APP/PS1 plus 40-Hz light flicker group (APP/PS1 + 40 Hz).
Mice were housed under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (temperature ∼25 • C; humidity ∼40%).
The experiment procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shenzhen University (resolution number, 2017003).
All efforts were made to reduce animal suffering.

Light Irradiation
Based on the phase response curve of light reported previously, light stimulation in the morning induces phase advances in humans
In our study, the mice in the 40 Hz and APP/PS1 + 40 Hz groups were exposed to light (LED, centroid wavelength = 462.8
nm, Tc ≥ 25,000 K, timefrequency modulation frequency = 40 Hz, irradiation power density = 0.3 mW/cm 2 ) at 8:00 a.m., 1 h for 30 days (Supplementary Figure
Mice are confined in their cages and had access to food and water ad libitum.
A 40-Hz light flicker covers the entire cage (Supplementary Figure
After the last light exposure, the mice were euthanized, and their hypothalami and hippocampus tissues were collected and stored at -80 • C for subsequent analysis.

Western Blot Assays
The samples of mice were collected within 1 h after a 40-Hz light flicker.
The brain was quickly and cautiously placed in cold saline (0.9%), and the hypothalamus (including the SCN) and hippocampus were dissected immediately on a cold plate surface and subsequently weighed and homogenized using a RIPA reagent (Sigma).
The homogenate was subjected to 3,000 rpm of centrifugation for 30 min at 4 • C.
After which, the supernatant portion was collected for further analysis.
BCA assay (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) was used to determine protein concentrations.
SDS/PAGE electrophoresis was used to separate the protein lysates which were then transferred onto PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany).
Antibodies used in Western blot analysis were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, United States) unless otherwise indicated.
Product numbers and antibody dilutions are indicated in parentheses.
The membranes were incubated at 4 • C overnight after 1 h of blocking using 5% milk.
The following antibodies were used: BMAL1 (ab228594, 1:1,000), CLOCK (ab3517, 1:1,000), GAPDH (ab181602, 1:1,000), and PER2 (Millipore, AB2202, 1:1,000).
Then the membrane was further incubated with a 1:5,000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h (ab6721).
The target protein was visualized using Clarity ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and was quantified through densitometry with the Bio-Rad Quantity One software.

RNA Isolation and Real-Time qPCR
An RNA extraction kit (MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit, TaKaRa, Dalian, China) was used to extract the total mRNA.
The PrimeScript RT Master Mix reverse-transcription kit was used to reverse RNA into cDNA, and this was after evaluation of purity of the extracted RNA.
Real-time PCR with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) on an Analytik Jena QPCR System was used to determine the relative gene expression.
The comparative threshold cycle ( Ct) was used for the quantification of the relative expression of mRNA.
The housekeeping gene (GAPDH) was used as control.
The specific primers for gene expression analysis are shown in Table

Locomotor Rhythms Recording
Adult (female, age 8 months) APP/PS1 mice (n = 3) and their non-transgenic WT littermates (n = 3) were used for recording.
Mice were individually housed within PhenoTyper 3000 cages (installed with a light flicker), and they were allowed ad libitum access to food and water.
EthoVision XT is the applied video tracking software that tracks and analyzes the behavior,

movement, and activity of any animal.
EthoVision XT V14 was used to record and analyze locomotor behavior.
Spontaneous locomotor activity was defined as the moving distance per unit time (3 min).
Mice were videotaped for 3 days, and the locomotor rhythms recordings were analyzed as control and APP/PS1.
For the following 30 days (due to the limitation of the recording time of the system, the data of 12 days are displayed), mice were given 40-Hz light flicker treatment, and their locomotor rhythms recordings were analyzed as 40 Hz and APP/PS1 + 40 Hz.

Measurement of Body Weight, Heart Rate, and Fasting Blood Glucose Level
Mice were weighted before and after 30 days of 40-Hz light flicker treatment.
The heart rate of anesthetized mice was measured by a Vevo 2100 system (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada).
Fasting blood glucose level was detected from the tail vein after 8 h of fasting using an automated glucometer (GM100; Bionime GmbH, Berneck, Switzerland).

Visual Evoked Potential
Mice were dark-adapted, their pupils dilated, and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).
Visual evoked potential was performed using a RETIport/scan 21 recorder (Roland Consult, Wiesbaden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Necropsy and Slice Preparation
The mice were first anesthetized with isoflurane.
To perform craniotomy, the brain was quickly removed, followed by isolation of the tissue block containing SCN.
The tissue block was then transferred to a cutting solution (ice-cold) containing (in mM) 30 CaCl, 194 sucrose, 1 MgCl 2 , 4.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO 3 , and 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , aerated by a mix of 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 gases.
A ceramic blade (Camden Instruments Ltd.) joined to a vibratome tissue slicer (VT1200 S, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to obtain coronal sections that were 300 µm thick.
The slices were then equilibrated in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 33 • C for 1 h and then kept at room temperature.

Slice Electrophysiology
The brain sections were moved to a recording chamber attached to an upright microscope stage and perfused continuously (after stabilization using an overlying platinum ring) to maintain the solution at 28-32

Statistical Analyses
Data were reported as mean ± SD of no less than three separate experiments.
Statistical analysis was conducted by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) and with Tukey's post hoc test.
An least significant difference (LSD) t-test was used for comparison between groups.
Statistically significant differences between groups were defined at p < 0.05.
All of the analyses were completed with GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA, United States).

RESULTS
A 40-Hz Light Flicker Alleviates the Circadian Rhythm Disorders in APP/PS1 Mice
Evaluations of spontaneous motor activity patterns under standard light and dark conditions (LD12:12) were performed on WT and APP/PS1 mice to determine circadian rhythm function at baseline.
In our study, the mice were exposed to a 40-Hz light flicker at 8 a.m. for 1 h in a special cage (Supplementary Figure
Under the condition of LD12:12, control group mice were more active in the dark than in the light, and occasionally, there was activity in the light phase (Figures
The daily exercise rhythm of the LD12:12 photoperiod showed stable diurnal activity.
However, APP/PS1 mice lose the irregular daily activityrest cycle, with their rest phase being much more fragmented compared to that of control group mice (Figures
The results are consistent with those of a previous study
Spontaneous locomotor activities during the light phase were significantly prolonged; by contrast, activities at dark were significantly reduced compare to those of control group mice (686 ± 91 cm in the light and 644 ± 268 cm in the dark).
Interestingly, increased regular locomotor activity was observed after a 40-Hz light flicker in AD mice (Figure
And spontaneous locomotor activities in APP/PS1 + 40 Hz group mice were significantly decreased in the light and increased in the dark compared to those of APP/PS1 group mice (304 ± 33 cm in the light and 1,242 ± 298 cm in the dark).
Percentages of the locomotor activity in the dark (12 h) to total activity (24 h) in the control group, APP/PS1 group, and APP/PS1 + 40 Hz group were 94 ± 2, 48 ± 16, and 83 ± 3, respectively.
Compared to that in the APP/PS1 group, the percentage of the locomotor activity in the dark (12 h) to total activity (24 h) was significantly increased in the APP/PS1 + 40 Hz group (Figure
These results suggest that the fragmented rest phase of AD mice has been restored greatly and that a 40-Hz light flicker alleviates circadian rhythm disorders in APP/PS1 mice.

A 40-Hz Light Flicker Has Little Effect on the Normal Physiological Status of Mice
We assessed the effect of a 40-Hz light flicker on basic physiological parameters, including body weight, heart rate, and fasting blood glucose levels.
The results showed that there was no significant difference in mouse weight before (20.75 ± 0.77 g) and after (19.7 ± 0.9 g) a 40-Hz light flicker (Figure
Similarly, there were no significant differences in the fasting blood glucose levels (7.0 ± 0.7 and 6.8 ± 0.9 mM) and heart rate (611.6 ± 22.6 and 616.6 + 30.8) before and after a 40-Hz light flicker (Figures
Our results suggested that a 40-Hz light flicker did not affect the body weight, heart rate, and blood glucose levels of the mice.

A 40-Hz Light Flicker Has Little Impact on Retinal Electrophysiology in Mice
The light that enters the hypothalamus regulates the central circadian clock and synchronizes the peripheral clocks.
In this study, we hypothesize that a 40-Hz light flicker might have an impact on retinal function.
The physiological function of retinal ganglion cells can be evaluated by examining visual evoked potentials (VEPs).
VEPs detect light conduction of retinal ganglion cells to the visual center, and the peak amplitude difference (N1-P1) reflects the visual response.
Interestingly, we did not observe significant changes in the amplitude of P1-N1 when comparing the control group (5.5 ± 0.7 µV) with the 40-Hz light flicker group (6.0 ± 1 µV) (Figure
A 40-Hz light flicker did not disturb the mouse retinal function significantly.
Our results suggest that short exposure to a 40-Hz light flicker had little impact on basic physiological functions.
A 40-Hz Light Flicker Induced Gamma Power of Cortical ECoG and Reduced Aβ and Tau Production in the Hippocampus of APP/PS1 Mice It was reported that a 40-Hz light flicker improved altered gamma in multiple brain regions and inhibited the production of Aβ
We tested in APP/PS1 mice and observed that a 40-Hz light flicker induced the gamma in the  visual cortex (Figure
We next assessed the effect of a 40-Hz light flicker on APP and tau protein levels in the hippocampus.
The results show that 40-Hz light flicker treatment significantly decreased protein expressions of APP and phosphorylated tau in comparison with those of APP/PS1 mice (100 ± 8.13, 100 ± 6.04, and 100 ± 3.04 in the APP/PS1 group and 70.14 ± 11.26, 66.56 ± 4.99, and 70.26 ± 2.76 in APP/PS1 + 40 Hz group, respectively) (Figure
The Aβ is processed by β-secretase cleavage of APP to produce β-CTF; we also found that β-CTF was significantly reduced with a 40-Hz light flicker compared to the APP/PS1 group (100 ± 12.96 in the APP/PS1 group and 44.25 ± 11.02 in the APP/PS1 + 40 Hz group) (Figure

A 40-Hz Light Flicker Restores the Expression Levels of Key Central Clock Proteins in the SCN of APP/PS1 Mice
A 40-Hz light flicker improved the circadian rhythm behavior of APP/PS1 mice.
This finding suggests that a 40-Hz light flicker could affect and change the physiological function of the central circadian pacemaker, the SCN.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of daily 1-h exposure to a 40-Hz light flicker on clock gene expression in the SCN of APP/PS1 mice.
We found that the hypothalami of APP/PS1 mice have a significant reduction of the Bmal1, Clock, and Per2 mRNA levels compared to those of control mice (1 ± 0.13, 1 ± 0.08, and 1 ± 0.28 in the control group and 0.36 ± 0.26, 0.44 ± 0.08, and 0.29 ± 0.15 in the APP/PS1 group, respectively) (Figure
It is interesting that the mRNA levels (0.97 ± 0.13, 0.88 ± 0.10, and 1.4 ± 0.11, respectively) were partly restored with a 40-Hz light flicker (Figure
Single 40-Hz light flicker administration showed no effects on the mRNA levels of Bmal1 (1.30 ± 0.30), Clock (1.23 ± 0.22), and Per2 (1.32 ± 0.16) compared with the control group.
To further evaluate the protein expression levels of BMAL1, CLOCK, and PER2, we performed western blotting analysis.
A significant reduction in the expression of BMAL1 (91.89 ± 1.7), CLOCK (68.73 ± 1.2), and PER2 (69.84 ± 2.77) proteins was also found in APP/PS1 mice (Figure
In contrast, 40-Hz light flicker treatment significantly increased protein expressions of BMAL1 (105.72 ± 2.2), CLOCK (97.2 ± 1.7), and PER2 (100.5 ± 2.31) in comparison with APP/PS1 mice (Figure
These results indicate that a 40-Hz light flicker regulated the Bmal1, Clock, and Per2 protein expressions in the hypothalami of APP/PS1 mice.
A 40-Hz Light Flicker Stimulated the Amplitude of sIPSC and Frequency of sEPSC on SCN Neurons in APP/PS1 Mice Given that expression of key circadian genes was changed in the hypothalami of APP/PS1 mice exposed to a 40-Hz light flicker, we monitored the physiological function of SCN cells.
Whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed in individual central clock neurons from acutely prepared coronal SCN slices from APP/PS1 mice receiving a 40-Hz light flicker and from WT mice (Figure
The membrane resistance, including both sIPSCs and sEPSCs, was recorded as the response variable.
Notably, AD mice have perturbed physiology of the central clock neuron with less spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic firing rate (Figure
The frequency of sIPSCs in central clock neurons was significantly decreased with a lower firing amplitude in APP/PS1 mice compared with that in the control group (1.4 ± 0.3 Hz and 177.9 ± 25.2 pA in the control group and 0.3 ± 0.1 Hz and 92.7 ± 15.9 pA in the APP/PS1 group).
Interestingly, a 40-Hz light flicker restored the frequency of sIPSCs in SCN neurons significantly in APP/PS1 mice but had little effects on firing amplitude (1.3 ± 0.2 Hz and 89.3 ± 8.2 pA in the APP/PS1 + 40 Hz group) (Figures
In contrast, SCN neurons of APP/PS1 mice (51.8 ± 8.6 pA and 0.6 ± 0.09 Hz) exhibited reduced sEPSC amplitude with no significant change in firing frequency compared with those of control animals (101.5 ± 6.4 pA and 0.7 ± 0.09 Hz) (
However, a 40-Hz light flicker stimulated the sEPSC frequency (1.0 ± 0.09 Hz) without affecting the neuronal firing amplitude (48.2 ± 10.6 pA) (Figures
This suggests that the basal inhibitory tone was increased in the central clock neurons of APP/PS1 mice.

DISCUSSION
Abnormal deposition of Aβ, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and loss of neuronal cells are typical pathological changes observed in AD patients
Managing AD is currently in a limited pharmacotherapy stage.
Currently, the AD drugs used in clinical therapy are limited to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists
However, these drugs can only relieve certain symptoms without altering or delaying the progression of AD.
Therefore, new AD therapies are urgently needed.
Recently, there has been experimental evidence that 40-Hz light flickering could cure AD by inducing 40-Hz gamma oscillations and inhibiting the production of Aβ in an AD mouse model
This effect is only observed for light flickered at the frequency of 40 Hz.
Constant light and 20-Hz, 80-Hz, or random light flickers exhibit insignificant effects on Aβ levels
In this study, we show that the 40-Hz light flicker ameliorates circadian rhythm disorder in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model by reducing the deposition of Aβ in the hypothalamus and increasing the rhythmic expression of clock proteins, such as BMAL1, CLOCK, and PER2.
After 30 days of 40-Hz-flickering light treatment, no adverse effects on mouse body weight, blood glucose level, heart rate, and biological rhythm were observed.
Previously, it had been shown that Aβ deposition can directly drive impaired sleep in animals
Based on the results of the wheel-running activity assay, mice injected with Aβ31-35 in the hippocampus exhibit obvious circadian rhythm abnormalities with significantly longer free-running periods than those in the control
Herein, we show that 40-Hz light flickering can improve diurnal activity in mice.
Specifically, pretreatment with 40-Hz-flickered light alleviates the irregular daily activity/rest cycle in APP/PS1 mice suffering from circadian rhythm disorders and restores the ratio of nocturnal to total activity.
This indicates that the fragmented rest phase in AD mice is greatly restored by 40-Hz light flicker treatment, and this treatment effectively alleviates circadian rhythm disorders in APP/PS1 mice.
The term "circadian rhythm" is generally used to describe a variety of periodically changing physiological and biochemical activities in different organisms
The circadian regulation is accomplished through the central oscillator in the SCN
SCN is the mammalian circadian rhythm center that integrates external rhythmic stimuli, such as external light, environmental temperature, and food, in a continuous circadian rhythm of approximately 24 h, thereby regulating the diurnal variation of physiological activities
The daily rhythm of SCN is regulated by a transcription and translation feedback loop system involving clock genes like Clock, Bmal1, and Per2.
At present, we do not know whether the restored electrophysiology of SCN neurons is due to the direct effect of light stimulation or reduced amyloid deposition in other parts of the brain.
However, a recent study shows that the effect of 40-Hz light flicker in reducing the amyloid level is mediated by enhanced amyloid endocytosis in the microglia
Generally, the function of the microglia is regulated by the sleep-wake cycle, and the injury response of these cells is reduced in the awake brain
We speculate that a 40-Hz light flicker directly stimulates central clock neurons, improves circadian rhythm, restores activity-rest cycle, and boosts microglial amyloid surveillance in AD animals.
To confirm this hypothesis, investigations of the microglia function in SCN-damaged AD mice are needed.
Overall, the results reported herein and those published previously indicate that the restoration of the circadian rhythm is necessary for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and that light stimulation constitutes a promising therapeutic technique.
Based on a previous study, the AD mice tested herein were subjected to daily treatment (1 h/day) with 40-Hz flashing light for 30 days
In the future, the effect of 40-Hz light flickering on human AD models should be studied in order to establish clinical applications of the proposed light therapy.
The timing and duration of light exposure are key variables affecting therapeutic efficiency, and thus, they should be optimized and controlled, especially considering that inappropriately timed light will likely worsen the symptoms of circadian rhythm disorder
It should be noted that the 40-Hz light flicker therapy experiments performed herein were scheduled at 8:00 a.m., the beginning of the natural light phase.
However, little is known about the time or duration of phototherapy required to clinically treat AD.
Further study should be carried to test whether a similar effect could be observed in humans considering that mice are nocturnal animals.
Timed exposure is inconvenient, and as with any lifestyle change, compliance can be a major issue.
Measurements of core body temperature or endogenous melatonin rhythms allow for the assessment of the circadian phase, which in turn permits the time scheduling needed to increase the efficiency of clinical AD treatment
In the future, we shall study the effect of timing of 40-Hz light stimulation on melatonin secretion.
The effects of the spectral characteristics of light, such as wavelength, frequency, intensity, and temperature, should also be tested.

CONCLUSION
Our research demonstrated that a 40-Hz light flicker (40 Hz, 462.8 nm, at 8:00 a.m., 1-h) for 30 days improves fragmented locomotor activity-rest cycle in APP/PS1 mice and reduces the deposition of Aβ.
It also alters the expression of key circadian proteins and restores the electrophysiological changes in the hypothalamus of AD mice.
This indicates that a 40-Hz light flicker might be a potential candidate to treat the rhythm disorder in AD.
