TDP-43 inhibitory peptide alleviates neurodegeneration and memory loss in an APP transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, characterized clinically by progressive decline in cognitive function and neuropathologically by the presence of senile plaques and neuronal loss in the brain.
While current drugs for AD are always employed as symptomatic therapies with variable benefits, there is no treatment to delay its progression or halt neurodegeneration.
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy has increasingly been implicated as a prominent histopathological feature of AD and related dementias.
Our recent studies have implicated mitochondria as critical targets of TDP-43 neurotoxicity.
Here, we demonstrate that the suppression of mitochondrial-associated TDP-43 protects against neuronal loss and behavioral deficits in 5XFAD transgenic mice recapitulating AD-related phenotypes.
In AD patients and 5XFAD mice, the level of TDP-43 is increased in mitochondria, and TDP-43 highly co-localizes with mitochondria in brain neurons exhibiting TDP-43 proteinopathy.
Chronic administration of a TDP-43 mitochondrial localization inhibitory peptide, PM1, significantly alleviates TDP-43 proteinopathy, mitochondrial abnormalities, microgliosis and even neuronal loss without effect on amyloid plaque load in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice well after the onset of symptoms.
Additionally, PM1 also improves the cognitive and motor function in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice and completely prevents the onset of mild cognitive impairment in 6-month-old 5XFAD mice.
These data indicate that mitochondria-associated TDP-43 is likely involved in AD pathogenesis and that the inhibitor of mitochondria-associated TDP-43 may be a valuable drug to treat underlying AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly, characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in brain regions critical for memory and cognition, along with the pathologic hallmarks, senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), in which amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and tau are the main components, respectively
Currently, there is no effective treatment for AD.
Genetic mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is the second most common form of early-onset dementia
TDP-43 proteinopathy, usually referred to as cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation, is a prominent histopathological feature of degenerating neurons in patients with ALS or FTD
In fact, increasing evidence indicates that TDP-43 proteinopathy may represent a key pathological feature in common dementias, including the clinical syndrome of AD and related dementia syndromes
More importantly, TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with AD-type dementia independent of NFTs and SPs, and patients with mixed TDP-43, Aβ, and tau proteinopathies show more severe AD-type dementia than patients with Aβ and tau proteinopathies alone
Despite an expanding body of evidence implicating the important role of TDP-43 in AD and related dementia, the role of TDP-43 proteinopathy in disease progression is largely unknown and little attempt has been taken to investigate the possibility of targeting TDP-43 for the treatment of these devastating diseases.
Previous studies have repeatedly showed abnormal mitochondrial morphology
This notion is further supported by evidence showing that TDP-43 or truncated forms of TDP-43 can be present in either the inside or outside of mitochondria
Among these studies, most recent study and we have independently found that the portion of full-length TDP-43 inside of mitochondria can bind mitochondria-transcripted messenger RNA (mRNAs) encoding subunits (ND3/6) of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I to specifically impair its assembly and function
We have shown that TDP-43 accumulates in mitochondria in ALS and FTD patients, and that the suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization can prevent neuronal death and behavioral deficits in TDP-43 transgenic mice for ALS and FTD
So far, there is few study of TDP-43 in mitochondria in AD.
Here, we examined the localization and expression of TDP-43 in degenerating neurons in AD patients and 5XFAD transgenic mice recapitulating AD-related phenotypes
To investigate the contribution of mitochondria-associated TDP-43 to AD progression, we further studied the therapeutic effects of a TDP-43 mitochondrial localization inhibitory peptide on mitochondria, neurodegeneration, and cognitive function in both aged and young 5XFAD mice.

Materials and methods

Animals and treatments
Mouse surgery and procedures were performed according to NIH guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Case Western Reserve University.
All aged NTG and 5XFAD female mice (B6SJL-Tg (APPSwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V) 6799Vas/Mmjax, stock no.
34840-JAX) used in behavioral tests were born at the same day, directly purchased from the Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers (MMRRC) and maintained at Case Western Reserve University.
The cohort of young NTG and 5XFAD mice was generated and maintained at Case Western Reserve University, weaned on postnatal day 30 and genotyped by PCR analysis of DNA extracted from an ear punch.
Detailed mouse age and gender information for each experiment is presented in specific figure legends.
cPM and PM1 peptides fused to the C terminus of the protein transduction domain (YGRKKRRQRRR) of the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein to enhance peptide delivery and permeability as described
For peptide infusion, mini osmotic pumps (Alzet model 1004, flow rate of 0.11 μL/hr) were filled with 100 μL PBS containing cPM or PM1 peptides (0.5 mg/kg/day) followed by pump incubation in PBS at 37°C overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions.
After isoflurane anesthesia, mini osmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously in the back of each mouse.
After treatment, mice were transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS and brain tissues were collected.

Behavioral tests
All mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral assessments including motor tasks (open field test), body coordination tasks (rotarod and footprint test), muscle strength (grip strength test) and cognitive tasks (Barnes maze test for long-term spatial memory).
To avoid habituation, individual mice were tested for these behavioral tasks on each test day in the following order: day 1-4 for rotarod and grip strength test, day 5 for open field test and day 6-10 for Barnes maze test.
All tests were performed at the Case Behavior Core, with the investigator blinded to both mouse genotype and treatment group.
Before the rotarod testing, mice received 3 training trials per day for 3 days by placing them on the Rota-Rod (Panlab/ Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) with gradually increased cylinder speeds from 4 rpm to 12 rpm.
On the testing day, the maximal latency to fall off was recorded in the rotarod set to the accelerating mode (speed increasing from 4 to 40 rpm in 5 minutes).
For the muscular strength measurement, the two forepaws of a mouse were placed on a grid with the two hindpaws placed on a bar that was connected to a grip strength test meter (Bioseb, Vitrolles, France) for 5 trials.
The single best recorded value was collected for statistical analysis.
The open field test used a 50cm long square plastic apparatus closed with 50cm high walls with the activity recorded continually for 10 minutes by ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting Co. Wood Dale, IL).
The footprint tests were performed using a customized runway with 50 cm long, 5 cm wide and both sides bordered as we described
The Barnes maze consisted of a white acrylic circular disk 92 cm in diameter with 20 equally spaced holes (5cm in diameter) located 2 cm from the edge of the disk.
The maze was illuminated by two 60W lamps to provide an aversive, bright disk surface.
An acrylic escape box (7 × 7 × 5 cm) could be fitted under any of the holes in the maze.
The maze was raised 30 cm from the floor and rested on a pedestal that enabled it to be rotated 360° on a horizontal plane.
An acrylic start bin with 15 cm diameter and 15 cm height was used.
Trials were recorded using a webcam and analyzed by video tracking software (EthoVision XT, Noldus, Leesburg, VA).
Each trial began with the start bin positioned in the center of the maze with the mouse placed inside.
The mouse remained in the start bin for 30 seconds, providing a standard starting context for each trial and ensuring that initial orientation of the mouse in the maze varied randomly from trial to trial.
Each mouse was allowed to explore the maze freely for 2 minutes.
After the mouse entered the escape hole, the mouse was left in the escape box for 90 seconds before being returned to its home cage.
If the mouse did not enter the escape box within 120 seconds, it was gently picked up by the experimenter and placed over the target hole and allowed to enter the escape box.
After each trial, the maze and escape box were cleaned carefully with a 10% alcohol solution to dissipate odor cues and provide a standard olfactory context.
Five training sessions consisting of two trials each were run on subsequent days and escape latencies were measured.

Mitochondrial isolation
Brain tissues were homogenized in IB-1 solution (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]), followed by centrifugation at 600 g for 5 min to remove nuclear contaminants and unbroken cells.
The supernatant was further centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min and at 9,000 g for 10 min.
The pellet was then washed two times in IB-2 solution (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]) and resuspended in mitochondria resuspending buffer (MRB) (250 mM mannitol, 5 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], and 0.5 mM EGTA).
The resuspended fraction was overlaid on top of 4 mL Percoll medium (225 mM mannitol, 25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 1 mM EGTA, and 30% Percoll [v/v]) and centrifuged at 95,000 g in a SW50.1 rotor for 30 minutes at 4°C.
The purified mitochondrial fraction was collected and resuspended in a 10-fold volume of MRB and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,300 g to obtain purified mitochondria.

Results

TDP-43 is augmented in the mitochondria of AD patients and 5XFAD transgenic mice
We first investigated the colocalization of TDP-43 with mitochondria in neurons of human cortex tissue from AD cases and age-matched normal individuals by double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies specific to TDP-43 and outer mitochondrial membrane marker Tom20.
Cortical neurons in control cases demonstrated mainly nuclear TDP-43 localization, yet cortical neurons in the AD cases showed characteristic increased cytoplasmic TDP-43 (Fig.
Notably, cytoplasmic TDP-43 in AD cortical neurons significantly colocalized with mitochondria (Fig.
Immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) analysis of isolated highly purified mitochondria with well-preserved membranes from human cortical tissues showed TDP-43 predominantly in the inner mitochondrial membrane cristae not overlapping with Aβ labeling in all AD and control samples (Fig.
Mitochondria from AD cortices demonstrated greater TDP-43 labeling than those from age-matched controls (Fig.
Consistently, immunoblot analysis revealed that there was indeed a significantly higher expression of TDP-43 in purified mitochondria from AD than age-matched controls, while the levels of TDP-43 in total tissue lysate remained unchanged (Fig.
Significant cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation could be noted selectively in neurons of the subiculum and cortex but not in the hippocampus CA1 of 9-month-old 5XFAD mice (Supplementary Fig.
Similar to the findings in AD patients, cytoplasmic TDP-43 highly colocalized with mitochondria in neurons of 5XFAD mice (Fig.
Whereas all mice displayed comparable expression of total TDP-43, 5XFAD mice demonstrated significantly higher levels of TDP-43 in purified mitochondria than age-matched non-transgenic (NTG) littermates (Fig.
As another feature of TDP-43 proteinopathy, phosphorylated TDP-43 positive inclusions could be observed in the cytoplasm of both AD patient and 5XFAD mouse, and found greatly colocalized with mitochondria (Fig.

Alleviation of TDP-43 proteinopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities in aged 5XFAD mice by inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization
TDP-43 mitochondrial localization depends on its M1 motif, the deletion of which suppresses its mitochondrial accumulation without significant effect on its half-life, dimerization, functional binding to mRNA targets, and expression of cytosolic, nuclear, or total TDP-43
The synthesized peptide PM1 (YGRKKRRQRRRAQFPGACGL) in which the M1 motif was fused to the TAT peptide (GRKKRRQRRR), competitively inhibits TDP-43 mitochondrial localization and abolishes TDP-43-induced toxicity on mitochondria and neurons without affecting on total or nuclear TDP-43 expression
We next determined whether increased expression of TDP-43 in mitochondria in aged 5XFAD mice after the appearance of TDP-43 proteinopathy and neuronal loss could be reversed by PM1. 10 months old 5XFAD transgenic mice were subcutaneously infused with either PM1 or control cPM peptide at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day continuously for 4 weeks followed by a 2week washout period to eliminate the potential effect of the treatment (Fig.
We confirmed that PM1, as indicated by TAT staining, reached the central nervous system (Supplementary Fig.
After PM1 peptide infusion, TDP-43 cytoplasmic accumulation in the subiculum was significantly reduced and TDP-43 was predominantly restricted to the nucleus (Supplementary Fig.
In addition, phosphorylated TDP-43 positive inclusions were rarely seen in aged 5XFAD mice with PM1 infusion (data now shown), together suggesting that the suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization is sufficient to reverse TDP-43 proteinopathy in 5XFAD mice.
Within mitochondria, TDP-43 binds mitochondria-transcribed mRNAs encoding oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex 1 key subunits, ND3 and ND6, and specifically impairs their function
ND3 protein level in 5XFAD mice was significantly increased by PM1 infusion, compared with cPM (Fig.
There was also a trend of increased levels of ND6 in PM1 treated mice without affecting any other OXPHOS complex components (Fig.
Consistent with the protective effect against the reduction in mitochondrial complex I subunits, PM1 infusion improved both assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex 1 in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice (Fig.
Although PM1 peptide had no effect on the expression of mitochondrial dynamic regulators such as Drp1, Mff, OPA1, and Mfn2 (Supplementary Fig.

Unchanged Aβ plaque deposition in aged 5XFAD mice following PM1 administration
To determine whether alleviated TDP-43 proteinopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities in aged 5XFAD mice were due to decreased Aβ, we first examined the impact of PM1 on Aβ plaque deposition by Thioflavin-S (Thio-S) staining.
Although the plaque size was very similar in the subiculum, cortex, or hippocampus, the plaque load, expressed as the percentage of total surface of brain tissue covered by Aβ plaques, was particularly high in the subiculum (Fig.
No significant change in the numbers, size, and load of Thio-Spositive plaques was noted in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice after PM1 infusion (Fig.
It has been established that Aβ exists as a monomer, and also as oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils
Aβ oligomers are considered to be more toxic than fibrillar Aβ or SPs
To examine if the alleviated TDP-43 proteinopathy by PM1 was associated with reduced oligomer Aβ, we conducted immunostaining using the oligomer Aβ specific antibody NU4 as described
Compared to Thio-S, NU4 stained less Aβ plaques with markedly decreased size in the subiculum (Fig.
Additionally, in the cortex and hippocampus, there were more diffusive plaques stained by NU4.
Like Thio-S-positive plaques, the density, size and number of NU4-positive plaques in all brain areas of PM1-treated 12-month-old 5XFAD mice were comparable to cPM-treated littermates (Fig.
These data are in agreement with the similar plaque deposition or intraneuronal APP/ Aβ immunoreactivity in all animals stained by 6E10, which recognizes both APP and its cleavage products (Supplementary Fig.
Further dot blot examination revealed that the total amount of Aβ remained unchanged in total brain homogenates and purified mitochondria after PM1 infusion (Supplementary Fig.
Taken together, these results indicate that the suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization by PM1 does not affect Aβ plaque deposition.

Protection against neuron loss and gliosis in the subiculum of aged 5XFAD mice via PM1
Since neuronal cell numbers significantly decreased in the subicula and cortical layer 5 of aged 5XFAD mice, we next determined the effects of PM1 on subiculum neurons in 12month-old 5XFAD mice.
After PM1 treatment, neuronal cell numbers in the subicula and cortical layer V of 12-month-old 5XFAD mice were significantly increased by either NeuN or Nissl staining when compared to cPM treatment (Fig.
Neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological feature of AD characterized by the proliferation and activation of microglia and astrocytes (i.e., microgliosis and astrogliosis), which have been reported in 5XFAD mice
To examine the extent of microgliosis and astrogliosis in aged 5XFAD mice following PM1 administration, we immunostained activated microglia and astrocytes in the brain of 12-month-old mice with specific antibodies against ionizing calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) respectively.
Likely corresponding to high Aβ plaque deposition and neuronal loss in the subiculum, aged 5XFAD mice exhibited the predominance of microgliosis and astrogliosis in this specific brain area (Fig.
Interestingly, quantification revealed significantly reduced microgliosis but not astrogliosis in all the selected brain areas of 12-month-old mice treated by PM1 (Fig.

Improved cognitive and motor function in aged 5XFAD mice following PM1 administration
Although 5XFAD mice are viable and phenotypically normal at birth, they begin to show cognitive deficits at around 4 months old and motor-coordinative deficits at around 5 months old (Fig.
We conducted a series of behavioral tests to investigate the cognitive and motor performances in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice after PM1 treatment.
Although 5XFAD mice showed significantly decrease in body weight at 12-month-old compared with NTG, no differences in brain weight, and skeletal muscle mass were noted in 5XFAD mice infused with cPM or PM1 (Fig.
PM1-treated aged 5XFAD mice showed similar traveling distance and moving speed in open field tests with both cPM and NTG mice, indicating that the locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior were not altered by peptide treatment (Fig.
A Barnes maze task consisting of 5 blocks was further used to assess the cognitive benefits of PM1.
Unlike NTG mice showing a decreased time to enter the escape hole in Block 3 and thereafter compared to Block 1, cPM-treated 5XFAD mice barely exhibited any difference in time for escape in all trials (Fig.
After PM1 treatment, 5XFAD mice displayed significantly improved ability to find the escape hole in block 4 and 5 (Fig.
To further test spatial working memory of aged 5XFAD mice, we conducted a Y maze test.
Aged 5XFAD mice showed a significantly lower ratio of spontaneous alternations than NTG mice, suggesting impaired spatial working memory.
Although there was no significant difference, PM1 treatment showed a trend of improved in spatial working memory (Fig.
Then we assessed the motor and coordination function of 5XFAD mice by rotarod test before and after treatment.
We confirmed that there was no significant difference in rotarod performance between cohorts of 10-month-old 5XFAD mice for PM1 and cPM infusion before treatment (Supplementary Fig.
However, compared with mice treated with cPM, 5XFAD mice with PM1 infusion exhibited a trend of improved motor coordination and balance (Fig.
Consistently, despite unchanged muscle strength, walking abnormality (decreased stride length) was significantly alleviated in aged 5XFAD mice after PM1 treatment as indicated by footprint test (Fig.

Prevention of cognitive deficits in young 5XFAD mice by PM1
Considering the significant protective effects of PM1 in aged 5XFAD mice, we also investigated whether PM1 was sufficient to prevent the onset of cognitive impairment observed in young 5XFAD mice.
3-month-old 5XFAD mice were continuously infused with either PM1 or control cPM peptide and then a series of behavioral tests were performed after 10 weeks (Fig.
Similar with aged 5XFAD mice, both cPM and PM1-treated 5-monthold 5XFAD mice showed similar traveling distance and moving speed in open field tests (Supplementary Fig.
Further Barnes maze test were conducted to investigate the cognitive performance.
Although all 6-month-old mice actively explored the maze and showed reduced escaping time over trials, 5XFAD mice infused with cPM spent significantly more time finding the escape hole (Fig.
In contrast, young 5XFAD mice treated with PM1 demonstrated similar performance in all trials compared to age-matched NTG littermates, therefore suggesting that the inhibition of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization by PM1 could abolish the decline in spatial learning in young 5XFAD mice.
Although all 5XFAD mice displayed deficits on the rotarod test at 5 months old compared with NTG littermates, 5XFAD mice treated by PM1 also showed a trend of improved motor coordination and balance (Supplementary Fig.
In 5XFAD mice, Aβ plaques first appear at 2-3 months old and rapidly increases at around 4 months old
Aβ plaque load measured by Thio-S staining was not significantly different between cPM-treated young 5XFAD mice versus aged-matched 5XFAD littermates treated with PM1 (Fig.
Similar with aged 5XFAD mice, PM1 could also alleviate microgliosis at 6-month-old compared to cPM treatment group (Fig.
These findings consistently indicate that the suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization by PM1 could alleviate Aβ toxicity in vivo.

Discussion
Here, our study demonstrates that a peptide inhibitor of mitochondrial TDP-43 administered late in the course of disease can attenuate the development and progression of brain neuronal loss and behavioral deficits in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model for AD.
Our previous study has reported a similar striking rescue effects on brain neurons and cognitive performance by the suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization in the advanced-stage of a TDP-43 transgenic mouse model demonstrating FTD-like dementia
Similar to FTD patients
Therefore, our findings suggest that TDP-43 accumulation in mitochondria is likely a common mechanism underlying neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and other dementia syndrome, and that an inhibitor of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization may provide a potential AD drug to treat the underlying disease or delay its progression.
The accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm or phosphorylated TDP-43 positive inclusion was largely noted in subicular neurons of 5XFAD mice, correlating with the most significant neuronal loss and amyloid plaque load in this restricted area.
Mislocalized TDP-43 highly colocalizes within mitochondria.
We used PM1, a peptide inhibitor derived from TDP-43, to specifically reduce its expression in mitochondria.
PM1 abolished TDP-43 proteinopathy, reversed neuronal loss, and reduced neuroinflammation in aged 5XFAD mice well after symptom onset.
As amyloid plaque load was not alleviated or prevented by PM1, our results strongly indicate that TDP-43 in mitochondria does not affect Aβ pathology, but instead plays an unexpected critical role in mediating Aβ neurotoxicity.
Brains of 5XFAD mice exhibited reduced expression of ND3/6, deficiency in mitochondrial complex I activity, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, all of which were significantly alleviated by PM1.
Within mitochondria, TDP-43 binds mitochondria-transcribed ND3/6, impairs their translation and causes mitochondrial dysfunction
Thus, although it is underdetermined why TDP-43 mislocalizes particularly in subiculum neurons and how mitochondrialassociated TDP-43 acts on mitochondria in the context of Aβ, this evidence supports the possible involvement of mitochondrial TDP-43-related mitochondrial dysfunction in the neuronal loss of 5XFAD mice.
5XFAD mice demonstrated significant impairment in spatial learning and memory.
Interestingly, the subiculum is a component of hippocampus and plays a crucial role in spatial learning and memory functions
Consistent with the rescue of subiculum neurons, spatial learning and memory was significantly improved by PM1, indicating that the cognitive deficit in 5XFAD mice was likely caused by neuronal loss in the subiculum.
In addition to the subiculum, neuronal loss can also be seen selectively in cortical layer 5 but not in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.
Although neuronal loss was modest in cortical layer 5 and only a few cortical neurons displayed mild TDP-43 proteinopathy, PM1 treatment restore the neuron number of aged 5XFAD mice to the NTG level in this area.
Considering the two-week washout period added in this study, long-term or continuous PM1 administration may be necessary for neurogenesis to replenish subiculum neurons to NTG level.
It is conceivable that PM1 could restore subiculum and cortical neurons in 5XFAD mice via neurogenesis.
PM1 alone does not induce neurogenesis in NTG mice, excluding the possibility of over-neurogenesis.
Although the prevention of TDP-43 proteinopathy in subiculum neurons by PM1 strongly indicates neuroprotective effect, neurogenesis may be impaired in the subiculum of 5XFAD mice and future studies are needed to clarify the effect of PM1 on the generation of subiculum neurons from neural stem cells.
Although TDP-43 proteinopathy has been reported in neuroinflammatory cells
In addition to mitochondria, TDP-43 could be present in different subcellular organelles.
Also, despite its likely primary function in RNA processing, TDP-43 exhibits diverse roles in regulating autophagy
Although this study could not exclude the possibility that TDP-43 may contribute to neuronal loss and cognitive impairment indirectly from its cytosolic or nuclear localization in 5XFAD mice, nuclear TDP-43 remained unchanged in 5XFAD mice and cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation could be blocked by the suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization, indicating a critical role of mitochondrial TDP-43 in mediating Aβ-induced TDP-43 proteinopathy.
It is still unclear how PM1 decreased cytosolic localization of TDP-43.
Although no study shows the proteasome-dependent degradation of matrix facing inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) proteins, both the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy pathways have been implicated in cytosolic TDP-43 clearance
Therefore, it is possible that the reduced cytosolic TDP-43 by TDP-43 mitochondrial localization suppression is due to activated UPS or autophagy.
The interplay between mitochondrial TDP-43 and the protein quality control system in AD needs further detailed investigation.
Unlike TDP-43 in ALS or FTD mitochondria
Aβ and TDP-43 did not co-localize in mitochondria by immuno-EM (Supplementary Fig.
Therefore, it is unlikely that Aβ regulates TDP-43 mitochondrial localization through direct interaction.
The expression of total TDP-43 remains unchanged in AD patients and 5XFAD mice, indicating unlikely no alterations of global protein translation or turnover of TDP-43.
As there is no export pathway(s) for proteins localized in mitochondria, the increased mitochondrial TDP-43 in AD or 5XFAD mice should be caused by increased import, impaired clearance or both.
There are more than 10 putative proteases (mitoproteases) located in the matrix of mammalian mitochondria.
LONP1 has been reported as a mitoprotease degrading TDP-43 within mitochondria
Mitoprotease PreP has been implicated in Aβ clearance within mitochondria
Additionally, like many mitochondrial proteins
Although our previous studies showed that mΔψ was reduced by Aβ, the detailed mechanisms by which TDP-43 is imported across mitochondrial outer and inner membrane remain largely unknown
The partial reduction of mΔψ by Aβ might affect, but is unlikely completely to abolish TDP-43 import in the context of Aβ.
Considering that molecular chaperones are usually needed to unfold protein before and during import
Although it is unlikely that LONP1 or other factors regulate mitochondrial function specifically through mitochondrial TDP-43, future studies will be needed to test the necessity and sufficiency of LONP1 or these factors for mitochondrial TDP-43 clearance in AD.
The most recent study and we independently reported the presence of full-length TDP-43 inside of mitochondria using biochemical, genetic and immunostaining approaches
In this study, by immuno-EM, we consistently demonstrated strong TDP-43 immunoreactivity inside of mitochondria largely associated with cristae.
Unlike a previous study reporting increased truncated TDP-43 in isolated total mitochondria from APP/PS1 transgenic mice lacking robust neurodegeneration
Noteworthily, truncated TDP-43 does not containing M1 mitochondrial localization sequence
Therefore, we do not anticipate the involvement of truncated TDP-43 in neuronal loss and behavioral deficits in 5XFAD mice.
Nevertheless, based on the remarkable protective effects of PM1 on Aβ toxicity on neurons in 5XFAD mice, our study strongly suggests an important role of mitochondria-associated TDP-43 in mediating Aβ toxicity.
Of note, despite increasing evidence suggesting mitochondria as targets of TDP-43
To resolve controversy and further investigate the role of mitochondria-associated TDP-43 in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, novel approaches may be needed to test whether mitochondriaassociated TDP-43 or TDP-43 fragments synergically mediate Aβ toxicity on mitochondria and neurons through multiple pathways involving but not limited to bioenergetics, mitochondrial dynamics and ER/mitochondria tethering.

Conclusions
In summary, the present study provides timely information for understanding the role of TDP-43 proteinopathy, and especially mitochondrial-associated TDP-43 in AD.
In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction
We believe that in our investigation of mitochondrial TDP-43, its interaction with AD-related neuropathologies and its contribution to neuronal loss and cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice for AD are of broad significance in the field of neurodegeneration.
More importantly, PM1 is sufficient to prevent neuron loss and improve cognitive impairment well after symptom onset, suggesting that targeting TDP-43 mitochondrial localization can be a novel therapeutic approach with potentially disease-modifying, rather than symptomatic benefits.
