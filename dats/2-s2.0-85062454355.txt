Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration, synaptic integrity, and astroglial activation across the clinical Alzheimer's disease spectrum
Introduction: We investigated relations between amyloid-b (Ab) status, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, and cognition, with cerebrospinal fluid markers of neurogranin (Ng), neurofilament light (NFL), YKL-40, and total tau (T-tau).
Methods: We included 770 individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia from the EMIF-AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study.
We tested the association of Ng, NFL, YKL-40, and T-tau with Ab status (Ab2 vs. Ab1), clinical diagnosis APOE ε4 carriership, baseline cognition, and change in cognition.
Results: Ng and T-tau distinguished between Ab1 from Ab2 individuals in each clinical group, whereas NFL and YKL-40 were associated with Ab1 in nondemented individuals only.
APOE ε4 carriership did not influence NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 in Ab1 individuals.
NFL was the best predictor of cognitive decline in Ab1 individuals across the cognitive spectrum.
Discussion: Axonal degeneration, synaptic dysfunction, astroglial activation, and altered tau metabolism are involved already in preclinical AD.
NFL may be a useful prognostic marker.

Background
Biomarkers have become increasingly important for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
It has been shown that amyloid-b (Ab) deposition is one of the earliest detectable events in AD pathogenesis
However, other pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD and their relation to interindividual variation in cognitive trajectories are less well understood.
By relating Ab, APOE genotype, and cognition to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for ADrelated processes including axonal degeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and astroglial activation in individuals across the clinical AD spectrum, we will likely learn more about the temporal ordering of these pathological mechanisms.
This may translate into improved diagnostic and prognostic algorithms, which, in turn, should help to develop and evaluate more targeted disease-modifying treatments.
Besides Ab, a number of proteins in CSF have been found to be associated with AD.
Both phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) are well-established biomarkers for AD and cognitive decline
High concentrations of neurofilament light (NFL) have been associated with axonal degeneration to, predominantly, subcortical brain areas
Neurogranin (Ng) has been identified as a candidate AD marker reflecting synaptic degeneration and cognitive decline in the early stages of AD
Although NFL, YKL-40, and Ng have evolved over the last years as promising AD biomarkers and have been strongly associated with neuronal injury markers
Hence, to unravel how NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 relate to AD pathology, genetic risk, and disease severity, we aimed to investigate their relationships with Ab, APOE ε4 carriership, and cognition, in a large cohort consisting of individuals across the AD spectrum.
To compare the relations regarding NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 to those of an established neurodegenerative AD marker, we also examined the associations of T-tau with Ab, APOE genotype, and cognition.

Methods

Subjects
We selected 770 individuals from the EMIF-AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) study, a cross-cohort study consisting of collated data and samples from 11 European cohorts
The EMIF-AD MBD includes a total of 1221 individuals across the cognitive spectrum: normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD-type dementia.
Individuals were selected from prospective cohort studies based on the availability of plasma, DNA, and CSF samples and MRI scans.
Exclusion criteria for the EMIF-AD MBD study were the presence of neurological, psychiatric, or somatic disorders that could cause cognitive impairment
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before inclusion in the study.
The medical ethics committee at each site approved the study (Supplementary Table
For the present study, we selected participants from whom CSF samples were available for central analyses (n 5 770).
Participants were included from three multicenter studies: DESCRIPA (n 5 29)

Clinical diagnosis and assessment
Normal cognition was defined as normal performance on neuropsychological assessment (within 1.5 SD of the average for age, gender, and education).
MCI was defined as having performance below 1.5 SD of the average on at least one neuropsychological test
AD-type dementia was defined based on a clinical diagnosis, using the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria
The clinical assessment is described in a previous publication
In short, clinical data were collected using local routine protocol at each site and thereafter harmonized and stored onto the EMIF-AD online data platform for pooled analyses.
We used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
In general, baseline clinical assessment and CSF collection were conducted within a 1-year window.
For a subgroup, the length of this time window was unknown (n 5 21) or longer than 1 year (n 5 2).

CSF analyses
Central CSF analyses were conducted at Gothenburg University, Sweden.
NFL concentrations were measured using a commercial ELISA (NF-light ELISA, UmanDiagnostics, Ume a, Sweden
Ng was measured using an in-house immunoassay for Ng
YKL-40 was determined by a human chitinase-3 quantikine ELISA kit (R&D systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN
Ab 38 , Ab 40 , and Ab 42 were measured using the V-PLEX Plus Ab Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) Kit from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD, Rockville, MD).
All analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions by board-certified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical information.
All measurements were performed on one occasion using one batch of reagents, except for n 5 8 samples from the EDAR cohort that were analyzed beforehand in the same laboratory, but in a different batch.
For P-tau and T-tau, we used available measures from the local cohorts (P-tau n 5 630; T-tau n 5 621) derived in clinical laboratory practice using INNOTEST ELISAs (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium).

Genetic analyses
For the entire EMIF-AD BMD cohort, APOE genotyping data from the local genetic analyses were available for n 5 1121 (91%) individuals.
For central analyses, 805 DNA and 148 whole blood samples were transferred to L€ ubeck University, Germany.
From the blood samples, DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) resulting in 953 DNA samples, of which 926 passed quality control.
All samples were subjected to genome-wide SNP genotyping using the Infinium Global Screening Array with Shared Custom Content (Illumina Inc.).
From these genome-wide data, APOE genotypes were determined either directly (rs7412) or by imputation (rs429358) in all 926 samples.
For 80 samples for which no local APOE genotype was available, and for 45 mismatches between locally derived and Global Screening Array-derived genotypes (4.8%), APOE genotype was determined using TaqMan assays (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA) on a QuantStudio-12K-Flex system in a 384-well format.
We classified individuals as APOE ε4 carriers (ε41) or noncarriers (ε42) according to their genotype status at rs429358 (C-allele 5 ε4).

Biomarker classifications
Ab status was defined by the CSF Ab 42/40 ratio, using a cutoff of ,0.063 to determine abnormality.
This cutoff was defined using mixture model analyses in the current data set
Abnormality based on this cutoff showed a high concordance rate with abnormality based on the local Ab 42 measures and cutoffs (82%).
For the analyses regarding the influence of NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 on cognition, a median split was used to divide the sample (cutoff values: NFL: 869 pg/mL; Ng: 103 pg/mL; YKL-40: 163 ng/mL) as there are no well-established cutoffs or approaches yet to define abnormality and the use of tertiles or quartiles to divide the data would limit statistical power."
Dichotomous T-tau values (normal vs. abnormal) were available in n 5 762 individuals and were determined using local cutoff points (Supplementary Table

Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics were compared by Ab status and diagnostic group using chi-square test for categorical variables and general linear mixed models with study as a random effect for continuous variables.
We also tested whether the influence of Ab on NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 was different across diagnostic groups and age, by examining the diagnostic group by Ab, and age by Ab interactions.
Before the comparisons, Ab 42 , NFL, Ng, YKL-40, P-tau, and T-tau values were log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution.
Spearman's correlations were used to assess the correlations between biomarker values.
General linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes by study were used to examine the influence of Ab status and low/high or normal/abnormal biomarker levels on MMSE performance and decline over time, adjusted for age, gender, years of education, and baseline diagnosis.
Finally, we tested the independent influence of all markers on cognitive decline by adding all dichotomous markers (high/low or normal/abnormal) in one general linear mixed model with MMSE scores over time as an outcome measure, stratified by Ab status.
Missing values for APOE ε4 status (n 5 12) and years of education (n 5 105) were imputed using regression analyses within study, based on significant predictors (i.e., age, gender, MMSE, cognitive scores) for these variables.
All analyses were repeated after exclusion of individuals with a long or unknown interval between clinical assessment and CSF collection (n 5 23).
Statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (version 3.3.3)
and SPSS (version 24).
We used two-sided P , .05 to define statistical significance.
Owing to the exploratory nature of the study, we did not adjust for multiple comparisons.

Results
We assessed 770 individuals who were on average 69.3 (SD 8.3) years old and had an average of 10.9 (SD 3.9) years of education.
Three hundred ninety-nine (52%) were female.
Clinical follow-up data were available for 557 (73%) individuals, with an average follow-up length of 2.3 (SD 1.3) years.
At the baseline, 140 (18%) individuals were considered cognitively normal (CN), 450 (58%) were diagnosed as having MCI, and 180 (23%) were clinically diagnosed as having AD-type dementia.
Despite a clinical diagnosis of AD-type dementia, 23 (13%) individuals did not show evidence of amyloid pathology.

Demographics and biomarker values
Table
As expected, in the whole sample, Ab1 individuals were older, more frequently APOE-ε4 carrier, and had lower MMSE scores compared to Ab2 individuals.
When stratified by baseline diagnosis, we found that Ab1 individuals were older compared to the Ab2 individuals in the CN and MCI groups, but not in the AD-type dementia group.
Only in the MCI group, we found a difference in MMSE score between groups by Ab status.
Other comparisons are shown in Table

NFL, Ng, YKL-40, and T-tau by Ab status and baseline diagnosis
Comparisons by Ab status and baseline diagnoses of NFL, Ng, YKL-40, and T-tau concentrations are shown in Table
Fig.
When comparing by Ab status, NFL and YKL-40 values were differentially increased in Ab1 CN and MCI individuals, whereas in the dementia stage, NFL and YKL-40 levels were elevated regardless of Ab status.
T-tau and Ng values were stably increased in Ab1 individuals across the cognitive spectrum.
For NFL, we found that the influence of Ab on NFL was different across diagnoses (interaction Ab*diagnosis P 5 .027).
NFL concentrations increased in Ab2 individuals with advancing clinical stage, whereas they were stable in the Ab1 CN and MCI groups but increased further in the Ab1 AD-type dementia group (Fig.
The influence of Ab on YKL-40 levels was similar as for NFL (interaction Ab*diagnosis P 5 .001).
For Ng and Ttau, we found that influence of Ab was similar across diagnoses (interaction Ab*diagnosis T-tau: P 5 .771;
Ng: P 5 .580).
Ab1 did have a stronger effect on Ng and T-tau concentrations in younger individuals than in older individuals (interaction Ab*age Ng: P 5 .006;
T-tau: P , .001),
whereas there was no age effect for NFL and YKL-40 (data not shown).

APOE ε4 carriership
In Ab1 individuals, no effect of APOE ε4 carriership on NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 levels was found, regardless of clinical diagnosis (Table
In Ab2 individuals, APOE ε4 carriership was associated with lower levels of NFL in the total group and in individuals with MCI, as well as with lower Ng levels in the MCI and AD-type dementia groups, but with higher Ng levels in the total group (Table
We found no influence of APOE ε4 carriership on YKL-40 and T-tau levels when comparing within Ab status, stratified by diagnosis.
However, compared to the CN Ab2 APOE ε4 noncarriers, T-tau and YKL-40 levels were elevated in Ab1 individuals regardless of clinical diagnosis (Table

Correlations
The Ab isoforms were highly positively correlated, and a more abnormal Ab 42/40 ratio was correlated with higher NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 levels.
P-tau and t-tau were highly correlated and were both associated with all three emerging biomarkers (Supplementary Fig.

Baseline cognition and change in cognition over time
Cross-sectional analyses showed that in Ab1 individuals, high NFL, Ng, and T-tau levels were associated with lower MMSE scores in the total group (Table
When stratifying by diagnostic group within the Ab1 individuals, high NFL levels were associated with low MMSE scores in the MCI and AD-type dementia groups, and high T-tau levels with low MMSE scores in the MCI group (Table
In Ab2 individuals, high NFL levels were associated with lower MMSE scores in the total group, and high T-tau levels with lower scores in the AD-type dementia group.
In addition, high Ng levels were associated with higher MMSE scores in the AD-type dementia group in Ab2 individuals.
Longitudinal analyses showed that in Ab1 individuals, high baseline levels of NFL and T-tau were associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline in the total sample.
High baseline levels of NFL and Ng were also associated with increased rate of decline in the AD-type dementia group.
In Ab2 individuals, high baseline levels of NFL, YKL-40, and T-tau were associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline in the total group, as well as in the MCI and AD-type dementia groups (Table
In Ab2 individuals, high Ng levels were associated with a decreased rate of decline in the MCI group, but with an increased rate of decline in the AD-type dementia group (Table
Next, we combined NFL, YKL-40, Ng, and T-tau in the longitudinal analyses and stratified by baseline diagnosis (Table
In CN Ab1 individuals, only high baseline NFL levels predicted decline.
In Ab1 individuals with MCI, increased baseline NFL and T-tau and decreased Ng levels independently predicted cognitive decline.
In Ab1 individuals with AD-type dementia, increased baseline NFL and Ng levels predicted decline.
Among Ab2 individuals, increased baseline NFL and tau levels predicted decline only in individuals with MCI (Table
When repeating all analyses without the individuals for whom the interval between CSF collection and cognition was longer than 1 year or unknown (n 5 23), results remained similar.
Exclusion of an individual with very high Ng concentrations also yielded similar results.
In addition, outcomes were also similar when using P-tau instead of T-tau in the analyses regarding APOE ε4 carriership and cognition.
and AD-type dementia, independent of the other markers.
Fig.
NFL, Ng, YKL-40, and T-tau concentrations were all associated with Ab1.
In Ab1 individuals, NFL levels were higher in the dementia stage compared to the MCI stage, whereas Ng and YKL-40 levels stayed relatively stable over time.
Yet in Ab2 individuals, we found an increase of both NFL and YKL-40 levels in MCI individuals compared to CN individuals, while Ng levels in Ab2 individuals remained low with increasing disease severity.
T-tau levels increased with disease severity regardless of Ab status, albeit the rate of increase was faster in Ab1 individuals.
These findings confirm that synaptic dysfunction-as measured by Ng-plays an important role in AD pathophysiology in all clinical stages
In addition, our data verify that axonal degeneration and neuroinflammation-as respectively measured by NFL and YKL-40-are less specific to AD
Our findings regarding T-tau levels confirm the association of altered neuronal tau metabolism with Ab pathology
Together, these results provide novel insights into the temporal pattern of AD pathophysiology, which should be validated by longitudinal biomarker studies.
APOE ε4 carriership did not influence NFL, Ng, YKL-40, and T-tau levels in Ab1 individuals in all clinical stages, suggesting that these markers reflect a generic reaction to amyloid aggregation regardless of APOE genotype.
In Ab2 individuals, APOE ε4 carriers with MCI or AD-type dementia had lower NFL and Ng levels compared to noncarriers.
This suggests that the Ab2 APOE ε4 noncarriers with MCI or AD-type dementia might have other pathologies not related to Ab and APOE ε4 carriership  that are causing cognitive impairment, axonal degeneration, and to a lesser extent also synaptic dysfunction.

Discussion
Regarding T-tau and YKL-40 levels, we found similar concentrations in APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers, which is in line with previous studies
Besides the inconsistency with the latter study, possibly due to heterogeneity in sample sizes or biomarker classifications, our results confirm that YKL-40 concentrations are independent of APOE ε4 carriership.
Higher levels of NFL and T-tau were associated with a lower cognitive performance and an increased rate of decline regardless of Ab status.
As both NFL and T-tau are markers of axonal degeneration
Concerning Ng, we found that only in the dementia stage, higher concentrations were associated with a faster rate of decline, regardless of Ab.
This is congruent with previous CSF biomarker studies suggesting that Ng might be strongly associated with cognition, irrespective of amyloid plaque pathology
However, Ng changes have also been associated with cognitive decline in preclinical AD
Post hoc, we explored the influence of the cognitive outcome measure by repeating the analyses in a subgroup (n 5 615) with a pooled standardized memory score
These post hoc analyses showed that high Ng levels tended to be associated with a faster decline in memory performance in CN Ab1, but not in CN Ab2 individuals (data not shown).
The negative impact of high YKL-40 levels on cognition seems to only relate to Ab2 individuals, or the influence is masked by Ab pathology in Ab1 individuals.
These findings suggest that YKL-40 may be a prognostic marker for individuals with MCI but without evidence of Ab pathology, for instance, those with suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (SNAP)
When all markers were combined in one model, we found that NFL and from the MCI stage onward also T-tau were independent predictors of cognitive decline in Ab1 individuals.
Remarkably high Ng levels were associated with a slower rate of decline in Ab1 individuals with MCI and a faster rate of decline in Ab1 individuals with AD-type dementia.
Although a similar finding was described in a previous study
Possibly, Ng is not a direct contributor to cognitive decline in the predementia stages or the relation between Ng and cognition is again dependent on the cognitive outcome measure used (global cognition vs. memory).
This study has several limitations.
First, data were collected at different centers using routine local protocols.
However, the CSF samples were analyzed centrally for most outcome measures-Ab 38, Ab 40 , Ab 42, NFL, Ng, and YKL-40-and clinical data were harmonized using validated methods like standardization and dichotomization.
Second, our AD-type dementia group contained Ab2 individuals, a consequence of using a clinical diagnosis for classification, instead of a biomarker-based diagnosis.
Although this makes our demented group more heterogeneous, it does reflect current clinical practice and is in line with earlier research showing that w20% of individuals with AD dementia are Ab2
Third, our clinical follow-up may have been too short to obtain an accurate view of cognitive trajectories over time.
And finally, we chose the MMSE to assess cognition as these data were available in nearly all individuals, but it might not be sensitive enough to detect subtle cognitive decline and decline in specific cognitive domains.
Future studies with longer follow-up and employing other cognitive measures should therefore validate our results regarding cognitive decline.
In conclusion, we found that NFL, Ng, and YKL-40 were associated with Ab pathology, showing that axonal degeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are all, to some extent, involved in AD pathophysiology.
Furthermore, we found that NFL is a generic prognostic marker that is elevated early in AD and has a profound influence on cognition.
Ng is a useful AD marker as it is closely related to Ab and tau in all cognitive stages and is associated with cognition.
YKL-40 has an influence on cognitive decline in absence of Ab and thereby may be of value to increase the accuracy of the prognosis of individuals with SNAP.
Finally, our data identify NFL as the strongest predictor of cognitive decline in Ab1 individuals across the cognitive stages.
Altogether, our findings improve prognostic accuracy and increase our knowledge of biomarker changes in relation to disease evolution.
