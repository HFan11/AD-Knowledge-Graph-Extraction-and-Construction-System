Preanalytical sample handling recommendations for Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers
Introduction: We examined the influence of common preanalytical factors on the measurement of Alzheimer's disease-specific biomarkers in human plasma.
Methods: Amyloid b peptides , Ab ) and total Tau plasma concentrations were quantified using fully automated Roche Elecsys assays.
Results: Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and total Tau plasma concentrations were not affected by up to three freeze/thaw cycles, up to five tube transfers, the collection tube material, or the size; circadian rhythm had a minor effect.
All three biomarkers were influenced by the anticoagulant used, particularly total Tau.
Ab concentrations began decreasing 1 hour after blood draw/before centrifugation and decreased by up to 5% and 10% at 2 and 6 hours, respectively.
For separated plasma, time to measurement influenced Ab levels by up to 7% after 6 hours and 10% after 24 hours.
Discussion: Our findings provide guidance for standardizing blood sample collection, handling, and storage to ensure reliable analysis of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in routine practice and clinical trials.

Introduction
Dementia is considered one of the biggest threats to the aging population and is also a major public health problem worldwide, with significant socioeconomic implications.
The leading cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounting for 50%-80% of all dementia cases
At present, clinical diagnosis of AD is only correct in w77% of cases, with a significant number of patients diag-nosed when their disease has already advanced
Poor diagnostic accuracy hampers appropriate and comprehensive management of AD.
Given that novel disease-modifying therapies for AD will likely be most efficacious when administered in the early stages of the disease, there is a growing demand for tools that can accurately detect and diagnose AD at presymptomatic stages.
A promising approach to improving the diagnostic certainty of AD is the application of disease-associated biomarkers that reflect the nature and severity of the neuropathologic processes in the AD brain.
Numerous studies have confirmed the relevance of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid b peptide 42 (Ab ), total Tau (tTau), and 181 Thr-phosphorylated Tau to the diagnosis of AD
In combination, these biomarkers distinguish patients with AD from controls with sensitivity and specificity in the range of 85%-95%
CSF biomarkers are already integrated into the National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Association Diagnostic Guidelines for AD and are being used routinely in clinical trials for participant selection and monitoring of drug response and disease progression
ver, in recent years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to identifying blood-based biomarkers that could eventually replace CSF and positron emission tomography biomarkers.
The greatest advantage of bloodbased biomarkers versus other types of biomarker is that collection of blood is less invasive and involves a more cost-effective and time-efficient procedure.
As an intermediate step before replacing CSF and positron emission tomography biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers for AD could be considered optimal screening tools to identify individuals at risk who could subsequently be screened, and their condition confirmed, by positron emission tomography imaging or CSF analysis
Experience with CSF AD biomarkers, however, shows that preanalytical factors linked to sample handling and processing before measurement can greatly influence the measured concentration of protein biomarkers
Lack of standardization across these preanalytical procedures inevitably leads to significant variability in the results, preventing the establishment of universal cutoff values and direct between-laboratory and between-study comparisons.
Given the rapid progress toward developing blood-based biomarkers for clinical use in AD
In addition, results presented in this study utilized, for the first time, a highly precise, robust, fully automated, high-throughput analytical method (Elecsys technology) to recommend procedures for collection, handling, and storage of blood samples that will support accurate and reliable analysis of AD-specific plasma biomarkers in routine practice and clinical trials.

Methods

Plasma measurements
Plasma concentrations of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau were quantified using Roche Elecsys robust prototype assays on the fully automated cobas e 601 analyzer.
The Roche Elecsys robust prototype assays used in this study were adaptations from the commercially available CSF assays using the same antibodies and buffer compositions but using plasma calibrators and controls
The coefficient of variation (CV) for intraassay and interassay precision, respectively, are 1.4% and 1.1% for Ab(1-40), 1.6% and 3.0% for Ab(1-42), 1.3% and 2.1% for tTau.
The lower limit of quantification of these noncommercial, robust prototype assays is 9 pg/mL, 6 pg/mL, and 1 pg/mL for plasma Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau assay, respectively.

Sample collection and handling
Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers at Roche Medical Center (Penzberg, Germany).
All participants gave written informed consent for their blood samples to be used for research.
Ethical approval was received from the local ethics committee (Die Ethikkommission bei der Bayerischen Landesâ‚¬ arztekammer) for use of blood samples in this study.
Venipuncture was performed following standard operating procedures.
Free flow of blood with mild aspiration was ensured to avoid hemolysis.
Immediately after filling, the collection tube was inverted five times to ensure proper mixing of blood and anticoagulant, or other additive.
The collected blood was kept in the collection tube at room temperature (RT) pending centrifugation.
Unless otherwise stated, blood samples were centrifuged within 1 hour of collection for 10 minutes at 2000 g at RT in a swing bucket centrifuge (except for the experiment reported in Section 3.4).
Separated plasma was transferred into a 15 mL polypropylene (PP) tube then, mixed by inversion several times before immediate aliquoting into 0.5 mL PP tubes.
All samples were processed as described unless specified; details of all tubes are provided in Supplementary Table

Sample collection/handling parameter assessments
We analyzed the effects of the following preanalytical variables on quantitative analysis of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau in human plasma: circadian rhythm, type of anticoagulant, material, size and filling height of a primary collection tube, time between blood draw and centrifugation, duration and temperature of storage of plasma before measurement, number of tube transfers, and number of freeze/thaw cycles at different freezing temperatures.
Detailed information on blood collection and sample processing for individual analyses is provided in Supplementary Table

Statistical analysis
For all analyses, the mean and CV of tested subjects were calculated.
Sample recovery rates under test conditions were reported as mean percentage differences.
Outliers were defined as any data points .1.5 interquartile ranges below the first quartile or above the third quartile.
No formal statistical testing was conducted; all analyses are descriptive.

Results
A summary of the analyses conducted and results obtained is provided in Table

Impact of circadian rhythm
All three biomarkers showed a weak throughout-the-day circadian rhythmicity.
Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels were a mean average of 5%-9% higher in samples collected in the afternoon versus morning, while the opposite trend was observed for tTau (Fig.
Intrasubject variability (CV) over the 8-hour period was between 3% and 13% for plasma Ab and tTau proteins.
Within-day fluctuations in blood levels of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) had no effect on the Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio.
No marked difference in plasma concentrations of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), or tTau was observed between the 8:00 AM values on days 1, 2, and 7.

Impact of choice of anticoagulant
Since ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) allows the best preservation of cellular components and morphology  Na-citrate, sodium citrate; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; PP, polypropylene; tTau, total Tau, 9F, 9 mL tube filled 100%; 9H, 9 mL tube filled 50%; 4-9H, 4.9 mL tube filled 50%; 10H, 10 mL tube filled 50%.
For tube type abbreviations, please see Supplementary Table
of blood cells, it is often used as the anticoagulant of choice for hematologic testing
Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau concentrations determined in heparinized and citrated plasma were normalized to the levels in K3-EDTA plasma.
Both commonly used anticoagulants (lithium heparin [Li-heparin] and sodium citrate [Na-citrate]) had a significant impact on the measurement of all three AD biomarkers in plasma, and on tTau in particular (Fig.
For tTau, use of Na-citrate or Li-heparin reduced tTau levels by up to 50% and 70%, respectively, versus K3-EDTA.
Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels in plasma with Na-citrate were 10% and 5% lower, respectively, versus K3-EDTA.
Samples collected in Li-heparin showed a 15% increase in Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels, compared with K3-EDTA samples.
The presence of Na-citrate but not Li-heparin led to an 8% increase in the Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, versus K3-EDTA.

Impact of size, material, and filling height of the primary collection tube
There was no marked difference in the levels of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau, between different materials (PP vs. polyethylene terephthalate) or tube sizes (Fig.
There was no change in measured concentrations of any biomarker with use of different potassium salts (K2-EDTA vs. K3-EDTA) or the presence of a gel separator in the collection device.
The mean values of intratube CV were 2.3%, 2.4%, 2.6%, and 4.6% for Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau, respectively.
There was no marked difference in the recovery of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and/or Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio between half-filled and fully filled tubes (Fig.
A 12%-14% reduction in the measured concentration of tTau was observed for half-filled tubes versus fully filled tubes.

Stability of whole blood before plasma separation
Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) were unstable in whole blood; levels of both biomarkers started decreasing 1 hour after blood collection, leading to the reduction of Ab peptides in plasma levels by 4%-5% and 8%-10% after 2 and 6 hours, respectively, compared with baseline (30 minutes after blood collection).
Increasing the time between blood draw and centrifugation to 24 hours resulted in the loss of 50% of the measurable amount of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) at baseline.
The Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio had a higher tolerance with respect to time to plasma separation and remained unchanged for up to 6 hours after blood collection.
tTau demonstrated very high stability in whole blood, for at least 6 hours.

Stability of previously frozen and thawed plasma
The stability of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) was not affected by sample storage at 14 C or RT during the first hour after thawing (Fig.
At later time points, the decrease in Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels was less if stored at 14 C, compared with RT: mean concentrations of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) after 6 hours decreased by 5%-7% at 14 C compared with 15%-18% at RT; after 24 hours, Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) concentrations were decreased by 8%-10% versus 40% in plasma samples stored at 14 C and RT, respectively.
Storage time and temperature did not impact the Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio or tTau concentrations, which remained unaffected for up to 24 hours at both 14 C and RT.

Stability of freshly separated plasma
During the first 3 hours after centrifugation, there was no marked difference in the stability between Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) (Fig.
However, after 6 hours, Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels decreased by 3% and 5%, respectively.
After 24 hours, Ab(1-40) levels were reduced by 10%, but  Ab(1-42) levels did not change further.
This effect on Ab(1-40) but not Ab(1-42) negatively affected the Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio which increased by 10% after 24 hours.

Impact of tube transfers
There was no marked effect of tube transfer on the measured levels of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau (mean difference in levels between no tube transfer and five tube transfers was 2%, 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively [Fig.

Impact of freeze/thaw cycles and freezing temperature
Before performing multiple freeze/thaw experiments, we first evaluated whether there was an association between the material and size of the primary blood collection tube and the recovery of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40)  Abbreviations: Ab, amyloid b; gel, presence of gel separator in a tube; K2E, K2-EDTA; K3E, K3-EDTA; PET, polyethylene terephthalate; PP, polypropylene; tTau, total Tau.

ratio, and tTau after one freeze/thaw cycle.
The recovery of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau after one freeze/thaw cycle was unaffected by the size and material of the collection tube (Fig.
Between-tube variability was 1.4%-4.6%,
1.2%-2.6%,
0.5%-3.9%,
and 1.2%-4.9%
for Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau, respectively.
Therefore, we conducted a multiple freeze/thaw cycle experiment using only the S-Monovette Ã’ K3-EDTA 9 mL tube (Sarstedt, Nâ‚¬ umbrecht, Germany).
Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels were only minimally reduced (decrease did not exceed 4%) by repeated freeze/thaw cycles at -80 C. tTau levels decreased by 7% after the second freeze/thaw cycle but remained unchanged between the second and third freeze/thaw cycle (Fig.
Alongside -80 C, freeze/thaw stability at 220 C and 225 C was also evaluated (data not shown).
tTau levels slightly decreased after the third freeze/thaw cycle at 220 C and 225 C (by 3% and 2%, respectively).
Ab(1-40) levels were unchanged, but slight increases of 4% and 5% were seen for Ab(1-42) after the first freeze/thaw cycle at 220 C and 225 C, respectively.
In addition, the storage stability of all three biomarkers at 220 C, 225 C, and -80 C for 14 days was tested.
No marked differences in the measured concentrations of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio, and tTau were observed between plasma samples frozen and stored at 220 C, 225 C and 280 C for 14 days (Fig.

Discussion
Preanalytical factors are responsible for up to 60% of errors in laboratory medicine
Numerous studies have shown that even small differences in preanalytical variables, such as collection and handling of a specimen before analysis, have a direct influence on the quality of analytical results and their clinical reliability
Differences in preanalytical procedures were also found to be the main source of variability in absolute concentrations of CSF AD biomarkers between different centers, even when using the same assay
Given an increasing interest in bloodbased biomarkers for AD, the understanding and characterization of preanalytical sample handling factors that may impact the quantification of AD-related proteins in plasma is critical to ensuring interlaboratory and intralaboratory consistency of analytical results.
As previously reported, circadian rhythm is involved in many physiologic processes, and several functional proteins have been shown to exhibit strong diurnal dynamics
Such time-of-day-dependent oscillations in blood levels of molecules could be a potential cause of variability in laboratory results, making sampling time an important consideration.
Consistent with earlier reports in which the circadian rhythm of Ab isoforms in blood was assessed using the INNO-BIA multiplex assay
Another important factor when testing Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau is the primary tube used for blood collection.
A considerable number of studies have demonstrated that AD biomarkers (Ab peptides in particular) are very prone to nonspecific adsorption to non-PP surfaces
In contrast to CSF, no measurable loss of Ab was previously found in plasma when glass tubes were used for blood collection instead of plastic
Our study provides further evidence that the primary collection tube material has no impact on the measured levels of plasma Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau.
Moreover, we show that quantification of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau is not affected by tube size, form of potassium salt, or the presence of gel separators.
However, a 15% reduction in the measured concentration of tTau, but not Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42), was seen when a collection tube was filled to only 50% of its nominal volume, compared with being fully filled.
We evaluated the potential impact of the time interval between blood collection and plasma separation, as well as the interval and storage temperature after plasma separation but before measurement.
Several prior studies have demonstrated that delayed centrifugation of whole blood impacts the analysis of biochemical components in plasma and serum samples
Quantification of blood-based protein biomarkers may be severely impaired due to, for example, degradation by multiple proteolytic enzymes in the blood, or in the plasma or serum present in supernatant after complete blood coagulation
Moreover, the quantitative measurement of AD biomarkers might be affected by aggregation-dependent depletion of the monomeric forms of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42).
Both Ab peptides, but Ab(1-42) in particular, are well known for their intrinsic instability manifested by their high propensity to oligomerize and form b-sheet-rich amyloid aggregates
Therefore, the time between blood collection and plasma separation, and between plasma separation and measurement, should be thoroughly investigated when testing AD biomarkers.
Our study revealed a maximum of 1-hour tolerance of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) between blood collection and separating plasma to avoid any decrease in peptide levels, whereas tTau remained stable for up to 6 hours.
However, the use of Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio can compensate for the decrease in absolute peptide levels, with ratio measures unaffected in samples centrifuged 2 hours after collection.
While we think that the impact of these preanalytical factors can be largely attributed to the degradation of the peptides ex vivo, the influencing factors identified in this study most likely apply to other detection methods as well.
However, to be certain, we recommend that these common preanalytical factors be assessed individually for other detection methods and each additional biomarker, for example, neurofilament light.
Since experimental design frequently necessitates the use of frozen samples for retrospective analysis, we investigated the effect of storage conditions on the stability of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau in fresh (unfrozen) and previously frozen/thawed plasma samples.
For thawed samples (after single freeze/thaw), we observed a time-dependent decrease in the stability of plasma Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42), but not tTau, irrespective of RT or 14 C storage temperature.
The decrease of the Ab peptide levels is strongly influenced by temperature, leading to a 40% decrease in Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) levels in samples stored at RT. Storage at 14 C is acceptable for up to 6 hours for measurement of plasma Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and up to 24 hours if reporting the Ab(1-42): Ab(1-40) ratio.
In cases of measuring fresh, previously unfrozen plasma samples, they are stable for at least 6 hours at 14 C, after which they should be analyzed or frozen for long-term storage.
Repeated freezing and thawing, often performed as part of sample processing, is also a potential source of variability.
For plasma biomarkers, one study reported that measurable levels of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) were decreased by up to 20% after three freeze/thaw cycles
In our study, plasma levels of Ab(1-40) and Ab(1-42) were unaffected for up to three freeze/thaw cycles at various freezing temperatures, while a 7% decrease was observed for tTau after the second freeze/thaw cycle.
We also showed that the measured concentrations of plasma Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau were not influenced by up to five consecutive transfers between tubes.
Based on our findings, we recommend the following guideline for the collection, handling, and storage of blood samples for the analysis of Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42), and tTau in plasma (Fig.
We believe that the recommendations outlined here will help greatly reduce the variability and enable the direct comparison of blood-based biomarker results across laboratories and studies.
This will be an essential prerequisite for  the integration of blood-based biomarkers into clinical trials and routine practice for supporting the diagnosis of AD.
