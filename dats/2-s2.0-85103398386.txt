miR-135a-5p mediates memory and synaptic impairments via the Rock2/Adducin1 signaling pathway in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease
Aberrant regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but most abnormally expressed miRNAs found in AD are not regulated by synaptic activity.
Here we report that dysfunction of miR-135a-5p/Rock2/Add1 results in memory/synaptic disorder in a mouse model of AD. miR-135a-5p levels are significantly reduced in excitatory hippocampal neurons of AD model mice.
This decrease is tau dependent and mediated by Foxd3.
Inhibition of miR-135a-5p leads to synaptic disorder and memory impairments.
Furthermore, excess Rock2 levels caused by loss of miR-135a-5p plays an important role in the synaptic disorder of AD via phosphorylation of Ser726 on adducin 1 (Add1).
Blocking the phosphorylation of Ser726 on Add1 with a membrane-permeable peptide effectively rescues the memory impairments in AD mice.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that synaptic-related miR-135a-5p mediates synaptic/memory deficits in AD via the Rock2/Add1 signaling pathway, illuminating a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

A
lzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in aged people with an increasing incidence with age in the population worldwide
The best characterized clinical manifestation of AD is progressive cognitive decline, which appears at the very early stages of AD, in the absence of the two pathological hallmarks: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
Although the underlying mechanisms involved in the two pathological changes have been well studied, therapeutic strategies targeting these pathologies have failed.
To date, there have been no approved drugs to block the decline in cognitive function in AD.
Synapses are considered the fundamental units in the brain, and synaptic activity can stimulate the maturation of mushroomshaped spines and form new synapses
In the brain of an individual with AD, both the disruption of synaptic activity and loss of synapses were found, especially at the early disease stage
Compared with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic disorders, characterized by loss of synapses and decreased synaptic activity, have higher correlations with cognitive impairments in AD
Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of synaptic disorders will be beneficial to the development of therapeutic strategies for AD at an early stage.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small noncoding RNAs ~22 bp in length that silence targeted genes at the posttranscriptional level
miRNAs participate in many physiological processes and pathological pathways, including embryonic development, tumorigenesis, and cardiac diseases
The finetuning ability of miRNAs permits them to regulate the local translation of synaptic-associated proteins at synapses
In brain tissue or sera from individuals with AD, numerous miRNAs have been identified to be deregulated and proposed to be involved in the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
Recently, the abnormal regulation of miRNAs in the synaptic disorder of AD was also investigated.
Some brainenriched miRNAs, such as miR-124, miR-125b, and miR-132
However, most of these miRNAs expression levels are not themselves regulated by synaptic activity.
Thus, how these miRNAs contribute to synaptic disorders in AD remains elusive.
Here, we first screened for alterations in the levels of miRNAs associated with synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of AD model mice and found that miR-135a-5p is abnormally downregulated in excitatory pyramidal neurons.
The loss of miR-135a-5p is tau dependent and mediated by the reduction of the transcriptional factor Forkhead box D3 (Foxd3).
Artificial inhibition of miR-135a-5p results in synaptic disorder and memory impairments via activation of the Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (Rock2)/Adducin 1 (Add1) signaling pathway.
Overexpressing miR-135a-5p or silencing Rock2 not only rescues dendritic spine maturation but also attenuates synaptic disorders and memory deficits in AD model mice.
Finally, a peptide that can block the direct phosphorylation of Add1 exerts similar neuroprotective effects, which provides the basis for developing a novel therapeutic approach for AD.

Results
Alterations in synaptic activity-dependent miRNAs in the hippocampus of AD model mice.
To understand the potential role of synaptic activity-associated miRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD, we first performed a systematic analysis of the expression profile of synaptic activity-related miRNAs in the hippocampus of AD model mice at different stages.
We focused on 12 miRNAs related to synaptic plasticity as reported in previous literature
We found that at 12 months of age, the AD model mice showed apparent downregulation of miR-135a-5p and upregulation of miR-136-3p, miR-19a-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-26a-5p (Fig.
However, at 9 months of age, only a decrease in miR-135a-5p and an increase in miR-125b-5p were detected (Fig.
These data suggested that miR-135a-5p downregulation or miR-125b-5p upregulation may play an important role in the relatively early stages of AD.
As the dysfunction of miR-125b-5p in AD has been well documented
The miR-135a-5p expression is abnormally reduced in the hippocampus of AD model mice and the human frontal cortex of patients with AD.
We further examined changes in miR-135a-5p levels in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice of different ages.
We found that the level of miR-135a-5p was not changed at 3 months in APP/PS1 mice but showed a decrease at 6 months (Fig.
We also performed fluorescence in situ hybridization and detected that the decrease in miR-135a-5p expression is prominent in CaMKII-positive neurons (Fig.
In the cultured primary neurons, the miR-135a-5p level was reduced upon overexpression of human Tau, APP, or PS1 (Fig.
However, in primary neurons from Tau knockout mice, only Tau overexpression could induce the reduction in miR-135a-5p (Supplementary Fig.
In line with this, downregulation of miR-135a-5p was also detected in the hippocampus of P301S tau mice at 6 months (Supplementary Fig.
Moreover, the extent of Tau expression was negatively correlated with miR-135a-5p levels in the hippocampus of AD model mice (Fig.
These data suggested that the loss of miR-135a-5p in AD is tau dependent, which leads to suppressed synaptic strength (Supplementary Fig.
Finally, in the frontal cortex of patients with AD and AD mice, the level of miR-135a-5p is decreased when compared to age-matched control subjects (Fig.
Loss of miR-135a-5p expression is mediated by the reduction of Foxd3.
We then investigated why miR-135a-5p is downregulated in AD.
Previous studies have shown that RNA degradation is increased in the brains of individuals with AD
To test this hypothesis, we examined the stability of miR-135a-5p by blocking new RNA synthesis with actinomycin D
We found that the half-life of miR-135a-5p in Tau-overexpressing neurons was identical to that in control virus-infected neurons (Fig.
Our data are reliable because the half-life of miR-132-3p in our system was approximately 4 h (Fig.
Thus, the suppression of miR-135a-5p by Tau overexpression was not caused by dysfunction in RNA degradation.
Next, we considered whether the transcription of miR-135a-5p is suppressed in AD.
To address this, we measured the levels of primary miR-135a-5p transcript (pri-miR-135a-1/2) in the nuclear fractions of primary hippocampal cultures with Tau overexpression.
We found that pri-miR-135a-1 but not pri-miR-135a-2 was reduced in Tau-overexpressing neurons (Fig.
Consistent with that result, pri-miR-135a-1 was reduced in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 AD model mice from 6 months (Fig.
These data suggested that the transcription of pri-miR-135a-1 is inhibited, which possibly leads to the loss of miR-135a-5p in AD.
To determine how this transcription was inhibited, we cloned different fragments (1 kb, 2 kb, 3 kb) of the promoter region of pri-miR-135a-1 and inserted them into the pGL3-reporter luciferase construct (Fig.
We found that the construct containing the 1 kb promoter region exhibited the highest luciferase intensity (Fig.
We further analyzed the potential transcriptional factor binding sites within the promoter region of pri-miR-135a-1 (chr9:106153125-106154124) by implementing three independent website tools (RegRNA2.0 21
, PROMO
By examining their expression in the brain (www.uniprot.org
and www.biogps.org),
we observed that the expression levels of Max, Ahr, Arnt, Olf-1, and HNF-3β are very low in the brain, which rules out their potential roles in regulating the transcription of pri-miR-135a-1 in the brain.
We then focused on the remaining three transcriptional factors: Gata-1, Foxd3, and Foxo1.
By performing cotransfection of these three factors with the reporter construct, we determined that overexpression of Foxd3 but not of Foxo1 or Gata-1 resulted in dramatically increased luciferase activity in cells transduced with the reported construct containing the pri-miR-135a-1 promoter (Fig.
Consistently, existing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data (GSE58407)
The results of our ChIP assay demonstrated that Foxd3 could bind with the pri-miR-135a-1 promoter (P-135a), and the binding affinity was attenuated by Tau in vitro (Fig.
Moreover, the protein level of Foxd3 was decreased to 53% and 57% in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and P301S tau mice compared to that in wild-type littermates (Fig.
Upon overexpressing Foxd3 in primary hippocampal neurons transfected with Tau, we discovered that the level of miR-135a-5p was restored (Fig.
Thus, we concluded that the loss of miR-135a-5p induced by Tau is due to the reduction of Foxd3.
Inhibition of miR-135a-5p expression induces memory impairments in vivo.
We then asked whether the loss of miR-135a-5p expression is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.
Because the decrease of miR-135a-5p was first detected in the 6month AD mice, we then performed bilateral intrahippocampal injection of an AAV-miR-135a-5p (1 × 10 12 ) sponge (S-135a) to simulate the loss of miR-135a-5p in the hippocampus of 6-month wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Fig.
We evaluated spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of these mice one month later and observed that the S-135a-infected mice displayed longer latency from the fourth day during the learning stage in the Morris water maze task (Fig.
During the probe trial test, compared with the control mice, S-135a-infected mice showed longer latency for the first crossing, fewer crossings to the platform region, and shorter swimming time in the target quadrant with no changes in swimming speed (Fig.
Furthermore, in the Barnes maze task, S-135a-infected mice displayed fewer nose poke numbers within the target hole, longer latency to the target hole, and more errors made during the search stages for the target hole than control mice (Fig.
Finally, in the fear conditioning test, S-135ainfected mice showed a significant reduction in freezing time in the contextual conditioning paradigms, while only a slight difference was detected in tone conditioning (Fig.
Together, these results indicated that loss of miR-135a-5p expression induced Alzheimer-like learning and memory deficits in mice.

Inhibition of miR-135a-5p induces synaptic disorder in vivo.
Because hippocampal synaptic plasticity is believed to be the basis of learning memory
We first evaluated hippocampal LTP in the CA3-CA1 circuit and found that the I-O curve in S-135a-infected mice was lower than that in control virus-infected mice (Fig.
In addition, S-135a-infected mice displayed impairment in LTP because the normalized fEPSP slope was dramatically suppressed (Fig.
Moreover, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) experiments suggested that S-135a did not impair presynaptic vesicle release (Fig.
Golgi staining revealed that S-135a not only decreased the density of dendritic spines but also reduced the percentage of mushroom-type spines (Fig.
These data suggested that the loss of miR-135a-5p expression results in synaptic disorder in vivo, which was observed in AD model mice
Loss of miR-135a-5p expression results in the activation of the Rock2 signaling pathway.
It is known that miRNAs control gene expression by either inhibiting the translation or promoting the degradation of their target mRNAs
Based on this premise, we sought to identify the direct target of miR-135a-5p that mediates synaptic disorders in AD.
We used TargetScan
Then, we selected 194 common candidate genes and conducted a KEGG The degradation curve of miR-135a-5p, miR-132-3p, and U6 were measured by qRT-PCR in primary hippocampal neurons at DIV 7 after treated with 10 μg/mL actinomycin D for 0-12 h (n = 4 for each group).

g The pGL3-1kb was co-transfected into HEK293T with transcriptional factors (Gata-1, Foxd3, Foxo1), and the luciferase activity was analyzed at 48 h later (n = 3 for each group, one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001, Dunnett's post hoc p < 0.0001 vs. Con).

One week later, neurons were infected with AAV-Foxd3-Flag.
The cell lyses were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag and then primers of the pri-miR-135a-1 promoter (P-135a) were used for PCR assay.

analysis (Supplementary Fig.
We found that 15 signal pathways were highly enriched, and the adjusted p value was less than 0.05 (Supplementary Table
Among the candidates in the 15 signal pathways, four of them (Rock1, Rock2, Cacna1d, and Pik3r2) were the most attractive because they exist in at least four pathways and are associated with actin cytoskeleton dynamics or calcium signaling.
Given that Rock1 protein is mainly distributed in nonneuronal cells
We also detected (encoded by Pik3r2) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.
We found that only Rock2 expression was dramatically upregulated (Fig.
To verify the direct regulation of Rock2 by miR-135a-5p, we constructed the wild-type (WT) 3′UTR region of Rock2 (NM_009072.2), which contains the miR-135a-5p binding site, and a 3′UTR variant with a mutation at the miR-135a-5p binding site; cloned them both in a luciferase reporter gene and cotransfected the reporter vectors into HEK293T cells with either miR-135a-5p mimic or scrambled control (Fig.
We found that the miR-135a-5p mimic suppressed the luciferase intensity in cells transfected with the WT construct but not the mutated construct (Fig.
Meanwhile, by transfecting the mimic and inhibitor of miR-135a-5p into Neuro2a cells, we found that the protein levels of Rock2 were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, while mRNA levels were unaffected (Supplementary Fig.
These data suggested the direct posttranscriptional regulation of Rock2 by miR-135a-5p.
More importantly, we detected a negative correlation of miR-135a-5p and Rock2 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and C57 mice (Supplementary Fig.
Next, we explored the potential downstream effectors of Rock2 activation in mediating synaptic disorders in AD.
Considering the above data, Rock2 activation may result in morphological changes in dendrites and dendritic spines, which depend on actin cytoskeleton remodeling.
By referring to a previous report
By combining this information with a phospho-proteomics study of a brain from an individual with AD
We found that in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice at 9 months, phosphorylation at Thr445 and Ser726 of Add1 and at Thr555 of Crmp2 were dramatically increased (Fig.
However, in cultured hippocampal neurons, application of the miR-135a-5p inhibitor only markedly increased the phosphorylation of Add1 at Thr445 and Ser726, but not the Crmp2 at Thr555 (Fig.
Furthermore, in the frontal cortex of patients with AD and AD mice, the levels of phosphorylated Ser726-Add1 are increased, which are accompanied by an increase in Rock2 expression (Fig.
Importantly, we detected a relatively strong negative correlation of miR-135a-5p and both Rock2 and phospho-S726-Add1 but a positive correlation of Rock2 and phospho-S726-Add1 (Fig.
Thus, the loss of miR-135a-5p expression results in aberrant Rock2 activation and the subsequent deregulation of the cellular cytoskeleton via phosphorylation of Add1 at Ser726.
Overexpression of miR-135a-5p or silencing of Rock2 rescues memory impairments and synaptic disorders in AD model mice.
We then asked whether upregulation of miR-135a-5p or silencing of Rock2 could rescue memory impairments and synaptic disorders in AD model mice.
We used 8-month-old APP/PS1 mice for the injection, because the memory impairment was apparent in 9 months but not 6 months mice
Upon infusion of the agomir of miR-135a-5p or the lentivirus containing Rock2-specific shRNA into the hippocampus of 8-monthold APP/PS1 mice (Supplementary Fig.
Moreover, the LTP/LTD deficits (Fig.
These data suggested that restoring the miR-135a-5p/ Rock2 signaling pathway rescues memory impairments and synaptic disorders in AD.
A peptide blocking the phosphorylation of Add1 rescues memory impairments and synaptic disorders in AD model mice.
Finally, we tested whether blocking the phosphorylation of Add1 can rescue memory impairments and synaptic disorders in AD model mice.
According to our previous experience
We found that only peptide 3 could attenuate the phosphorylation of Add1 in vitro (Fig.
We observed that siP-Add1 had no effect on WT mice, including the bodyweight, open field test, dendritic spines and trees, and LTD (Supplementary Fig.
Our results showed reduced levels of phosphorylated S726-Add1

in vivo (Fig.
Moreover, siP-Add1 administration not only significantly restored the density of dendritic spines (Fig.
Thus, blocking Rock2-mediated phosphorylation of Add1 effectively rescues AD-like synaptic and memory impairments in mice.

Discussion
In this study, we identified that miR-135a-5p, a synaptic-associated miRNA, is abnormally downregulated in AD.
Loss of miR-135a-5p expression results in an increase in Rock2 activity and hyperphosphorylation of Add1 at Ser726, which in turn leads to dendritic abnormalities and memory impairments.
Blocking the miR-135/ Rock2/p-Add1 axis effectively rescued the AD-like synaptic and memory deficits in the APP/PS1 mouse model (Fig.
Recently, we have demonstrated the critical roles of multiple miRNAs in mediating the synaptic disorders of AD
Here, we first screened the alterations in miRNAs associated with the synaptic activity, and of those miRNAs, miR-135a-5p was of particular interest because it showed the most dramatic change in expression in the hippocampus of AD model mice at 9 months.
Although the expression profile of miR-135a-5p in the hippocampal of patients with AD is not clear, some of the high throughout data suggested that miR-135a-5p was downregulated in the gray matter and serum of AD paitents
miR-135a-5p is upregulated by long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity proposed as the primary cellular substrate of learning/ memory
Our data demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-135a-5p in AD is tau dependent because the loss of miR-135a-5p expression in MAPT KO neurons can be induced by tau overexpression but not by either APP or PS1.
In line with this, tau pathology (hyperphosphorylation of Tau) in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice occurs no earlier than 6 months
Soluble tau aggregates inhibit synaptic LTD in vivo
Therefore, tau pathology might play a critical role in mediating miR-135a-5p suppression in AD.
Moreover, we also found no negative correlation of Tau with miR-135a-5p in normal mice, suggesting that the synergism of Aβ and Tau 53 might be important to mediate the downregulation of miR-135a-5p in AD.
In addition, we found that the decrease in miR-135a-5p expression is prominent in excitatory neurons and caused by a decrease in Foxd3 levels in AD.
Foxd3 is a wellknown transcriptional factor that is important for the development of the vertebrate nervous system, including the determination, migration, and differentiation of neural crest lineages
There are many synaptic-related (or brain-enriched) genes, including many miRNAs
Importantly, a study of genome-wide identification of the binding region of Tau in neurons found that an AG-rich motif was present within Tau-binding regions, and Tau acted as a repressor of genes related to Tau-binding
Meanwhile, we found that two of the variant AG-rich motif (GGAGGGAGAG, GGA-GAGAGAG) were present in the promoter region of Foxd3 at -3807 to -3793 in the mouse genome.
It is thus possible that Tau protein especially the pathological Tau could bind and repress the transcription of Foxd3, resulting in a reduction of Foxd3 protein.
Consistently, the direct transcriptional regulation of miR-135a-5p by Foxd3 was identified in our study based on a series of experiments and previous array data.
Thus, the loss of miR-135a-5p expression in AD is Tau dependent and mediated by Foxd3.
Numerous reports have revealed the crucial roles of miRNAs in controlling neuronal morphology and maintaining synaptic plasticity
An image-based miRNome-wide functional miRNA screen in an induced neuronal differential cell model suggested that miR-135a-5p is the potent stimulator for developmental axon growth and branching, cortical neuronal migration, and axon regeneration
Intravitreal injection of miR-135a/b mimic promoted the axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) after optic nerve injury in adult mice.
While miR-135a/b sponge further destroyed the axon regeneration of RGC.
This was consistent with our result that miR-135a-5p promoted dendritic complexity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
Administration of miR-135a inhibitors effectively blocked NMDA-induced spine retraction
These lines of evidence strongly suggest that miR-135a-5p deregulation is correlated with abnormalities in neuronal morphology.
In this study, we found that the loss of miR-135a-5p expression results in a decrease in dendritic complexity and spine maturation, while overexpression of miR-135a-5p in vivo rescues those abnormalities.
Moreover, loss of miR-135a-5p expression induces the reduction in LTP and basal transmission in the CA3-CA1 projection.
This inhibition seems to be a postsynaptic process because we did not observe any differences in the PPF experiment.
However, a recent study reported that overexpression of pre-miR-135a leads to a significant reduction in the number of spines in mouse primary hippocampal neurons
We propose that this discrepancy is due to the different circumstances between the in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the CMV or constitutively active mutant Mef2-vp16 driven overexpression of pre-miR-135a would overwhelm the endogenous miRNA processing machinery
Similar to our research, Liu et al.
In another study, miR-135a-5p knockdown enhances the frequency of sEPSC events in BLA pyramidal neurons
Here, we demonstrated the critical role of miR-135a-5p in regulating postsynaptic maturation in the hippocampus.
Interestingly, targeted knockdown of miR-135a-5p in the amygdala results in anxiety-like behavior in mice
As anxiety is one of the most prevalent psychiatric manifestations in the early stage of AD, administration of miR-135a-5p might be a therapeutic approach for both emotional and cognitive disorders relating to AD. Besides, a series of important studies have demonstrated several other microRNAs, including miR-132-3p, were differentially expressed in response to LTP induction and regulated synaptic proteins relevant to persistent LTP

the important roles of miRNA in the fine-tuning of gene regulation
Our study further demonstrated the important role of Rock2mediated hyperphosphorylation of Add1 in the synaptic/ memory disorder caused by reduced miR-135a-5p expression in AD.
It is well known that posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs has pleiotropic effects, and it is reasonable to speculate that miR-135a-5p participates in synaptic/memory disorders by targeting different target mRNAs.
A previous KEGG analysis in the rat hippocampus suggested that the predicted target genes of miR-135a-5p might be important for LTP and the synaptic vesicle cycle of glutamatergic synapses in AD
Here, we pursued Rock2 as a direct target of miR-135a-5p based on a series of bioinformatics analyses and biochemical validation.
The in vivo experiments further confirmed the remedial effects of silencing Rock2 on dendritic abnormalities and synaptic/memory deficits.
Our study demonstrated that the miR-135a-5p/Rock2 signaling axis is important for actin cytoskeleton dynamics in dendrites and is consistent with a previous in vitro study
Coincidentally, overexpression of miR-135a-5p results in the downregulation of Rock1 and Rock2 expression, which in turn suppresses the in vivo invasion abilities of prostate cancer cells, indicating that this pathway is also implicated in actin cytoskeleton organization in tumors
Moreover, a recent screening series including quantitative proteomic screens and in silico analysis revealed Rock2 as one of six potential main regulators of synaptic and axonal degeneration in vivo
Furthermore, Rock2 knockout mice displayed significant deficits in spine properties and synapse density as well as impairments in basal synaptic transmission and hippocampal LTP
Our data provide evidence that overexpression of Rock2 can also impair dendritic morphology and LTP and affect basal transmission.
Thus, maintaining a certain level of Rock2 is essential for physiological synaptic plasticity.
We also identified the downstream targets of Rock2, such as Add1, that promote synaptic disorders, and disruption of the phosphorylation of Add1 by a specific peptide also rescued dendritic abnormalities and learning memory deficits in AD.
It is known that there are many other substrates of Rock2, such as Limk, Mlc, Crmp2
The application of TAT peptide could specifically block the interaction between Rock2 and Add1 and phosphorylation of S726-Add1 without affecting other substrates
This result provided evidence of a novel therapeutic approach for this devastating disease.
Finally, we speculate that Rock2 might not be the sole downstream target of miR-135a-5p in AD.
Our predicted miR-135a-5p targets include the following genes that are related to the disruption of neuronal morphology remodeling and learning memory in AD: glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (Gsk3b), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (Bace1), glutamate receptor, ionotropic, NMDA2B (epsilon 2) (Grin2b), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), Golgiassociated, gamma adaptin ear containing, ARF binding protein 1 (Gga1), fermitin family member 2 (Fermt2), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9 (Ndufb9), and Ndufa4, mitochondrial complex associated (Ndufa4) (see Supplementary Table
In summary, the results here provide evidence for an important role of the miR-135a-5p/Rock2 signaling pathway in mediating synaptic disorders in AD.
As decreased miR-135a-5p levels have been observed in the gray matter of patients with AD

Fig. 8
Fig.8miR-135a-5p/Rock2/Add1 signal mediates the synaptic/memory impairments in AD.
In normal conditions (left), miR-135a-5p was transcriptionally regulated by Foxd3 and suppressed the Rock2 expression, which was essential for normal synaptic plasticity.
In AD (right), loss of Foxd3 results in the downregulation of miR-135a-5p and the overexpression of Rock2, which in turn caused the hyperphosphorylation of Add1 in the Ser726 site and the aberrant dendritic morphology, as well as the synaptic/ memory impairments.
Blocking the hyperphosphorylation of Add1 by siP-Add1 partially rescued those abnormalities.
