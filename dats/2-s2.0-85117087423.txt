Brothers in arms: proBDNF/BDNF and sAPPα/Aβ-signaling and their common interplay with ADAM10, TrkB, p75NTR, sortilin, and sorLA in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important modulator for a variety of functions in the central nervous system (CNS).
A wealth of evidence, such as reduced mRNA and protein level in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood samples of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients implicates a crucial role of BDNF in the progression of this disease.
Especially, processing and subcellular localization of BDNF and its receptors TrkB and p75 are critical determinants for survival and death in neuronal cells.
Similarly, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key player in Alzheimer's disease, and its cleavage fragments sAPPα and Aβ are known for their respective roles in neuroprotection and neuronal death.
Common features of APP-and BDNF-signaling indicate a causal relationship in their mode of action.
However, the interconnections of APP-and BDNF-signaling are not well understood.
Therefore, we here discuss dimerization properties, localization, processing by αand γ-secretase, relevance of the common interaction partners TrkB, p75, sorLA, and sortilin as well as shared signaling pathways of BDNF and sAPPα.

Introduction: BDNF in Alzheimer's diseasedata derived from human studies
The protein brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in the development and in the maintenance of the nervous system
Its function as a regulator of neural plasticity and survival is well established
In addition, its contribution to different neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases or disorders like diabetes mellitus is well accepted
Especially in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the function of BDNF as a neuroprotective agent is well known.
Several evidences, such as reduced level of BDNF in post-mortem AD brains or decreased level of BDNF in blood samples of patients, implicate a role of BDNF signaling in the pathophysiology of AD
Furthermore, the inverse correlation between BDNF, its receptor TrkB, β-amyloidosis (Aβ plaques), and neurofibrillary tangles within specific regions of postmortem tissue strengthen the link between pathological features of AD and BDNF signaling
However, so far it is unknown whether or to which extent there is a causal relationship or only a coincident occurrence of imbalanced BDNF expression and AD.
The disease itself is characterized by a slow progression of cognitive decline.
In familial AD (FAD), preclinical symptoms are evident up to 25 years before onset of the disease
One of the earliest detectable markers is β-amyloidosis in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus of familial and sporadic AD
β-amyloidosis is followed by hypoconnectivity within the DMN at very early preclinical stages of AD
Dysregulation of the DMN have not only been linked to AD but also to major depressive disorder (MDD)
Interestingly, involvement of BDNF is also suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of MDD
These findings indicate that BDNF might be involved in ketamine-induced changes of functional connectivity of the DMN.
Further risk factors of AD such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease or inactivity have been also associated with imbalances in BDNF signaling
Furthermore, nonmedical therapies like physical activity have been associated with an upregulation of BDNF in human and animal model studies, respectively, and drug-based therapies with classical anti-dementives, such as donepezil, enhanced circulating levels of BDNF in patients
Interestingly, donezepil treatment also shifted APP processing, a key event in progression of AD, from amyloidogenic to the nonamyloidogenic cleavage in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y)
Furthermore,
In addition, BDNF decreased the amount of Aβ released from human neural cells in an α-secretase-dependent manner
This review addresses the important common players of both signaling pathways, which strengthen the assumed interplay of BDNF and APP signaling.

General aspects of BDNF processing, genetic variants and signaling
The secretory protein BDNF is expressed in neural and nonneural tissues and regulates multiple functions like neuroprotection, neurotoxicity, neurogenesis and neural plasticity
Multiple alternatively spliced mRNA variants of BDNF have been described
This precursor protein is translated as proBDNF into the endoplasmic reticulum.
Further posttranslational processing steps take place on its secretory path to the cell surface as well as extracellularly
Proteolytic cleavage of proBDNF by proteases such as furin-like protein convertases PACE4, PC1 or PC5
Proteolytical conversion of proBDNF (32 kDa) to the N-terminal cleavage fragment and mature BDNF (14 kDa) takes place intracellularly as well as extracellularly and depends on different determinants like the molecular equipment of the compartment, the surrounding pH value and calcium ion concentration
Release of proBDNF and mature BDNF is mainly induced by electrical activity in neuronal cells
However, constitutive secretion of BDNF, albeit to a lesser extent, has also been described
Concerning the release of BDNF in regard to Alzheimer's disease, one single nucleotide polymorphism of BDNF which is characterized by an amino acid substitution in the prodomain of BDNF was intensively discussed.
However, so far, there are conflicting results whether this BDNF Val/Met polymorphism is associated with susceptibility or clinical features of AD
On the cellular level, the polymorphism has an impact on sorting and secretion of BDNF
Sorting sequences in the prodomain as well as in the mature domain of BDNF determine the main distribution of the protein to the regulated pathway of secretion
The single nucleotide polymorphism could be associated with an enhanced distribution of BDNF to the constitutive pathway of secretion, thereby reducing activity-dependent secretion of BDNF especially at the synaptic site
However, neuronal and astrocytic release of either processed or unprocessed BDNF plays a major role not only during development of neural networks but also during inflammation, plasticity, and neuroprotective processes
Accordingly, unprocessed and processed BDNF exert different functions by preferentially binding to different receptor classes.
Mature BDNF predominantly activates the TrkB receptor which belongs to the neurotrophin receptor family while proBDNF predominantly activates the p75 receptor, which is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
BDNF-induced homodimerization of TrkB (Table
Heterodimerization of TrkB and p75 as well as heterodimerization of p75 and sortilin have also been described with preferential binding affinities for mature BDNF and proBDNF, respectively (Table
Intracellular signaling cascades which are mediated by p75 receptor leading to activation of c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK), Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB).
A wide spectrum of functions like neuronal survival, neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth but also apoptosis is promoted via p75 signaling
In summary, BDNF signaling via TrkB as well as p75 is important for neuroprotective and neurotoxic function in the CNS.
Sorting of the protein to the specific secretory path as well as subcellular secretion site fine tunes the function of the protein via TrkB or p75 thereby inducing cell survival or cell death in CNS.

General aspects of APP processing and the relevance of its secreted fragments in AD
Processing of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key event in the course of Alzheimer's disease, since toxic Aβ peptides as well as neurotrophic secreted amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα) are both generated under normal physiological conditions and an imbalance in the yield of those fragments is most likely causing the pathological condition of this disease
Toxic secreted Aβ species interact with different types of receptors in the central nervous system leading to synaptic failure and disrupted neuronal homeostasis
APP is processed mainly in two different ways: the non-amyloidogenic and the amyloidogenic pathway (Figure
The amyloidogenic pathway starts with cleavage of APP via β-secretase.
It is known that β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a membrane bound aspartyl protease, is mostly responsible for the enzymatic activity of β-secretase
β-Secretase cleavage results in the release of soluble sAPPβ and generation of the membrane bound ß-CTF.
γ-Secretase is a membrane bound aspartic protease which can cut the ß-CTF liberating Aβ species of various lengths, which can be toxic
In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is firstly cleaved by α-secretase within the Aβ region, thereby precluding Aβ formation
In contrast to β-secretase, several proteases exist that function as α-secretases
These α-secretases are part of "a disintegrin and metalloprotease" (ADAM) family and ADAM10 is suggested to function as α-secretase with the highest physiological relevance for APP processing in neurons
Due to this cleavage, sAPPα is generated as well as the α-C-terminal fragment, which can be further converted by γ-secretase to release the nonpathogenic 3 kDa p3 peptide as well as the intracellular domain AICD.
The secreted sAPPα fragment is known to have neurotrophic functions
α-Cleavage of APP occurs mostly at the cell surface
In the past years, additional APP-processing pathways have been identified which are responsible for the generation of further N-terminally cleaved APP fragments, including the δ-, ηand Meprin pathway reviewed in
In the η-processing pathway, APP can firstly be cleaved at the η-cleavage site 504/505 by matrix metalloproteinase 5 (MT5), a zinc-dependent metalloprotease
Subsequently, βor α-secretase generate two peptides of 92 or 108 amino acids in length, designated as Aη-β or Aη-α peptides, respectively
In contrast to Aη-β, recombinant or synthetic Aη-α was reported to lower LTP as well as hippocampal neuronal activity in vivo and is therefore considered to be synaptotoxic
The mammalian δ-secretase, also known for its synaptotoxic effects, facilitates the amyloidogenic pathway.
δ-secretase (or Asparagine endopeptidase) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that cleaves after asparagine residues
Activation of δ-secretase is autocatalytic and requires sequential removal of C-and N-terminal propeptides at different pH thresholds
δ-secretase cleaves APP at residues N373 and N585 in the E2 domain of the APP ectodomain (Figure
Position N585 is located only 11 aa N-terminal to the β-secretase cleavage site in APP at position D596.
This is in line with results from a different study showing that inhibition of δ-secretase reduced β-secretase cleavage of APP and thereby improved cognitive functions in an AD mouse model
Furthermore, the δ-secretase-cleaved APP (586-695) fragment was shown to induce amyloid plaques, synaptic impairments, and cognitive defects
In summary, APP processing is important for neuroprotective and neurotoxic function in the CNS.
Processing of the protein by different secretases fine tunes the production of Aβ and sAPPα thereby inducing cell survival or cell death in CNS.

Cleavage fragments and common players in BDNF and APP-signaling
Processing and subcellular localization of BDNF and its signaling partners as well as APP and its cleavage fragments are critical determinants for survival and death of neuronal cells.
Both signaling pathways are linked via crosstalk and feedback mechanism.
Important common players of sorting and processing of BDNF receptors and APP like α-secretase, γ-secretase, sortilin and sorLA indicate a relationship of both signaling pathways and may regulate the balance between neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
In the following, we discuss the relationship between The following abbreviations are used: FRET, Foerster resonance energy transfer; EM, electron microscopy; FLIM, fluorescence lifetime imaging; SEC-SAXS, size exclusion chromatography-small angle X-ray scattering.
cleavage fragments and common players in BDNF and APP-signaling by addressing dimerization properties, localization and processing.
sAPPα: general aspects sAPPα is a neuroprotective and neurotrophic protein, derived from the parent APP molecule.
It has synaptogenic, LTP facilitating and memory enhancing properties
A different aspect of the physiological function of sAPPα is its ability to stimulate proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs)
sAPPα also plays an essential role in survival of neurons shown in different cell culture studies
The identity of the sAPPα receptor is not fully resolved yet, but different studies implied a role of GABAB
A wealth of data suggested NMDA receptors as a receptor for sAPPα
These results are in line with reports showing that full length APP can interact with GluN1/ GluN2 receptors and enhance their cell surface expression
A recent study demonstrated that sAPPα-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons is mediated via cooperation of NMDA and α7-nAChRs receptors, resulting in enhanced transcription and translation of Arc via CaMKII, MAPK, and PKG signaling
Similar to BDNF, nanomolar amounts of sAPPα promote a gradual increase in Arc mRNA, but with a stronger effect for BDNF
This is in accordance with an earlier investigation which identified α7-nAChRs as a crucial physiological receptor for sAPPα for its LTP facilitating function
This signaling pathway is paralleled by BDNF that can modulate neuronal output in part by controlling α7-nAChR levels
The contribution of BDNF to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus but also in many other brain areas is well known
Similar, LTP-inducing stimuli release BDNF and also release/generate sAPPα (see below) which makes it likely that both factors cooperate during hippocampal LTP.
Interestingly, also donezepil treatment of cells suggested again that sAPPa and BDNF are players in the same neurotrophic pathway.
Increased neurite elongation and improved cell viability have been shown through activations of PI3K, BDNF, β-catenin and α7-nAChR receptors by a combinatorial mixture of donezepil, cilostazol plus aripiprazole, which also activated ADAM10 leading presumably to increased sAPPα levels

Production of sAPPα and similarities to BDNF release
Several stimuli like high frequency stimulation (HFS) of hippocampal neurons
Interestingly, similar stimuli have been described to induce release of BDNF (Figure
For example, BDNF secretion was shown to depend on mGluR1 activation in different cell types
Furthermore, HFS is a well-known stimulus to induce activity-dependent secretion of BDNF in hippocampal neurons as well as in other brain areas
Just as for sA PPα, release of BDNF was described to be frequency-dependent and could be blocked by TTX
Electrically induced BDNF release upregulates the TrkB receptormediated PLC/PKC-signaling cascade during hippocampal LTP
Furthermore, calcium influx via NMDA receptors contributes to BDNF release
While the time course of BDNF release as well as the cellular source of BDNF is intensively analyzed, similar investigations are missing for the release/cleavage of sAPPα.
Merely quantifying the amount of sAPPα by Western blots does not clarify the original cellular source of sAPPα or whether the increase in extracellular cleavage product is derived from exocytosis of sAPPα-containing vesicles or from processing of APP at surface membrane
Though, it was reported that a small number of synaptic vesicles contains APP, which can be released during neuronal activity
While BDNF is immediately secreted into extracellular space after electrical stimulation
Therefore, release of BDNF and release of sAPPα, respectively, might occur on a different time scale.
However, it needs to be clarified whether BDNF supports only nonamyloidogenic processing of APP

Role of sAPPα during neurite outgrowth: resemblance to BDNF signaling
Early studies in AD research already demonstrated that, similar to BDNF, sAPPα can promote neurite
Several APP domains in the extracellular part of the protein seem to be involved in these functions, including the N-terminal APP96-110 region located in the first heparin-binding domain and the APP319-335 region, which contains the RERMS motif within the E2 domain
In addition, various studies investigated the signaling pathways involved in neurite extension due to sAPPα.
Chasseigneux et al., for example, demonstrated that both, sAPPα and sAPPβ, were able to specifically enhance axonal growth at nanomolar concentrations via early growth response protein 1 (Egr1) signaling in cultures of embryonic cortical neurons (Figure
BDNF/TrkB signaling was also shown to increase Egr1 expression in primary neurons through activation of MAPK signaling (Figure
However, dendritic and not axonal differentiation was mediated via BDNF/Egr1-dependent mechanism
Another report indicated that sAPPα as well as depolarization induced neurite elongation and that both, sAPPα and depolarization, induced MAPK/ERK signaling via activation of NMDA receptors (Figure

Neuroprotective function of sAPPα and interconnections to BDNF
There is also evidence for sAPPα-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms.
Several studies suggested that the neuroprotective function of sAPPα results from activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/Akt)
In the case of sAPPα, this pathway can either be mediated via binding of sAPPα to full length APP followed by activation of a trimeric G protein via the APP C-terminus
Synthetic sAPPα, acting through IGF-1R and insulin receptors stimulated Akt-GSK-3β phosphorylation in N2a cultures, thereby indicating a neuroprotective mechanism in aging AD mice
Interestingly, BDNF and IGF-1, are upregulated in response to physical exercise that might counteract memory impairment upon aging
It was further reported that survival-promoting properties of sAPPα are possibly mediated by the ability of sAPPα to activate NF-κB and to stabilize Ca 2+ homeostasis (Figure
In line with this, a different study showed that sAPPα activates NF-κB transcription in hippocampal neurons, which was neuroprotective
Exposure of neurons to sAPPα resulted in a decrease in the level of IκB and an increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity, both of which were blocked by wortmannin, suggesting that the transcription factor NF-κB may be a downstream target of the PI3K-Akt pathway (Figure
BDNF has also been reported to regulate NF-κB expression via TrkB activation as well as p75 receptor
However, cellular functions mediated via BDNF/NF-κB signaling are dependent on cell type as well as on developmental stage
While BDNF and NDMAR-dependent increase in NF-κB-induced gene transcription promoted survival of granule cell cultures
Further studies need to clarify, whether convergence of BDNF and sAPPα signaling might protect from age-related changes in NF-κB function.
Neuroprotective functions of BDNF and sAPPα have also been demonstrated to be regulated by physical exercise.
Acute exercise leads to two to three-fold increased BDNF levels compared to resting conditions and correlates positively with amelioration in cognitive functions in humans
A recent study indicated that after a three-week running wheel exercise of ∼7-9 month old APP/Presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double mutant transgenic mice showed significantly increased levels of sAPPα and BDNF with concomitant reductions of Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the hippocampus of this AD mouse model
This is in line with results from different reports which demonstrated that increased physical activity decreases Aβ levels in different mouse or rat models of AD
Interestingly, different training durations did not lead to ameliorations on a transcriptional level in three-month-old 5xFAD
BDNF did not induce increased ADAM10 expression, but its redistribution from the cell surface to intracellular locations.
This finding is in line with reports, which suggest that regulated α-secretase activity occurs intracellularly
Conclusively, BDNF-mediated upregulation of α-secretase processing of APP might be one mechanism how exercise protects the brain against AD

Aβ toxicity
Aβ toxicity plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease.
There are several Aβ species generated of which Aβ40 is the major isoform
However, less abundant species such as Aβ42 and its N-terminally truncated isoforms show a stronger aggregation behavior and higher neurotoxicity
Among the Aβ species studied so far, Aβ25-35 represents the shortest fragment of Aβ peptides processed in vivo and is one of the most toxic species by inducing neuronal loss

Mutual influence of Aβ and BDNF expression
Concerning BDNF-signaling, the neurotrophic factor has been shown to prevent neuronal toxicity induced by
Treatment of cells with a Trk inhibitor K252A before exogenous application of BDNF, completely blocked the protective effects of BDNF against Aβ toxicity, showing that these effects involve TrkB receptor activation
Consistent with these findings, it could be demonstrated that BDNF reduced Aβ levels in vitro
Furthermore, BDNF deprivation enhanced Aβ content in extracellular medium of hippocampal and cortical cultures
In turn, Aβ application resulted in a biphasic response on BDNF mRNA level showing an early increase
Furthermore, mature BDNF was reduced after intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 in rodent hippocampus
In addition, fibrillary Aβ25-35 selectively increases the mRNA level of BDNF receptor isoform TrkB-T1 which is described as a dominant negative regulator of full length TrkB.
Additionally, Aβ25-35 promotes truncation of full length TrkB by calpain (see also chapter "TrkB isoform expression in AD" and "proteolytic truncation of TrkB in AD")
All these data indicate that Aβ and BDNF influence expression and processing of each other.

Influence of Aβ on BDNF trafficking
Besides the impact of Aβ species on BDNF expression and cleavage, transport of BDNF-containing vesicles was also affected by Aβ.
Already acute application of Aβ1-42 oligomers reduced the speed of BDNF-containing vesicles in hippocampal neurons
Long term treatment with Aβ or overexpression of hAPP dramatically changed the dynamics of anterograde and retrograde BDNF transport
Aβ-induced deficits in BDNF transport were described to be independent of tau protein and were mediated by calcineurin-dependent activation of GSK3β (Figure
Interestingly, transport deficits of BDNF-containing vesicles have been also observed in young 5xFAD hippocampal cultures
This transgenic mouse line is characterized by a rapid accumulation of Aβ1-42, starting at the age of 1.5 months
Deficits in BDNF transport kinetics could be already observed at DIV 12 in these cultures
In the same AD mouse model, numbers of Ca 2+ -oscillations as well as numbers of cells exhibiting Ca 2+ -activity were significantly reduced at DIV 21
Changes in Ca 2+ -oscillations could be reproduced by chronic Aβ1-42 application and neuronal network activity was disturbed as revealed by multi-electrode array measurements in cultures of hippocampal wildtype neurons
These effects of Aβ1-42 on neuronal networks could be prevented to a large extent by additional BDNF application
In neuronal cells, the influence of Aβ on transport of BDNF-containing vesicles seems to be specific, since Aβ itself neither had an influence on high potassium-induced release of BDNF
In addition to the impact of Aβ on BDNF transport, the precursor APP might also influence BDNF transport by acting as a motor-cargo linker for BDNF-containing vesicles
Further studies need to clarify the putative function of APP in transport of BDNF-containing vesicles.

Conclusive remarks on the interplay of Aβ and BDNF
There are further links between BDNF signaling and the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP
Conclusively, Aβ-induced reductions in LTP could be rescued by BDNF
However, this rescue was, at least partially, dependent on inhibition of Ca 2+ -influx through NMDAR, thereby reducing cleavage of full length TrkB by calpain (Figure
In addition, cognitive impairment could be recovered by BDNF via Erk activation after intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 (Figure
In this line, cognitive impairment was also rescued by BDNF-signaling in transgenic AD mice

TrkB receptor: general aspects to TrkB expression in AD
The TrkB receptor belongs to the neurotrophin receptor family.
Three of the alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms, namely full length TrkB, TrkB-T1 and TrkB-T-Shc, have been implicated in the pathology of AD
The most prominent isoform, the full length TrkB, consists of leucine-rich motifs, cysteinerich domains and immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region and an intracellular catalytic kinase domain (Figure
Gene expression of full length TrkB inversely correlated with antemortem cognitive assessment measures as well as diffuse Aβ plaques in the entorhinal cortex
The two other isoforms associated with AD, TrkB-T1 and the TrkB-T-Shc, are characterized by a truncation of the intracellular tail, and lack the intracellular catalytic domain
In contrast to TrkB-T1, TrkB-T-Shc still contains the shc-binding site in the juxtamembrane region (see also chapter proteolytic truncation of TrkB in AD)
While activation of full length TrkB is mainly associated with neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity, the truncated isoforms are described as dominant negative regulators of full length TrkB.
Alterations in the relative ratio of truncated TrkB receptors to full length TrkB may tilt the balance between neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects in AD

Proteolytic truncation of TrkB in AD
In addition to alternative splicing of TrkB, proteolytic truncation of the receptor was also suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease
δ-Secretase, which facilitates the shift from nonamyloidogenic processing to the amyloidogenic pathway for APP
Cleavage of TrkB as well as APP by δ-secretase was diminished after translocation of both receptors into the TGN via early endosomes and this translocation was controlled by TrkB-induced phosphorylation of APP
The interaction of TrkB and APP at the cell surface was shown to be dependent on the intracellular TrkB catalytic domain as well as on the intracellular domain of APP (Figure
The association of TrkB and APP at the surface membrane was characterized to be BDNF-independent and was also reduced in human AD brains
However, BDNF-induced TrkB activation was essential for phosphorylation of APP and translocation of the protein to the TGN
In addition to δ-secretase, the Ca 2+ -dependent protease calpain was shown to induce truncation of full-length TrkB downstream of the shc-binding site in an Aβ-dependent manner (Figures
Activation of calpain and cleavage of the TrkB receptor could be prevented by the NDMA receptor antagonist memantine
In line with this, NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity was also efficient to stimulate TrkB cleavage by calpain (Figure
For TrkBICD cleaved by calpain, accumulation of the fragments in the nucleus and phosphorylation of nuclear as well as cytosolic proteins have been demonstrated
Besides calpain cleavage, regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of TrkB receptor has been shown to be initiated by NMDA excitotoxicity.
Shedding of full-length TrkB as well as the TrkB-T1 ectodomain by an unknown metalloproteinase (MMP) (see also chapter ADAM10) followed by γ-secretase cleavage of the intracellular domain of both isoforms could be demonstrated in primary cortical cultures (Figure
The shedded ectodomain of TrkB was associated with reduced BDNF signaling due to scavenging of BDNF from extracellular space.
However, function of the γ-secretase cleaved-intracellular domain of full length TrkB or TrkB-T1 is still unknown.
Direct transcriptional regulation of gene expression could be one of the possible functions of the intracellular fragments
Indirect transcriptional regulation of APP gene expression has been already shown to depend on full-length TrkB receptor activation by exogenous BDNF in SH-SY5Y cells (Ruiz-Leon and Pascual 2001).
Furthermore, BDNF application stimulated APP promoter activity in TrkB-expressing SH-SY5Y cells (Ruiz-Leon and Pascual 2003) thereby strengthening the non-amyloidogenic pathway by enhancing the production of sAPPα
However, so far, it is unknown whether BDNF rescues TrkB from proteolytic cleavage within the intracellular domain, thereby mediating gene expression by cytosolic signaling molecules and promoting neuroprotective functions of TrkB.

p75 receptor: general aspects
The p75 neurotrophin receptor belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily.
Binding of mature BDNF as well as proBDNF to the p75 receptor has been described.
It is proposed that mature BDNF binds to p75/TrkB heterodimers while proBDNF has a higher binding affinity to the p75/sortilin complex
Full-length p75 consists of extracellular cysteine-rich domains, an intracellular juxtamembrane chopper domain and an intracellular C-terminal death domain (Figure
Neuroprotective as well as neurotoxic activities have been associated with BDNF-and proBDNF-dependent activation of p75

Interactions of p75 with APP and its cleavage products
In addition to BDNF-signaling through p75, this neurotrophin receptor has been shown to interact with APP, sAPPα, sAPPβ, and Aβ, respectively, thereby inducing either neuroprotective or neurotoxic function (Figure
Interactions of p75 and APP were partially reduced in the presence of neurotrophins and Aβ, respectively, indicating competing binding sites for the respective ligands
Furthermore, α-secretase mediated cleavage of APP was reduced in the presence of p75, while γ-secretase cleavage of β-CTF was increased under the same conditions, leading to enhanced cell death in neuroblastoma cells via caspase-3 activation
This is in line with observations from
Aβ itself has also been shown to interact with p75 receptor, thereby inducing neurotoxicity
In contrast, neuronal viability was significantly enhanced due to reduced internalization and sorting of APP/p75 complex to β-secretase containing compartments in cultures of 5xFAD mice lacking death domain of p75
In line, sAPPα has been shown to bind to p75 ectodomain, thereby inducing neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons
For APP, homodimerization as well as heterodimerization with p75, TrkB, sorLA and sortilin is known.
Interaction of p75 and APP are reduced in the presence of neurotrophins and Aβ, respectively, indicating competing binding sites for the respective ligands.
APP interacts further with sorLA and sortilin, respectively, via the intracellular region as well as via the ectodomain.
In addition, the neurotrophin receptor p75 interacts with its coreceptor sortilin.
Homodimerization of p75 and sortilin, respectively, has also been demonstrated.
Only for sorLA, homodimerization could not be demonstrated.
While sorLA seems to be predominantly located in cholesterol-and sphingomyelin rich lipid raft domains (membrane stained in rose), sortilin is more efficiently sorted to nonrafts domains (membrane stained in grey).
TrkB translocates from non-raft to lipid raft domains after BDNF-binding.
Recruitment of p75 to lipid rafts seems to be also dependent on ligand binding.
In general, however, localization of the mentioned receptors to lipid raft or non-raft regions is not well understood.
Distribution of p75/sortilin heterodimers or TrkB/sortilin heterodimer can only be speculated due to the predominant localization of sortilin to non-rafts.

Proteolytic truncation of p75 in AD
Just like TrkB, p75 can be truncated by different proteases within the extracellular and intracellular domain
Shedding of p75, by the α-secretases ADAM17 or ADAM 10 lead to the generation of a soluble 55 kDa ectodomain (p75ECD) and a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (p75CTF)
This shedding event was dependent on BDNF-induced TrkB activation
Predominant localization of full length p75 at the plasma membrane indicates ectodomain shedding at the surface of the cell
The soluble ECD of p75 was shown to contribute to cellular protection
Cleavage of p75 by α-secretase precedes cleavage of the intracellular domain (p75ICD) by γ-secretase
While this short transmembrane region of the receptor specifically increased activation of TrkB at surface membrane
Cleavage of p75ICD by γ-secretase was significantly diminished in the presence of TrkB receptor
Although soluble p75ICD was often described as unstable, there is also evidence that p75ICD translocates into the nucleus in a BDNF and proBDNFdependent manner (see also chapter sortilin)
Furthermore, proBDNF modified by ROS-derived advanced glycation end products, which was significantly increased in CSF and brains of AD patients, also induced the translocation of p75ICD into the nucleus thereby mediating neurotoxicity

Subcellular localization of p75 in AD
In addition to the importance of proteolytic processing of p75 receptor, subcellular localization of the receptor influences its signaling.
Full length p75 is present in lipid rafts as well as in non-raft regions
Receptor surface diffusion was described to depend on cholesterol level in the plasma membrane with highest diffusibility of p75 in cholesterol-depleted conditions
Proteolytic p75CTF was absent in lipid rafts and cholesterol depletion results in increased shedding of p75NTR
Furthermore, proBDNF-induced apoptotic signaling via p75 receptor was abolished in cholesterol depleted conditions while mutated p75 characterized by a reduced localization in lipid rafts was only able to mediate proBDNF-induced apoptosis after cholesterol administration in cortical neurons
However, it must be pointed out, that cholesterol on its own influences receptor function.

Sortilin: general aspects
Sortilin (Sort1, neurotensin receptor3, gp95) is a type I transmembrane protein which functions as an endocytosis receptor and plays a role in protein sorting as well as cell signaling
The ectodomain of sortilin is mainly formed by the Vps10p domain, which consists of three domains: a ten-bladed β-propeller and two 10CC domains (10CC-a and 10CC-b) that were shown to interact with the β-propeller
In general, sortilin is located predominantly in the TGN and cycles between endosomes and TGN similarly as sorLA
It is trafficked via the secretory pathway and might transport ligands anterogradely
After reaching the plasma membrane, predominantly in non-lipid rafts
Sortilin itself is synthesized as an inactive precursor which is cleaved by the protease Furin to remove a 44 aa propeptide resulting in the mature form of the receptor
Furthermore, the metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 process sortilin in the juxtamembrane region, leading to shedding of its extracellular domain from the cell surface
Sortilin can also subsequently be cleaved by γ-secretase (Figure

Sortilin and APP function
Sortilin full length protein levels as well as CTFs were found to be significantly increased in brains of AD patients
This is in line with the findings that sortilin is an important regulator of amyloidogenic APP processing.
Sortilin overexpression increased BACE1 cleavage of APP thereby elevating Aβ production
However, results from two studies demonstrated increased amyloid plaque pathology in two different AD mouse models crossed with sortilin KO mice
Furthermore,
Besides modulation of APP processing, sortilin functions as a neuronal receptor for APP and its cleavage products sAPPα and Aβ
Sortilin interacts with APP via the intracellular region as well as via the ectodomain (Figure
The binding site in the APP ectodomain was mapped to amino acids 1-141 within the growth factor-like domain (GFLD) which is part of the E1 domain.
A different report mapped the APP-sortilin interaction site further distal to the E1 domain within the APP ectodomain
In addition to APP, oligomerized Aβ has also been shown to bind sortilin, thereby inducing endocytosis of Aβ as well as apoptosis
For sAPPα, sortilin-dependent binding as well as internalization into different intracellular compartments has been shown
The extracellular domain of APP was reported to interact with sortilin in a pH dependent manner with higher ligand-binding affinity at neutral pH and inhibition at an acidic pH, supporting the assumption that sAPPα binds sortilin at the cell surface
In contrast, homo-dimerization of sortilin has been shown to depend on an acidic pH value (Figure
Indeed, earlier studies have already demonstrated that interaction of sortilin with several such as the receptor associated protein (RAP) is lost at acidic pH
It was also suggested that sortilin homodimerization promotes its trafficking to the TGN and to extracellular vesicles

Sortilin and BDNF-signaling
It has been proposed that proneurotrophins (proNT) released by neurons and glial cells potentiate cellular apoptosis, thereby contributing to the marked loss of neurons in brains of AD patients
An increased release of proNT plays a significant role in neuronal death involving receptor-mediated apoptosis
In this context, sortilin is an essential component for transmitting proneurotrophin-dependent death signals from p75NTR
In the death receptor complex, sortilin binds the pro-domain of pro-neurotrophins with high affinity forming a receptor complex with p75 that initiates apoptotic signaling
The mechanism by which sortilin and p75NTR transmit the apoptotic signal into cells is not completely understood, but involves JNK phosphorylation and the γ-secretase dependent release of the intracellular domain (ICD) of p75NTR, followed by nuclear translocation of the DNAbinding protein neurotrophin receptor inducing factor (NRIF)
The interaction of sortilin with p75NTR induces neuronal apoptosis, presumably increasing AD severity
This assumption is underlined by the finding of increased protein levels of proBDNF as well as its co-receptor sortilin in brains from AD patients which are both key signaling components involved in pro-apoptotic effects
Immunohistochemical analyses of brain slices of AD patients revealed a significantly increased number of apoptotic cells positive for p75 and sortilin
Interestingly, a different study showed that Aβ42 oligomers enhanced sortilin gene and protein expression via p75NTR and RhoA signaling pathways, suggesting a potential physiological interaction of Aβ42, proneurotrophins, p75 and sortilin in Alzheimer's disease
In contrast, sortilin is also known to bind neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF
Earlier reports indicated that expression of the soluble sortilin ectodomain results in an increase in constitutive release of BDNF relative to cells expressing full length sortilin
Both, sortilin as well as BDNF are transported to lysosomes where they are degraded.
This sortilin-dependent degradation was shown to depend on the C-terminus of sortilin
Furthermore, sortilin has been reported to associate with TrkB receptors
Sortilin binds Trk receptors to facilitate their anterograde trafficking and enhances Trk survival signaling by neurotrophins
Therefore, sortilin acts as a molecular switch either by interacting with p75NTR resulting in an apoptotic response or binding TrkB receptors to induce neurotrophic effects.

SorLa: general aspects
SorLA (LR11) is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of an N-terminal VPS10 domain, followed by a YWTD/ EGF-like domain, and multiple LDL receptor/FN3 repeats in the ectodomain (Figure
Evidence suggests that sorLA might act as an sAPPα receptor
APP as well as sAPPα bind sorLA (Figure
The interaction domain in APP has been mapped to its carbohydrate (E2) domain and to the CR domains 5-8 of sorLA
Of note, sorLA also binds soluble Aβ via its VPS10P domain and targets it for lysosomal degradation
If sorLA also acts as a homodimer as demonstrated for p75
Interestingly, sorLA itself is cleaved by the α-secretase ADAM17

SorLa and APP function
A possible implication of sorLA in AD was suggested by the finding of reduced levels of shedded sorLA in CSF
This is in line with studies showing that sorLA knockout mice exhibit higher Aβ levels in the brain as compared to WT mice
The effect of sorLA on the proteolytic conversion of APP has been demonstrated to be based on the impact of sorLA on APP transport, since the route by which APP is trafficked determines by which enzymes APP is proteolytically converted.
SorLA is mainly localized to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes while only a minor fraction is present at the plasma membrane
There, sorLA may be involved in segregating APP CTFs into lipid rafts and excluding APP FL protein from lipid raft domains
Various studies indicate that sorLA can promote APP trafficking from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus
According to this, co-expression of sorLA and APP led to a significant decrease of stationary vesicles and anterograde vesicles with a concomitant marked increase in the number of retrograde vesicles in primary cortical mouse neurons, suggesting that sorLA is mainly implicated in retrograde transport of APP
The aforementioned data suggest that sorLA acts as a neuronal receptor.
There is evidence that sAPPα downregulates cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 5 activity by binding to the sorLA receptor, which is essential to exert the trophic functions of sAPPα in neurons
Interestingly, the sAPPα-sorLA interaction increased expression of hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 (ORP150) as effector protein which potentially mediates neuroprotective functions of sAPPα, thereby functioning as a protective chaperone

SorLA and BDNF-signaling
SorLA protein expression is significantly reduced in BDNF KO mice
Furthermore, application of BDNF increases sorLA protein levels and thereby inhibits Aβ production in WT but not in sorLA KO neurons
Therefore, the impact of BDNF on APP processing in regard to reduced Aβ production, seems to be mediated via sorLA, supporting the idea of a neuroprotective function of sorLA.
A different study demonstrated that sorLA interacts with TrkB (Figure
Interaction with sorLA controls trafficking and synaptic exposure of TrkB since both, anterograde and retrograde transport of TrkB-eGFP containing vesicles was impaired in sorLA KO neurons.
Additionally, treatment of sorLA KO neurons with BDNF results in significantly reduced phosphorylation of TrkB, ERK, and Akt compared to WT neurons
These data support a concept, where interaction with sorLA facilitates neuritic transport of TrkB to and from the synapse, thereby promoting BDNF signal transduction

ADAM10
A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) has been identified as the major α-secretase acting on APP in neurons
In addition, ADAM17, also designated TACE, can exert α-secretase activity
Interestingly, both proteases have been identified as participating in neurotrophin receptor cleavage: and TrkA have been demonstrated to be shedded by ADAM17 as well as ADAM10
The protease involved in the latter regulatory scenario has not been identified yet.
However, as ADAM10 is inducible by NMDA receptor activity, by calcium influx into the cell, or by glutamate
This shedding results in a soluble receptor ectodomain that scavenges BDNF within the extracellular space
Contrarily, to this impairing function of ADAM10 on BDNF, the protease also might positively act on the factors' bioavailability.
ADAM10 was identified as the preferred protease cleaving sortilin (Figure
The expression of the respective sortilin ectodomain released by this processing prevents BDNF translocation to the lysosomal department and its subsequent degradation
The interaction between the α-secretase and BDNF seems also to be mutual: at least in the context of retinoic acid signaling, BDNF has been shown to augment activity of the α-secretase, resulting in elevated release of sAPPα
Such a coregulation has also been described for restoration of retinoic acid supply to SH-SY5Y cells
More recently, an increase of BDNF could also be observed in AD model mice treated with the synthetic retinoid acitretin
Not only did the treatment rebalance excitatory synapses in the visual cortex, it also increased the amount of BDNF.

Conclusions and future directions
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a slow progression of cognitive decline and preclinical symptoms are evident up to 25 years before onset of the disease.
One may ask whether cellular processes are really responsible for the outbreak of this disease or whether subtle dysregulations of interconnected networks rather lead to the massive brain disorder.
Due to this lack of knowledge, it is also unknown if there exists a point of no return on progression of neuronal cell death or whether there is a time point at which the cognitive decline can be stopped and not just delayed.
Regardless of the original cause of AD, dysregulations or disorders can be treated by drugs which mostly elicit their responses at cellular level.
In addition, cellular changes and adaptive responses are ultimately the main cause of dysregulation at higher levels.
The knowledge about the balance of this cellular functions as well as adaptive responses allows us to find medical or nonmedical therapies to treat Alzheimer's disease maybe even before massive neuronal cell death occurs.
Therefore, further studies will need to address the complexity of signaling pathways with all its properties like synergistic effects, feedforward and feedback loop, crosstalk as well as spatial and temporal dynamics.
APP and BDNF signaling are described to be independent pathways which are linked via crosstalk and feedback mechanism e.g., on gene expression level.
However, several common features concerning sorting and processing of BDNF receptors and APP strengthen a causal relationship of both signaling pathways:
-The balance of proBDNF/BDNF-signaling as well as the balance of sAPPα/Aβ cleavage significantly contributes to neuroprotective and neurotoxic functions.
Quantification of protein ratios e.g. in brain tissue, CSF and blood samples of patients could be used as an indicator of early stages of the disease.
-Similar stimuli induce release of BDNF and also promote α-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP.
However, whether both proteins can be co-released e.g. during LTP or learning and memory is unknown.
Furthermore, common stimuli to induce BDNF and sAPPα release such as forskolin might function as a pharmacological drug.
-BDNF/TrkB signaling and sAPPα activate common intracellular signaling pathways e.g. during NMDAdependent plasticity processes or neuroprotection.
Whether both pathways are connected in parallel thereby converging on the same intracellular signaling molecules or whether these pathways are connected in series (e.g. by translocation of the respective receptors) is unknown.
-Aβ and BDNF negatively influence expression and processing of each other.
In addition, transport of BDNF is affected by Aβ, thereby potentially balancing plasticity processes and neuronal excitotoxicity.
-p75 receptor exhibits binding capacity to BDNF and its signaling partners as well as to APP and its cleavage products, respectively, therefore making this receptor suitable to bridge or even to combine both pathways.
-APP, TrkB, p75, sorLa and sortilin directly interact with each other.
Whether the receptors heteromultimerize needs to be clarified by protein-protein interaction studies.
Pharmacological drugs which inhibit specific protein-protein interactions like p75 and full length APP could be a new therapeutical approach.
-Proteolytic cleavage of TrkB, p75, APP, sorLa and sortilin share common features.
It is unknown whether cutting of receptors takes place simultaneously in the di-or multimeric complex.
Analysis of soluble protein fragments as well as quantification of protein ratios in brain tissue, CSF and blood samples of patients might help to reveal molecular characteristics of AD thereby potentially uncovering new biomarkers of the disease.
-SorLA and sortilin are likely to separate lipid raft from non-raft signaling routes of APP, TrkB and p75, respectively, thereby influencing aspects of sorting as well as the degree of intracellular enzyme activation or inhibition.
Future research will reveal the impact of BDNF and APP interplay as well as interactions with the other signaling partners in AD diagnosis and therapy.



Figure 1 :
Figure 1: Classical canonical amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP processing.
The different secretases (α, β and γ) and their respective cleavage site are shown.
The non-amyloidogenic pathway is initiated by α-secretase cleavage of APP.
Thereby, soluble APPα (sAPPα) is released of the remaining C-terminal fragment, containing the APP Intracellular C-terminal domain (AICD) and the fragment p3.
In the next step, the p3 fragment is cleaved off by γ-secretase.
In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by β-secretase and disintegrates into soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) and the membrane retained C-terminal fragment, containing the AICD and the Aβ region.
This C-terminal fragment can be further cleaved by γ-secretase leading to the release of AICD and the Aβ peptide, which can form neurotoxic oligomers.
The following abbreviations are used: β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase), anterior-pharynx-defective protein-1 (APH-1), presenilin enhancer protein-2 (PEN-2).



Figure 2 :
Figure 2: Domain structures and cleavage sites of APP-and BDNF-signaling partners.
Schematic representation of APP, sorLA, sortilin, p75 and TrkB receptor illustrates extracellular and intracellular domains of the different transmembrane proteins as well as the respective cleavage sites of the different proteases.
The extracellular domain of APP consists of E1 linked by an acidic domain to E2. δ-secretase cleaves APP at residues N373 and N585 at the respective boundaries of the E2 domain.
αand β-secretase cleave the ectodomain of APP in the juxtamembrane region leading to the cleavage products sAPPα or sAPPβ, respectively.
γ-secretase cleavage of APP is responsible for the generation of AICD.
The co-receptors sorLA and sortilin share similar domain structures.
Both consist of an extracellular Vps10 domain and an intracellular adaptor binding site.
In addition, sorLA contains of multiple LDLR repeats and Fn type III domain.
Both, sorLA and sortilin have been shown to be proteolytically processed by αand γ-secretase in juxtamembrane regions.
TrkB recognizes BDNF with its leucine-rich domain and one of the Ig-like domains.
The intracellular catalytic tyrosine kinase domain mediates intracellular signaling transduction.
TrkB can be cleaved by δ-secretase in the boundary of Ig-like domain 2 leaving the ligand binding domain of TrkB.
Furthermore, TrkB can be cleaved by α-secretase in the juxtamembrane region which results in the generation of a longer ECD of TrkB as cleaved by δ-secretase.
On the intracellular site, cleavage of TrkB by γ-secretase and δ-secretase upstream of the shc-binding site has been described as well as cleavage of TrkB by calpain in between the shc-binding site and the kinase domain of TrkB.
P75 includes cysteine-rich domains in the extracellular region as well as one chopper domain and one death domain in the intracellular part of the protein.
Cleavage of p75 by αand γ-secretase has been reported.
In contrast to TrkB, p75 contains no catalytic domain.
Activation of p75 is postulated by uncovering of intracellular signaling site after ligand-binding-induced conformational change of the receptor.
The following abbreviations are used: Vps10P (Vacuolar protein sorting 10), AICD (APP intracellular domain), LDLR (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor), Fn type III (fibronectin type III), Ig (immunoglobulin-like), APP (Amyloid precursor protein), TrkB (Tropomyosin receptor kinase B), sorLA (sortilin-related receptor) L (DLR class) A.



Figure 3 :
Figure 3: Production of sAPPα and similarities to BDNF release.
Several stimuli like high frequency stimulation (HFS), activation of NMDAR, AMPAR and mGluR1 have been reported to promote α-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP as well as release of BDNF.
However, release of BDNF and production of sAPPα, respectively, might occur on a different time scale.


) (Gakhar-Koppole et al. 2008).
Depolarization-induced ERK phosphorylation was evident on a very fast time scale after activation of NMDAR while acute addition of sAPPα alone did not lead to ERK activation.
However, inhibition of APP processing by α-secretases prevented depolarization-induced neurite outgrowth and continuous generation of sAPPα was necessary for depolarization-induced ERK phosphorylation, indicating that sAPPα promotes MAPK⁄ERK translocation by an unknown mechanism (Gakhar-Koppole et al. 2008).
Interestingly, Patterson et al. (2001) described different forms of electrically induced BDNF-dependent LTP that required phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of phosphorylated MAPK (Figure 4).
While adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin increased MAPK phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism, translocation of the activated MAPK was dependent on BDNF/ TrkB signaling (Patterson et al. 2001).
BDNF/TrkB signaling might therefore support translocation of phosphorylated MAPK which in turn is activated via depolarizationdependent nonamyloidogenic APP cleavage.



Figure 4 :
Figure 4: Interconnected signaling pathways of BDNF, sAPPα and Αβ in balancing neuroplasticity or excitotoxicity.
sAPPα and BDNF can modulate several pathways involved in neuroplasticity processes like neurite outgrowth, synaptic integrity, and neuroprotection including the PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and MAPK/Erk/Egr1 signaling.
sAPPα activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway depends on the presence of full length APP and its intracellular G-protein interaction motif or might be induced via sAPPα binding to an unknown receptor.
sAPPα also reduces tau-pathology by inhibiting GSK3β activity via the PI3/Akt pathway.
In the case of BDNF, neuronal survival is also mediated along the PI3K/Akt pathway.
In addition, BDNF-induced activation of NF-κB promotes survival as well as neurite outgrowth.
Convergence of BDNF and sAPPα signaling might protect from age-related changes in NF-κB function.
Binding of BDNF dimer to the TrkB receptor also activates the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway as well as nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERK thereby promoting survival, spine integrity and LTP.
Phosphorylation of the TrkB receptor activates the PLC-γ pathway, generating inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
The PLC-γ/IP3 pathway results in calcium release from intracellular stores, which in turn activates Ca 2+ /CaMKII.
CaMKII can in turn induce the expression of Egr1.
TrkB receptor also promotes α-secretase cleavage of APP by activating ADAM10.
In contrast, Aβ oligomers induce NMDA receptor-dependent inward calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) currents, membrane depolarization, oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death.
Aβ coupled excitotoxicity also stimulates TrkB cleavage by calpain in a calcium dependent manner.
Furthermore, Aβ-induced deficits in BDNF transport were described to be mediated by activation of GSK-3β.
The following abbreviations are used: PI3K (phosphoinositide 3 kinase), Akt/protein kinase b (AK strain transforming), GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), RAS (rat sarcoma), MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase), ERK (extracellular signal related kinase), EGR1 (Early growth response 1), PLC-γ (phospholipase C-γ), PK1, CaMKII (Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II), Gαβγ (trimeric G protein), NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor), TrkB (Tropomyosin receptor kinase B).



Figure 5 :
Figure 5: Protein-protein interactions of the different receptors on the cell surface.
Interactions of the different receptors have been demonstrated.
TrkB receptor is known to form homodimers, but also heterodimerization of TrkB with p75, APP, sorLA and sortilin, respectively, have been reported.
Intracellular TrkB catalytic domain as well as intracellular domain of APP are important for interactions of TrkB and APP at cell surface.
These interactions are independent on the presence of BDNF.
Interactions of sortilin and TrkB are responsible for anterograde transport of the receptor, while sorLA binds to TrkB at the cell surface and promotes internalization of the activated TrkB.
Interaction of TrkB and p75 is suggested to require BDNF-induced TrkB activation followed by dynamin-mediated endocytosis.For APP, homodimerization as well as heterodimerization with p75, TrkB, sorLA and sortilin is known.
Interaction of p75 and APP are reduced in the presence of neurotrophins and Aβ, respectively, indicating competing binding sites for the respective ligands.
APP interacts further with sorLA and sortilin, respectively, via the intracellular region as well as via the ectodomain.
In addition, the neurotrophin receptor p75 interacts with its coreceptor sortilin.
Homodimerization of p75 and sortilin, respectively, has also been demonstrated.
Only for sorLA, homodimerization could not be demonstrated.
While sorLA seems to be predominantly located in cholesterol-and sphingomyelin rich lipid raft domains (membrane stained in rose), sortilin is more efficiently sorted to nonrafts domains (membrane stained in grey).
TrkB translocates from non-raft to lipid raft domains after BDNF-binding.
Recruitment of p75 to lipid rafts seems to be also dependent on ligand binding.
In general, however, localization of the mentioned receptors to lipid raft or non-raft regions is not well understood.
Distribution of p75/sortilin heterodimers or TrkB/sortilin heterodimer can only be speculated due to the predominant localization of sortilin to non-rafts.
