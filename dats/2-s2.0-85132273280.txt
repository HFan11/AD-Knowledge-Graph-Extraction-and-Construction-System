Functional and Phenotypic Diversity of Microglia: Implication for Microglia-Based Therapies for Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is closely associated with the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).
Apart from Aβ and NFT pathologies, AD patients also exhibit a widespread microglial activation in various brain regions with elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a phenomenon known as neuroinflammation.
In healthy central nervous system, microglia adopt ramified, "surveying" phenotype with compact cell bodies and elongated processes.
In AD, the presence of pathogenic proteins such as extracellular Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau, induce the transformation of ramified microglia into amoeboid microglia.
Ameboid microglia are highly phagocytic immune cells and actively secrete a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
However, the phagocytic ability of microglia gradually declines with age, and thus the clearance of pathogenic proteins becomes highly ineffective, leading to the accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the aging brain.
The accumulation of pathogenic proteins further augments the neuroinflammatory responses and sustains the activation of microglia.
The excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induces a massive loss of functional synapses and neurons, further worsening the disease condition of AD.
More recently, the identification of a subset of microglia by transcriptomic studies, namely disease-associated microglia (DAM), the progressive transition from homeostatic microglia to DAM is TREM2-dependent and the homeostatic microglia gradually acquire the state of DAM during the disease progression of AD.
Recent in-depth transcriptomic analysis identifies ApoE and Trem2 from microglia as the major risk factors for AD pathogenesis.
In this review, we summarize current understandings of the functional roles of age-dependent microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD.
To this end, the exponential growth in transcriptomic data provides a solid foundation for in silico drug screening and gains further insight into the development of microglia-based therapeutic interventions for AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the common cause of dementia, which accounts for an estimated 60-70% of all dementia cases throughout the globe
In the United States, an estimated 11.3% of people aged 65 or older are affected by AD-associated dementia.
The relative prevalence of AD increased from age 65-74 (5.3%) to ≥85 years (34.6%)
(Alzheimer's Association, 2019).
There are approximately 55 million people living with AD or other forms of dementia worldwide, which is expected to increase from 78 million in 2030 to nearly 139 million by 2050
Currently, five pharmacologic treatments for AD are available to improve cognitive function in patients although the improvement is not maintained in the long term
However, none of the drugs has been shown to be effectively delayed disease progression and prevented further neuronal damage in the brain.
The socioeconomic impact of AD is enormous and the cost of healthcare is estimated to be US$ 1.3 trillion.
In the absence of preventive measures and effective treatments for AD, medical cost is believed to exceed US$ 2.8 trillion by 2030
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions that can halt the disease progression, especially at the early stage of AD.
It is generally accepted that the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) caused by Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively, are the primary events that lead to progressive loss of cognitive function in AD patients
However, there is compelling clinical evidence suggesting that elevated inflammatory responses might appear much earlier than the deposition of Aβ plaques and abnormal NFTs, which play vital roles in the pathogenesis of AD
For instance, elevated levels of inflammatory proteins, α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were found in the blood plasma of AD patients before clinical onset of dementia
In another study, an elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP), a non-specific marker for inflammation, was found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
Similarly, a total of 18 inflammatory proteins were shown to be dysregulated in the blood plasma of pre-symptomatic AD patients
Growing evidence suggests that Aβ deposition and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins induced activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18.
Aβ-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome led to the formation of apoptosisassociated spec-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) proteins, resulting in augmented neuroinflammatory responses
Recent advances in RNA-sequencing technologies allow in-depth transcriptomic analysis at single-cell resolution, which identified a subset of microglia, namely disease-associated microglia (DAM)
In response to Aβ deposition, the resident microglia gradually lost the homeostatic microglia gene signature, and became highly proliferative
The progressive transition from homeostatic microglia to DAM is TREM2-dependent
The presence of DAM also induced reactive astrocytes to adopt a neurotoxic A1 phenotype via the activation of classical complement cascades
In this Review, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the role of age-dependent microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of AD, and provide new insight into the development of microglia-based therapeutic interventions for AD.

MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION AND NEUROINFLAMMATION IN THE AGING BRAIN
Neuroinflammation is defined as a cascade of inflammatory responses within the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in sustained production of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other secondary messengers by resident microglia
Microglia are morphologically diverse innate immune cells that are originated from primitive myeloid precursors in the embryonic yolk sac
As an important player for maintaining homeostasis within the CNS throughout the lifetime, microglia are involved in multiple vital cellular processes including immune surveillance, antigen presentation, debris clearance, neuronal apoptosis, maintenance of synaptic activity, and production of cytokine, chemokine and neurotrophic factors
Impaired microglial function is often associated with various neurodegenerative diseases such as AD
Microglia are highly dynamic immune cells in which they undergo constant changes in morphology in response to the changing microenvironment.
Under normal physiological condition, microglia display ramified phenotype with extended branches and processes.
Ramified microglia are highly motile which allow them to detect any subtle changes in the microenvironment by extension and retraction of microglial processes
In the presence of endogenous or exogenous insults (mechanical lesion, pathogen, cellular debris, and misfolded protein) that prompt the transformation of ramified "resting" microglia into amoeboid "activated" microglia with thicken and retracted processes, and actively migrate toward the pathological insults
Ameboid microglia contribute to the removal and degradation of pathological insults by phagocytosis, endocytosis, and secretion of various inflammatory mediators
In general, the inflammatory response is gradually resolved once the pathological insult is removed from the CNS.
However, the persistent of DNA damages, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, waste production, and other cellular damages in the CNS microenvironment overtime during aging, microglia became "primed" with exaggerated and heightened microglial responses even toward a minor pathological insult
In aged mammalian brains, there is an increased number of amoeboid-like microglia with enlarged cell bodies and shorten processes
Similarly, microglia also displayed enlarged cell bodies with fewer and shorten processes in aged human brains
Growing evidence suggests that primed microglia induced substantial changes in morphology and inflammatory profiles during the entire course of aging.
Aged microglia first showed a significant reduction of homeostatic microglial-specific gene expression such as P2yr12
Moreover, aged microglia showed increased expression of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), surface marker proteins (CD11b, CD68, and CD86) and various Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
However, the neuroprotective nature of primed microglia gradually lost over time with increased production of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), ROS and nitric oxide (NO)
More importantly, aged primed microglia were more likely to amplify pro-inflammatory responses induced by TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-1β, which further stimulated expansion of primed microglia in the aged brain
Aged microglia also displayed a defective phagocytotic capacity toward Aβ aggregates
The ability of aged microglia to migrate toward an extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a signaling molecule released by injured neurons, or a laser-induced focal injury was significantly dampened
Young microglia returned to the "resting" state within days after focal injury, while aged microglia exhibited persistent microglial activation at the site of injury even weeks after focal injury
In addition, genes associated with onset of AD such as Cxcl10
To this end, prolonged microglial activation and microglial priming during aging often led to overproduction of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines results in substantial neuronal damage and cognitive functional impairment in the aged brain, which usually precedes Aβ aggregation and tau pathology

MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
A long-held hypothesis posits that gradual cognitive function decline in both AD and MCI patients is, at least in part, due to the deposition of Aβ plaques in various brain regions
Aβ is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via cleavage by βand γ-secretases
Cleavage and processing of APP proteins are classified into two distinct pathways.
Non-amyloidogenic pathways produce beneficial and soluble APP fragment (sAPP-α) via cleavage by αsecretase, which involves in the modulation of synaptic plasticity as shown in cultured hippocampal neurons
Cleavage of APP by α-secretase did not generate Aβ and thus prevented the formation of Aβ plaques
Amyloidogenic pathways produce APP proteins via cleavage by β-secretase (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1; BACE1) and γ-secretase complex which is composed of presenilin-1 (PS-1), presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), nicastrin, and APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1)
Cleavage of APP by β-secretase and γsecretase complex generated two main forms of Aβ peptides, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42.
These Aβ monomer started to aggregate, leading to the formation of neurotoxic soluble Aβ oligomers, and further assembled to form insoluble Aβ fibrils and plaques
However, the precise mechanisms underlying the formation of Aβ plaques remains unclear.
A recent study has demonstrated that increasing cholesterol level in astrocytes facilitated the transfer of cholesterol to neighboring neurons via apolipoprotein E (ApoE), resulting in increased Aβ production and plaque formation
Although deposition of extracellular Aβ plaques is often described as the pathogenic hallmark in AD, emerging evidence suggests that accumulation of intracellular Aβ also exhibited significant neurotoxicity to CNS neurons
In various mouse models of AD, intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ often preceded the deposition of extracellular Aβ plaques and subsequent cognitive functional impairment
In the initial stage of AD, Aβ aggregation started to appear within the neuronal cell bodies of large pyramidal neurons and hippocampal neurons
With the increasing loads of intraneuronal Aβ, it leads to the death of the affected neurons and release of Aβ to the extracellular space
These results agreed well with human study that intracellular Aβ accumulation precede Aβ plaque deposition
Indeed, a fraction of neurons showed a redistribution of extracellular Aβ plaques into the cell bodies via the interaction between Aβ, ApoE and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)
During normal aging, the increased DNA damage and oxidative stress, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins, dead cells and other waste products, induced activation of microglia leading to the down-regulation of homeostatic microglia marker gene expressions.
Also, these activated "primed" microglia expressed high levels of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), surface marker proteins (CD11b, CD68, and CD86) and various Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
These primed microglia often displayed defective phagocytic capacity and decreased motility toward chemoattractants.
The elevated production of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines lost their neuroprotection to support neurons.

axonal swelling
These results are consistent with the pathological studies that increased Aβ-42 oligomer is associated with cognitive deficit in AD patients
Another pathogenic hallmark of AD is the aggregation of NFTs which consist mainly of the hyperphosphorylated tau proteins
Tau is a neuronal-specific microtubule-associated protein which play a pivotal role in maintaining the stability of axonal microtubules, and its activity is tightly orchestrated by tau phosphorylation
Since tau-microtubule binding domain is involved in tau-tau interaction, self-aggregation of tau is largely prevented once tau protein is bound tightly with microtubule
However, once tau protein is abnormally hyperphosphorylated under pathogenic conditions and lose its biological activity of microtubule binding.
Tau protein detached from microtubule and form aggregates
These abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau proteins gradually accumulated in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons and formed NFT aggregates in the brain of AD patients
Abnormally hyperphosphorylation of tau protein lost its ability to promote microtubule assembly
The accumulation of NFTs first appeared in entorhinal cortex, which gradually propagated to pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 regions, and finally spread to hippocampus
Interestingly, a recent study confirmed that the pathological tau proteins can be transported from one neuron to another through axonal terminals, suggesting that these dysregulated proteins can be axonally transported via active intra-axonal transport throughout the brain
In addition, the extracellular insoluble tau aggregates could induce the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the cytosol of adjacent neurons, leading to the formation of NFTs
A recent study suggested that the increased accumulation of NFTs in the brain is strongly associated with reduced grey matter volumes and progressive cognitive decline in AD patients
Increased microglial activation alongside the formation of Aβ plaques and NFTs has been observed in the early stage of AD pathogenesis.
Microglia are the first respondent to toxic stimuli that play key roles in maintaining proper synaptic plasticity and circuit integrity
Microglia are traditionally believed to adopt two distinctive microglial phenotypes, namely, the M1 (neurotoxic) and M2 (neuroprotective) subtypes
M1 microglia, activated by IFN-γ, TNF-α, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), express proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, ROS and nitric oxide (NO).
M1 microglia also express NADPH oxidase and high levels of MHC class II that are closely related to increased inflammatory response and neurotoxicity
On the other hands, IL-4 and IL-13 induce a M2 microglial phenotype, which is characterized by the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGFβ), neurotrophic factors (IGF-1) and increased expression of inflammatory mediators that promote phagocytosis of cellular debris and misfolded proteins, neuronal survival, tissue repair and wound healing processes (Ym1, FIZZ1, and Arg-1)
At the early stage of AD, activated microglia were able to clear Aβ by phagocytosis
However, as disease progressed, the increased levels of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines switched the microglial phenotype from M2 to M1 phenotype with impaired microglial phagocytosis of Aβ plaques
Post-mortem brain tissues in patients at the early stage of AD revealed that an elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in activated microglia located in close proximity to senile Aβ plaques
An increased level of TNF-α were also detected in the blood sera of AD patients
In cultured microglia derived from AD patients, exposure to Aβ induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3), and NO
Therefore M2-to-M1 microglial phenotype switch might contribute to the gradual increase in Aβ plaques and massive neuronal loss at the advanced stages of AD
Despite the fact that the elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia is thought to be linked to the exacerbated AD pathologies; however, recent studies demonstrate that overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines attenuated the deposition of Aβ.
For instance, overexpression of IFN-γ led to a widespread activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, thereby elevating the production of another pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and the activation of complement system.
The IFN-γoverexpressing microglia displayed an enhanced phagocytosis which led to a massive reduction in Aβ deposition in a mouse model of AD
Similarly, overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 induced a widespread activation of microglia and astrocytes with enhanced phagocytic capability, resulting in effective clearance of Aβ plaques in the hippocampus of AD mice
On the other hand, overexpression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 significantly impaired the phagocytosis of soluble Aβ oligomers by microglia, and increased Aβ deposition in the hippocampus leading to the impairment of cognitive functions in AD mice
Further investigations are required to carefully examine the role of these inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of AD and therapeutic potential for AD.
Several cell surface receptors in microglia including TLRs, scavenger receptor SCARA1, CD14, CD36, CD47, and α6β1 integrin
CREB in turn activated the transcription of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
Recent studies have demonstrated that the activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a fundamental event for Aβ-induced inflammatory responses
The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that contains a sensor protein NLRP3, an adaptor protein PYCARD (also known as apoptosis-associated spec-like protein containing a CARD; ASC) and an effector protein caspase-1
NLRP3 protein consists of three major domains: a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a central NACHT domain, and an amino-terminal pyrin (PYR) domain
CD36 acts together with TLR4-TLR6 heterodimers to recognize both soluble and fibrillar Aβ
Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1, which in turn promotes the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to active pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18
These studies are consistence with report of substantially increased amount of cleaved caspase-1 in brains from AD patients
Interestingly, genetic ablation of NLRP3 or Caspase-1 significantly reduced Aβ deposition in APP/PS-1 mouse model of AD which was largely due to the enhanced phagocytic capacity in NLRP3-/Caspase-1-deficient microglia to actively engulfing Aβ plaques.
NLRP3/Caspase-1-deficient microglia also displayed elevated productions of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-4, Arg-1, and FIZZ-1, and reduced expression of NOS2.
As a result, APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse with NLRP3-/Caspase-1deficiency exhibited a significant improvement in spatial memory function
After NLRP3 inflammasome activation, adaptor protein ASC bridges the sensor protein NLRP3 via PYD domain, leading to the formation of ASC fibrils
ASC fibrils then recruit the effector protein caspase-1 via its CARD domain for caspase activation, which leads to the formation of speck-like aggregates of ASC proteins
Once the ASC speck-like aggregates are formed, they are released into the extracellular space and taken up by adjacent myeloid cells such as microglia to further propagate and amplify inflammatory responses
ASC speck-like aggregates are found within the activated microglia and the extracellular space in the hippocampus of AD patients and APP/PS-1 mouse model of AD.
Exposure to soluble Aβ stimulated the production and release of ASC speck-like aggregates in cultured primary mouse microglia
Extracellular ASC speck-like aggregates bind to the surrounding soluble Aβ and promote the formation of Aβ aggregates in APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse.
Intrahippocampal injections of recombinant ASC specklike aggregates into the APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse facilitated the propagation of Aβ deposition.
Genetic deletion of ASC or by administration of neutralizing antibodies against ASC proteins significantly reduced the deposition of Aβ and improved cognitive functions in APP/PS-1 transgenic mice
A recent study also confirmed that NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to the development of tau pathology
Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome (as reflected by the increased level of cleaved caspase-1) and ASC speck-like aggregates were found in the hippocampus of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
Genetic ablation of NLRP3 markedly inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and rescued spatial memory impairment in Tau22 mice.
More importantly, intracerebral injection of Aβcontaining brain homogenate into Tau22 mice exaggerated tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus, which was completely prevented when NLRP3 was deleted from Tau22 mice
A recent indepth transcriptomic analysis confirmed that Aβ deposition and microglial activation concurrently drive pathogenic tau spread in different brain regions in AD patients
Taken together, these studies highlight the potential of pharmacological targeting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome as an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.

DISEASE-ASSOCIATED MICROGLIA AND ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
The classic M1-M2 dichotomy has been used traditionally to describe the microglial activation states when purified microglial cells are exposed to stimuli in cultures.
However, M1-M2 phenotypic states might not emerge as isolated pure phenomena in animal studies, suggesting the need to reconsider the rather simplified M1-M2 phenotypic switching concept
In the past decade, transcriptomic analysis at singlecell resolution identified functionally and phenotypic distinct microglial subtypes that closely associate with the pathogenesis of AD, namely the disease-associated microglia (DAM)
Homeostatic microglia gradually acquire the state of DAM during the disease progression of AD
A recent study utilized a well-established mouse model of AD that expressed five human familial AD gene mutations (5xFAD) to examine the temporal transcriptomic changes at single-cell resolution
The Aβ deposition reported in 5xFAD mouse model starting at 1.5 months with profound Aβ deposition in the cortical and hippocampal regions at around 2 months
Two DAM subtypes with distinct transcriptomic profiles were identified during the disease progression of AD in 5xFAD mice
Before the disease onset, homeostatic microglia expressed high levels of microglia-specific marker genes including P2ry12, Cx3cr1, and Tmem119
Transition from homeostatic to DAM state seems to be a two-step process (stage 1 and 2) in which homeostatic microglia first transition to an intermediate stage (stage 1 DAM) in a TREM2-independent manner, followed by a TREM2-dependent transition to stage 2 DAM (Figure
The upregulated genes in stage 1 DAM, including AD-associated genes such as Tyrobp and Apoe, which occurs during the early stages of disease.
Stage 2 DAM usually appear in the advanced stage of AD characterized by the upregulation of Cst7, Lpl, and Trem2.
These DAMs not only increase gene expression responsible for inflammatory responses, but also genes for phagocytosis and endocytosis.
In both 5xFAD mice and post-mortem human AD brains, a significant subpopulation of DAM was localized in close proximity to the Aβ aggregates which enabled active internalization of Aβ aggregates
By single-nucleus RNA (snRNA) sequencing, a comprehensive transcriptional analysis on Trem2-deficient 5xFAD mice and AD patients who carried the TREM2 variants was performed.
The presence of TREM2-dependent DAM was confirmed in patients with AD carrying the TREM2 variant.
Genetic deletion of Trem2 markedly reduced the microglial density in 5xFAD mice, and reduced the expression of DAM signature genes, suggesting that Aβ-pathology-induced microglial expansion is partially TREM2-dependent
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from homeostatic microglia to DAMs remains elusive that requires further investigation.
Similarly, two distinct phenotypes (early and late phases) of microglia were identified during the disease progression of AD using an inducible transgenic mouse line of p25
At the early stage of AD (i.e., 1 week after p25 induction) when intraneuronal Aβ deposition was absent
After initial stage of microglial proliferation in response to neurodegeneration events, microglia switch from the early-responding phenotype to a late-responding phenotype with upregulation of immune response-related genes (i.e., 2-6 weeks after p25 induction)
These late-responding microglia expressed subsets of genes encoded for MHC class I and II components, interferon-responding genes, and various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
Also, they elevated the expression of many marker genes for both stage 1 and 2 DAMs, suggesting a substantial overlap of gene expression profiles between DAMs and late-responding microglia.
Interestingly, most genes that expressed exclusively in early-responding microglia showed little overlap with those genes expressed in stage 1 and 2 DAMs, indicating that the earlyresponding microglia appear to precede the activation of DAMs
A subsequent study further confirmed that the activation of TREM2-APOE signaling pathways in DAM is essential for the switch of homeostatic microglia to DAMs during the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases including AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS)
The apoptotic neurons act as the driving force for the activation of DAM.
The homeostatic microglia rapidly migrated toward the apoptotic neurons, transformed into amoeboid-like DAMs and to actively engulfing the apoptotic neurons with elevated expression of Apoe.
The upregulation of Apoe in DAMs suppresses the major transcription factors of homeostatic microglia (Mef2a, Mafb, and Smad3) and TGF-β-mediated anti-inflammation.
Genetic In healthy individuals, microglia usually adopt a ramified morphology and expressed a diverse variety of marker genes for homeostatic microglia.
In the early pathogenesis of AD that preceded the deposition of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the homeostatic microglia transformed into a highly proliferative state and elevated the production of various chemokines and other inflammatory genes.
When Aβ plaque loads gradually increased, some of the microglia down-regulated the expression of the homeostatic microglial marker genes, transformed into stage 1 DAM with elevated expression of Tyrobp and Apoe via TREM2-independent pathways, and started colonizing near the Aβ plaques.
With the increase in Aβ and NFT deposition, the stage 1 DAM slowly transformed into fully activated stage 2 DAM via TREM2-dependent pathways.
These stage 2 DAM were highly phagocytic and involved in the active internalization of Aβ plaques via activation of genes involved in phagocytosis and lipid metabolisms.

ablation of Apoe or its upstream regulator Trem2 restored homeostatic microglia gene signature (i.e., P2ry12, Gpr34, Tmem119, Tgfbr1, and Csf1r), while the genes essential for the DAM phenotypic transformation were suppressed (Trem2, Axl, Clec7a, Csf1, Itgax, Cd34, and Apoe)
Apoe-deleted homeostatic microglia displayed an effective phagocytic response to engulf and degrade Aβ plaques in a mouse model of AD coexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS-1)
Interestingly, the elevated expression of Apoe was negatively correlated with the loss of homeostatic microglia gene signature as shown in various mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases (two AD mouse models and one ALS mouse model), and in post-mortem brains from AD patients
An exhaustive gene expression profiling study on a widely used mouse model of AD that expressed mouse APP with three AD-associated mutations (Swedish mutations in exon 16, and Beyreuther/Iberian and Arctic mutations in exon 17)
The authors uncovered a major population of reactive microglia, namely activated response microglia (ARMs), which displayed multifunctional gene response and is part of the normal evolution of microglia during the aging process.
The presence of amyloid plaques in APP mice accelerated the switching of homeostatic microglia to ARMs.
One of the known AD risk genes such as Apoe, were highly upregulated in ARMs cells.
Genetic deletion of ApoE significantly reduced the number of microglia expressing ARMs signature genes, suggesting that the strong association of AD genetic risk factors, and the activation and function of ARMs
It suggests that ApoE dysregulation plays a key role in the transition of homeostatic microglia to DAM in neurodegenerative diseases.
More recently, it has been suggested that a specific subtype of microglia termed "human Alzheimer's microglia (HAM)" was identified in post-mortem human brain and highly relevant for the pathogenesis of AD
In total, 66 genes (45 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated) were differentially expressed in microglia within the superior frontal gyrus (a region for visuospatial cognitive functional impairment) of AD patients.
Interestingly, a large number of genes that were upregulated in HAM overlapped significantly with genes upregulated in aged human cortical microglia
Several upregulated genes in the HAM including APOE, LSR (lipolysisstimulated lipoprotein receptor) and ARSA (lysosomal enzyme), which are associated with lipid and lysosomal signaling pathways
In addition, two distinct microglia subclusters were identified in post-mortem human brains that were strongly associated with either Aβ plaques (i.e., AD1microglia) or hyperphosphorylated tau (i.e., AD2-microglia) by snRNA sequencing.
In AD1-microglia, APOE and TREM2 were significantly up-regulated.
Notably, of the 63 AD genetic risk factors, 15 were highly upregulated (i.e., TREM2 and APOE) in AD1-microglia, while only six genes were found to have moderate changes in gene expression in AD2-microglia, suggesting the genetic risk of AD is primarily associated with Aβ plaques pathology (AD1-microglia), but not with phosphotau pathology (AD2-microglia)
Increasing evidence suggests that APOE is the major genetic risk factor of late onset and sporadic AD, which accounts for 95% of total AD cases
In mice, a number of DAM signature genes including Apoe, Ch25h, Lpl, Ctsb, and Atp6v0d2 were highly upregulated and involved in the lipid metabolism
Taken together, transcriptomic studies in both AD patients and mouse models of AD highlight the pivotal role of microglia in lipid metabolism during disease progression
Therapeutic interventions targeting TREM2-APOE-mediated lipid metabolism could switch the HAM or DAMs to homeostatic microglia and to halt AD progression
Apart from DAM, a spatially resolved transcriptomics study reveals that A1 astrocytes are the major driver for AD progression in response to Aβ deposition
In APP mice, which exhibited substantial activation of microglia and astrocytes, as well as Aβ deposition in both cortical and hippocampal areas
A subset of plaqueinduced genes (PIGs) was gradually increased in both DAMs (Apoe, Trem2, Tyrobp, Cstd, and Lyz2) and A1 astrocytes (Gfap, B2m, and C4b) accompanied by an increase in Aβ accumulation across different brain regions
Temporally, increased Aβ deposition in the early onset of AD first triggered the activation of microglia which expressed high levels of DAM signature genes (i.e., C1qa and C1qb)
The elevated expression of C1qa and C1qb, and the activation of classical complement system in DAMs surrounding the Aβ plaques induced astrocytes to adopt neurotoxic A1 phenotype
A subsequent co-expression network analysis of PIGs revealed that DAM signature genes (Trem2 and Tyrobp) had the strongest connection to the A1 astrocytes signature genes (Cstd, B2m, and Apoe)
These studies further support the notion that intercellular crosstalk between DAM and A1 astrocytes is crucial for AD progression
A1 astrocytes have been shown to be highly neurotoxic that led to a substantial neuronal and synaptic loss in cultured CNS neurons
Pharmaceutical blockade of the classical complement cascade activated in DAM might prevent the A1 astrocyte phenotypic switch that could foster neuroprotection
A1 astrocytes were found in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex of AD patients
In another study, a subset of reactive astrocytes, namely disease-associated astrocytes (DAAs), is identified in which the expression profile of DAA is largely overlapped with A1 astrocytes.
The abundance of DAAs substantially expanded (up to 40% among the total astrocyte population) during the AD progression in 5xFAD mice
Interestingly, the population of DAA also underwent gradual expansion in aged mice, as well as in post-mortem brains from aged human
This is consistent with other study that astrocytes gradually adopted an A1-like astrocytic phenotype during normal aging
Recent advances in transcriptomic analysis on microglial populations from AD patients and various AD mouse models have revolutionized our understanding on the roles of microglia in the pathogenesis of AD.
A general observation from the above transcriptomic studies is that resident microglia gradually lost their gene signatures during aging and AD progression.
Although the functions of these microglia signature genes are yet to be determined, it is believed that they are involved in the CNS-specialized functions which separate microglia from other blood-borne myeloid cells.
Loss of the microglia gene signature might affect cellular homeostasis in the CNS during normal aging and AD progression
TREM2-mediated signaling pathways regulate transition from homeostatic microglia to DAM
Although major controversy regarding the TREM2-dependent DAM activation in fostering neuroprotection in AD still remains.
Genetic deletion of TREM2 impaired the transition from intermediate state DAM to DAM with enhanced phagocytic capacity
Further study revealed that AD Mice with TREM2 haplodeficiency or TREM2-deletion led to the formation of more diffused Aβ plaques, which increased the area of contact between Aβ plaques and adjacent neurons resulting in exaggerated axonal damages in the surrounding tissues
In contrast, TREM2 is required for the compaction of Aβ into dense plaques by microglia that limits Aβ plaque diffusion and exposure to minimize amyloid-related neuronal damage
In 5xFAD mice, overexpression of TREM2 markedly promoted the phagocytic capacity of resident microglia and reduced Aβ deposition.
TREM2 overexpression inhibited the activation of classical complement cascade significantly in 5xFAD mice as well as attenuating A1 astrocyte-induced inflammatory responses.
In addition, TREM2 overexpression upregulated genes that involved in microglial phagocytosis (Lgals3), anti-inflammatory responses (Postn), and microglial survival (Spp1) in 5xFAD mice
The production of neuroprotective anti-inflammatory cytokines (arginase-1, IL-10, and Ym1) was elevated and the production of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) was reduced by TREM2 overexpression.
In a recent study, it has been shown that TREM2 could be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD since TREM2 overexpression rescued cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting microglia-mediated neuroinflammation
Interestingly, there was very little overlap between DAM gene signatures identified from different mouse models of AD and HAM gene signatures from human AD patients
One possible explanation is that most of the AD mouse models overexpress one or multiple gene mutations for familial AD, which accounts for only 5% of AD patients worldwide
The microglial responses to familial AD mutations might be different in sporadic AD.
Another possible explanation could be that the mechanisms underlying inflammatory responses to microglial activation in mouse models of AD and AD patients are very different indeed.
We should note that AD is clinically heterogeneous in disease progression that might also account for the discrepancy between DAM and HAM gene signatures across studies
For instance, a meta-analysis comparing microglial expression profiles from various animal models of AD, including mouse models that overexpressed familial AD mutations (5xFAD and APP/PS1 mice) and mouse models of tau pathology, revealed elevated expression of core neurodegeneration-related genes across the various mouse models.
The core of neurodegenerationrelated genes included DAM signature genes such as Apoe, Itgax, Hif1a, Ctsb, Ctsl, and Ctsz, as well as genes that regulated lysosomal activities
Nevertheless, these transcriptomic studies all propose the key roles of ApoE in the pathogenesis of AD, which required further investigation regarding its functions in regulating the microglial activation state.
Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that genetic ablation of ApoE in microglia did not affect the microglial transcriptional shift to a DAM state; however, deletion of ApoE in microglia slightly increased Aβ deposition and reduced the number of pre-and post-synaptic vesicles in hippocampus of 5xFAD mice
It therefore suggests that microglial-specific ApoE expression could be necessary for effective clearance of Aβ plaques and maintenance of functional synapses in AD.

TREM2-DAP12 SIGNALING PATHWAY IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
TREM2 is an immunoglobin superfamily receptor present on myeloid cells such as dendritic cells, osteoclasts, macrophages and microglia
DAP12 is one of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing polypeptides.
ITAMs were first identified in the immune system, where they play key roles in cellular response including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation proliferation and phagocytosis
Once DAP12 binds to TREM2, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase named Src phosphorylates the ITAM of DAP12, leading to recruitment and activation of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of another protein tyrosine kinase named spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)
The ITAM-mediated activation of microglial phagocytic processes is counter-regulated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) signaling molecules such as sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamily lectins (Siglecs)
Several ITAM and ITIM-containing proteins are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, including DAP12, SYK and CD33
TREM2-DAP12 complex played an indispensable role in mediating the microglial phagocytic processes and cytokine production
In mouse models of AD, overexpression of DAP12 in microglia reduced the Aβ deposition and elevated the level of phosphorylated Tau in the cerebral cortices.
Interestingly, overexpression of DAP12 induced up-regulation of other DAM genes such as Apoe, Itgax, Axl and Tgf-β in the mouse model of AD, suggesting that DAP12 is essential for DAM phenotypic transformation
In cultured primary microglia and AD patients, exposure to soluble Aβ peptides/plaques induced the formation of large and persistent stress granules within microglia.
SYK proteins were recruited to these stress granules and thereby led to the impairment of microglial phagocytosis and augmented ROS production.
Pharmaceutical blockade of SYK protein suppressed the formation of stress granules and attenuated ROS production but failed to restore the microglial phagocytic capacity
Interestingly, recent studies showed that selective blockade of SYK proteins markedly decreased Aβ deposition and suppressed the hyperphosphorylation of Tau across different mouse models of AD
CD33 is an ITIM-containing protein that is linked to the late-onset AD in human
A genetic variant of CD33 gene (rs24162737) is associated with the increased risk factor of AD
In cultured microglia, overexpression of CD33 largely reduced the uptake of insoluble Aβ, which might positively correlate with the increased Aβ deposition with elevated immunoreactivity of microglial CD33 in AD patients
Genetic deletion of CD33 markedly enhanced the microglial phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates in vitro
Clec7a (also known as Dectin-1) is a transmembrane non-TLR pattern-recognition receptor that signal via a ITAM-like motif in its cytoplasmic tail and induces microglial activation via activation of Src and Syk family kinases
In developing mouse brain, a large population of Clec7a-positive microglia was found in corpus callosum and cerebellar white matter.
Clec7a-positive microglia were mostly amoeboid in shape and showed a higher phagocytic capacity than the Clec7a-negative microglia
In AD mice, Clec7a was up-regulated in a TREM2-and APOE-dependent manner
The Clec7a-positive microglia were found adjacent to Aβ plaques

BIPOLAR/ROD-SHAPED MICROGLIA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Over the past decades, much effort has been attributed to characterize ramified (resting) and amoeboid (activated) microglia in various neurological disorders that might be an oversimplification.
Apart from the classical subdivision of microglia into ramified and amoeboid microglia, bipolar/rodshaped microglia also appeared in the brains under several pathological conditions
In fact, bipolar/rod-shaped microglia was the first form of activated microglia characterized by Nissl in 1899
This form of microglia were "strung-out, " with extremely slim cell bodies and indefinitely long processes
Subsequent studies also found that bipolar/rodshaped microglia were present in cerebral cortices of patients with paralytic dementia, typhus or syphilis infections, and sleeping disorders
However, the functional role of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia remains largely unexplored until recently.
In an experimental model of traumatic brain injury using a midline fluid percussion injury, ramified microglia quickly transformed into bipolar/rod-shaped microglia and formed end-to-end alignment in close proximity with injured axons at the primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) region of rat cerebral cortex at days 1-7 post-injury
These trains of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia also displayed a high phagocytic capacity with elevated expression of CD68
The presence of trains of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia was found in other neurological disorders such as traumatic optic neuropathy, Huntington's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and ischemic strokes, and their possible functional roles have been discussed extensively by us and others
This article will therefore review recent advances regarding the roles of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia in AD pathology.
A series of reports highlighted the presence of microglia with highly polarized rod-like morphology in the cerebral cortices, and CA1 and CA2/3 regions of hippocampus during the pathogenesis of AD
These bipolar/rod-shaped microglia are highly proliferative (strong immunoreactivity against a cell proliferation marker PCNA) and colonized in close proximity with senile plaques
They also formed end-to-end alignment along with degenerating axons with high immunoreactivity against PHF1 (a marker for NFTs)
Interestingly, bipolar/rod-shaped microglia in various subcortical regions of AD brains displayed high immunoreactivity against tau protein, suggesting that they might be involved in the internalization of NFTs or degenerating neurons with high loads of hyperphosphorylated tau
Similarly, bipolar/rod-shaped microglia were also found in aged chimpanzees with AD-like pathology
Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that the occurrence of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia in cerebral cortex and hippocampus increased with age.
The increase in numbers of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia occurred in parietal cortex, but not in hippocampus and temporal cortex in AD-related pathology
Due to the unique spatial arrangement of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia with damaged axons, it is plausible that bipolar/rod-shaped microglia could exert its neuroprotective action for damaged axons as well as tissue repairing in AD
Ramified and amoeboid microglia can be easily enriched by culturing them onto a fibronectin-coated and laminin-coated surface, respectively
However, there is a lack of in vitro culture system to enrich bipolar/rodshaped microglia for molecular or cellular studies in response to cytokines, chemokines, chemoattractant and so forth.
We recently established a cost-effective and highly reproducible cell culture system to enrich bipolar/rod-shaped microglia
Primary microglia purified from postnatal mice cerebral cortices were plated onto a scratched surface pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin, and trains of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia formed stable end-toend alignment on the laminin-free scratched surface
These bipolar/rod-shaped microglia were highly proliferative and expressed a decreased levels of M1 (IL-1β, TNF-α, CD32, and CD86) and M2 (TGF-β and IL-10)
In contrast, the microglia colonized in the laminin-rich surface adopted an amoeboid morphology actively digested the laminin surface via elevated expression of two laminin-cleaving proteins ADAM9 and CTSS
Upon LPS stimulation, bipolar/rod-shaped microglia quickly transformed to amoeboid microglia with increased expression of M1 markers (IL-1β and TNF-α) and laminin-cleaving proteins ADAM9 and CTSS
This cell culture system became a valuable tool to examine the cellular responses of bipolar/rod-shaped microglia toward pathological stimuli, such as Aβ fibrils and NFTs.
Interestingly, inhibition of ADAM9 promoted the activity of α-secretase to generate more sAPP-α and thus reduced the production of Aβ
CTSS is identified as one of the key plaque-induced genes and its up-regulation in microglia might contribute to the formation of Aβ plaques in a mouse model of AD
Taken together, a switch between amoeboid microglia and bipolar/rod-shaped microglia may contribute to neuroprotection in AD.

MICROGLIA-RELATED RISK FACTORS FOR LATE-ONSET ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Several genetic and environmental factors are known to involve in the pathogenesis of AD
Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies reported that several novel genetic variants associated with late-onset AD are related to inflammatory responses, suggesting that microglia are in involved in modulating late-onset AD pathogenesis
Among the microglia-related genetic factors in late-onset AD, INPP5D, which encodes the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase, is an AD risk gene preferentially expressed in microglia
INPP5D is expressed at low level in normal brain; however, the AD-associated INPP5D polymorphism (rs35349669) increased INPP5D gene expression in the brain and whole blood in patients with late-onset AD
Previous study demonstrated that overexpression of INPP5D inhibited phagocytosis in cultured macrophage cell line
Interestingly, activated microglia around the Aβ plaques showed increased in INPP5D immunoreactivity in 5xFAD mice
Pharmaceutical blockade of INPP5D and its paralog INPPL1 promoted the internalization of soluble Aβ oligomers and apoptotic neurons in cultured primary microglia
Notably, a specific rare coding variant (rs72824905, p.P522R) in the gene encoding a microglia-specific phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2) protein that confers protection against AD
Genetic deletion of PLCG2 significantly impaired the microglial phagocytic capacity via a TREM2-dependent signaling pathways, suggesting that PLCG2 is required for microglial phagocytosis
Overexpression of PLCG2-P522R promoted microglial activation with elevated production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
Another novel nonsynonymous variant ABI3 (rs616338, p.Ser209Phe), increased the risk for the development of late-onset AD
The ABI3 immunoreactivity was barely detectable in the brains of cognitively normal human; however, ABI3 was preferentially expressed in activated microglia in close proximity to Aβ plaques in AD patients
Genetic deletion of ABI3 exacerbated Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice.
Since ABI3 is known to regulate actin cytoskeleton organization
More importantly, cultured microglia with ABI3 deletion displayed defective microglial phagocytosis which might also accounted for the increased Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice
It is known that severe niacin deficiency is a cause of dementia, and dietary intake of niacin protected individuals from the development of AD
Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2) is a receptor for niacin which is specifically expressed in microglia.
A recent study demonstrated that HCAR2 was significantly up-regulated in AD patients and mouse models of AD.
Genetic deletion of HCAR2 markedly impaired the uptake of Aβ deposition by microglia, leading to an increase in Aβ deposition and cognitive functional impairment in 5xFAD mice.
Interestingly, activation of HCAR2 by using an FDA-approved formulation of niacin (Niaspan) reduced Aβ deposition and neuronal loss, resulting in improved cognitive function in 5xFAD mice

FUTURE PERSPECTIVE: THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS TARGETING MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOGENESIS
Currently, FDA-approved drugs available for AD patients are mainly cholinesterase inhibitors which partially improve the cognitive function of AD patients
Several disease-modifying therapies are currently undergoing different phases of clinical trials
For instance, oral administration of CNP520 (a BACE inhibitor) showed worsen cognitive functions in cognitively unimpaired participants with clinical evidence of elevated Aβ loads, leading to early termination of phase 3 clinical trials
Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that bind to Aβ monomers, oligomers, and fibrils
Phase 2 clinical trials showed promising results in reducing Aβ loads and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in mild-to-moderate AD patients treated with bapineuzumab
However, no significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in mild-to-moderate AD patients treated with bapineuzumab during a large-scale phase 3 clinical trials
In 2019, five on-going clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies (aducanumab, crenezumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab)
For aducanumab, the results of phase 3 clinical trials were also disappointing.
AD patients treated with aducanumab showed no cognitive improvement
Similarly, solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab failed to prevent cognitive decline and improve cognitive function in mild-to-moderate AD patients during phases 2 and 3 clinical trials
Another therapeutic approach is to target the deposition of NFTs that made up of hyperphosphorylated tau
Several tau aggregation inhibitors have been developed and currently undergoing clinical trials at different phases.
Leuco-methylthioninium (LMTX) was a second-generation tau aggregation inhibitor that are undergoing phase 3 clinical trials.
Interestingly, one phase 3 clinical trial on low-dose LMTX monotherapy showed some cognitive improvement in mild-to-moderate AD patients.
Currently, a third phase 3 clinical trial is still on-going with the results expected to complete in early 2023
Two tau aggregation inhibitors (AADvac1 and zagotenemab) are currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trial; however, the clinical outcomes are yet to determined.
Treating transgenic rats expressing truncated tau proteins with AADvac1 effectively reduced the amount of NFTs deposition in the brain
Transgenic mice expressing mutant tau proteins treated with MC-1 (derivatives of zagotenemab) greatly reduced the amount of hyperphosphorylated tau and NFTs in the forebrain
A recent study highlighted the importance of NFTs formation in reducing gray matter volume and inducing cognitive function impairment in AD patients
The severity of cognitive impairment in AD patients is well-correlated with the density of NFT aggregates
However, the density of Aβ plaques might not correlate well with the severity of dementia
Therefore, NFTs formation-related processes that are potential targets for therapeutic intervention would have better clinical outcomes than do therapies targeting Aβ production
Microglial transcriptomic analysis demonstrate that microglial activation often precedes the deposition of Aβ plaques and NFTs in AD patients and mouse models of AD
By modulating the phenotypic states of microglia at the early stage of AD might be considered as an effective therapeutic approach to slow down or even stop disease progression.
In homeostatic conditions, microglia are heterogeneous and functionally diverse with high expression of homeostatic microglia signature genes such as Tmem119 and P2ry12
Although the functions of homeostatic microglia signature genes remain largely unknown, dramatic decline in homeostatic markers indicates a loss of homeostatic microglial function in the progression of AD
The precise role of Trem2 in AD pathogenesis still remains to be highly controversial despite several studies showing that deletion of Trem2 restored homeostatic microglia signature gene expression
In contrast, another studies reported that deletion of Trem2 or Trem2 haploinsufficiency augmented Aβ deposition in both APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice
However, it is now clear that ApoE has a detrimental role during AD pathogenesis.
In fact, the expression of ApoE was markedly increased in microglia adjacent to Aβ plaques
ApoE is known to induce transcription of APP and increase Aβ synthesis in cultured neurons
Genetic ablation of ApoE restored homeostatic microglia signature gene expression, and protected the neurons from apoptosis 7 days after facial nerve axotomy
Pharmaceutical blockade of ApoE by neutralizing antibodies against ApoE promoted microglial phagocytosis of Aβ plaques and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e.,  in APP/PS-1 mice
Similarly, treating young APP/PS-1 mice with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that specifically reduced ApoE expression, Aβ pathology was significantly reduced at 16 weeks
To this end, these studies highlight the fact that ApoE might serve as an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention of AD.
Several therapeutic interventions that aim to reduce neuroinflammation in the early stage of AD are currently at various phases of clinical trials for AD
Pioglitazone, agonist of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), which is known to reduce the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and has been shown to be effective to slow down Aβ deposition and improve cognitive function in MCI patients
Azeliragon, a small-molecule inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), is able to reduce Aβ deposition, ameliorate the production of IL-1 and TNF-α, and improve spatial memory function in a mouse model of AD
Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrated that azeliragon delayed cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients
Taken together, modulation of the phenotypic states of microglia exhibit significant therapeutic potential to slow down AD progression given that further investigation is required to determine optimal timing of intervention.
With the exponential growth in the availability of microglial transcriptomic data, researchers can take this opportunity to perform in-depth in silico drug screening to identify bioactive small molecules that can restore the homeostatic microglia and inhibit ApoE-mediated signaling pathways for the effective treatment of AD

FIGURE 1 | Microglial priming during normal aging.
In healthy individuals, microglia are active immune surveillant cells that expressed a wide variety of marker genes for homeostatic microglia.
During normal aging, the increased DNA damage and oxidative stress, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins, dead cells and other waste products, induced activation of microglia leading to the down-regulation of homeostatic microglia marker gene expressions.
Also, these activated "primed" microglia expressed high levels of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), surface marker proteins (CD11b, CD68, and CD86) and various Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
These primed microglia often displayed defective phagocytic capacity and decreased motility toward chemoattractants.
The elevated production of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory cytokines lost their neuroprotection to support neurons.

FIGURE 2 | Microglia modulates Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation via the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that comprises a sensor protein NLRP3, an adaptor protein apoptosis-associated spec-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and an effector protein caspase-1.
In AD conditions, microglial surface receptors CD36 cooperates with TLR4-TLR6 heterodimers to recognize and internalize the Aβ oligomers and fibrils, which induces translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) from the cytosol to the nucleus, and the subsequent activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the formation of the adaptor proteins ASC aggregates, which bridge the sensor protein NLRP3 and activated the effector protein from pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1.
Activated caspase-1 cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into active pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18.
In addition, the speck-like aggregates of ASC proteins could be released to extracellular space and bound to the surrounding soluble Aβ led to the formation of ASC-Aβ composites.
The formation of ASC-Aβ composites promoted the Aβ aggregation and served as a major driver for the formation of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

FIGURE 3 | Disease-associated microglia (DAM) and their transformation during the pathogenesis of AD.
In healthy individuals, microglia usually adopt a ramified morphology and expressed a diverse variety of marker genes for homeostatic microglia.
In the early pathogenesis of AD that preceded the deposition of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the homeostatic microglia transformed into a highly proliferative state and elevated the production of various chemokines and other inflammatory genes.
When Aβ plaque loads gradually increased, some of the microglia down-regulated the expression of the homeostatic microglial marker genes, transformed into stage 1 DAM with elevated expression of Tyrobp and Apoe via TREM2-independent pathways, and started colonizing near the Aβ plaques.
With the increase in Aβ and NFT deposition, the stage 1 DAM slowly transformed into fully activated stage 2 DAM via TREM2-dependent pathways.
These stage 2 DAM were highly phagocytic and involved in the active internalization of Aβ plaques via activation of genes involved in phagocytosis and lipid metabolisms.
