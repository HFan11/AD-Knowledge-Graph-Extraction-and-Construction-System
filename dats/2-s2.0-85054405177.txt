Integrative approach to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease: deficiency of TYROBP in a tauopathy mouse model reduces C1q and normalizes clinical phenotype while increasing spread and state of phosphorylation of tau
TYROBP/DAP12 forms complexes with ectodomains of immune receptors (TREM2, SIRPβ1, CR3) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a network hub and driver in the complement subnetwork identified by multi-scale gene network studies of postmortem human AD brain.
Using transgenic or viral approaches, we characterized in mice the effects of TYROBP deficiency on the phenotypic and pathological evolution of tauopathy.
Biomarkers usually associated with worsening clinical phenotype (i.e., hyperphosphorylation and increased tauopathy spreading) were unexpectedly increased in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice despite the improved learning behavior and synaptic function relative to controls with normal levels of TYROBP.
Notably, levels of complement cascade initiator C1q were reduced in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice, consistent with the prediction that C1q reduction exerts a neuroprotective effect.
These observations suggest a model wherein TYROBP-KO-(knock-out)-associated reduction in C1q is associated with normalized learning behavior and electrophysiological properties in tauopathy model mice despite a paradoxical evolution of biomarker signatures usually associated with neurological decline.

Introduction
TYROBP (tyrosine motif binding protein, aka DAP12, DNAX-binding protein-12) has been identified as a causal regulator of multiple genes involved in microglia phagocytosis, and its expression is increased in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mouse models of cerebral amyloidosis
TYROBP is a transmembrane signaling polypeptide and contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain.
TYROBP serves as an adaptor for, and forms functional complexes with, immune receptor ectodomains, including the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)
In the brain, TYROBP is expressed in microglia and dendritic cells.
In humans, deletion and nonsense mutations in the TYROBP gene cause polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy also known as Nasu-Hakola disease
Additionally, missense mutations in TYROBP have been reported to be associated with familial AD
Through an integrative network-based approach, members of our group identified TYROBP as a key regulator in the complement subnetwork family from late-onset AD (LOAD)
Other investigators have reported that TYROBP is involved in specifying a microglial shift from a homeostatic phenotype to a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype
Along with others, we have reported that absence of TYROBP in amyloid-depositing mouse models reduces microglia clustering around amyloid plaque
Importantly, we showed that constitutive Tyrobp deletion in amyloid-depositing mice co-expressing APP KM670/671NL and PSEN1 Δexon9 (hereafter APP/PSEN1) prevented learning deficits and electrophysiological abnormalities during the early stages of amyloid deposition
There is a longstanding debate about how much of the neurodegeneration in AD is due to direct proteotoxicity and how much is due to a "neuroinflammation-bystander" effect.
Microglia are the main intrinsic cell type implicated in the inflammatory response in the brain and spinal cord.
Currently, models hold that microglia can be protective early in the evolution of AD-associated proteinopathy by participating in clearance of protein aggregates, but as the disease progresses, they become inefficient at clearance and release pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to neurotoxicity.
Although there is an extensive literature on the interaction of microglia with amyloid aggregates and deposits, the interaction of microglia with tauopathy is relatively less extensively studied.
Recent studies have shown that depletion of microglia dramatically suppresses propagation of tauopathy and that effect could be exosome dependent since blockage of exosomes also reduced propagation of tauopathy
In addition to the role of microglia in the propagation of tauopathy, lipopolysaccharides-mediated inflammatory stimuli via injection in MAPT P301S transgenic mice facilitated tau phosphorylation while inducing activation of CD45 and arginase 1 (histological markers of microglia
These results illustrate the role of microglia and inflammation in determining the phosphorylation status of tau.
Because of the reports showing the involvement of microglia in mouse models of tauopathy, we sought to determine the effect of Tyrobp deletion on the phenotype of the MAPT P301S mouse (also known as PS19).
In the Tyrobp -/-mouse, there is a deletion of exons 3 and 4 resulting in loss-of-function of the TYROBP protein by loss of the transmembrane region and part of the cytoplasmic region including the first tyrosine of the ITAM
The MAPT P301S mice express the human MAPT transgene, which encodes the disease-associated P301S mutation and includes four microtubule-binding domains and one N-terminal insert (4R/1N)
The deletion of Tyrobp in MAPT P301S mice led to an unusual constellation of biomarkers and physiological features.
Indeed, MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice presented an altered phenotype characterized by apparent increases both in the level of tau phosphorylation and in the rapidity of spread of tauopathy through the brain.
Despite the conventional wisdom that these biomarker changes would typically be associated with a decline in clinical function, the increased levels of both tau phosphorylation and tauopathy propagation in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice were accompanied by improvement in both clinical and electrophysiological functions.
As we reported in our study of APP/PSEN1;Tyrobp -/-mice
This consistent association of C1q reduction with Tyrobp KO in a variety of crosses suggests a role for TYROBP in the physiological and/or pathological complement-mediated actions of microglia, perhaps including synaptic sculpting

Materials and methods

Animals
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
MAPT P301S (PS19) and Tyrobp knock-out (KO) mice (Tyrobp -/-) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and Taconic/Merck Laboratory, respectively.
MAPT P301S mice were crossed with Tyrobp -/-mice to obtain MAPT P301S mice heterozygous (MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp +/-) or KO (MAPT P301S ; Tyrobp -/-) for Tyrobp.
Both males and females were used.
TREM2-deficient mice were constructed by targeted homologous recombination
In contrast to the recently reported Velocigene construct, the direction of the Hygromycin cassette was "reversed".
Crucially, in agreement with two other models, but in contrast to the Velocigene construct, reverse transcriptase (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses confirmed (data not shown) specific loss of Trem2 expression without the perturbation of Treml1 expression observed in the Velocigene construct
We used a minimum of n = 4-5 mice per group (n = 7-11 for the Fig.
The exact sample size (n) for each experiment can be found in each figure legend.

AAV injection

Neonatal mice
WT or Tyrobp -/-mice at P0 were used in this experiment.
Pups were anesthetized on an ice-cold metal plate.
Intraventricular brain injection was performed using a Hamilton syringe and 2 μl of virus preparation (AAV8-CBA-MAPT P301L , 1.10 12 vg/site, designated henceforth as AAVtau) was injected into both hemispheres.
Immediately after the injection, pups were placed on a heating blanket.
Brains were examined at 6.5 months of age.

Adult mice
WT and Tyrobp -/-mice at 4 months of age were used in this experiment.
Mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (80/16 mg/kg body weight) and placed in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA).
Stereotactic intracerebral injections of virus (AAV8-CBA-MAPT P301L -GFP, designated AAVtau-GFP) was performed into layer II/III of medial entorhinal cortex (Ent) bilaterally via the following coordinates: anteroposterior, -4.75 mm; mediolateral, 2.9; dorsoventral, -4.6.
We injected 1 μl of virus into each site (1.10 12 vg/site) at a rate of 0.2 μl/min.
Mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, or 6 weeks after injection.

Tissue collection and sample preparation
Mice were anesthetized in a CO 2 chamber and then transcardially perfused with 20 ml ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS).
One hemisphere was post-fixed by incubation for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and cut into 35 μm sections with a vibratome (Leica) for histological analyses.
The contralateral hemisphere was dissected for isolation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and cortex.
The PFC was used for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR, whereas hippocampal, cortical and spinal cord samples were homogenized in a RIPA buffer (Pierce) containing phosphatase (Pierce) and protease (Roche) inhibitors, centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g and the supernatant was used.

Western blotting
Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in precast 4-12% Bis-Tris Gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to activated/pre-wetted polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
The membranes were hybridized with the following primary antibodies as indicated: AT8 anti-Ptau pSer202/Thr205 (1:500, Thermo Scientific, #MN1020); anti-P-tau pS396 (1:1000, Abcam, #ab109390); anti-total tau T46 (1:1000, Thermo Scientific, #13-6400); anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Santa Cruz, #sc-32233); anti-P-CaMKII (1:1000, Abcam, #ab32678); anti-PSD-95 (1:1000, Millipore, #7E3-1B8), C1q (1:1000, Abcam, #ab182451).
Secondary antibodies included: peroxidase-labeled antimouse IgG (1:2000, Vector Laboratories); peroxidaselabeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Vector Laboratories); peroxidase-labeled anti-rat IgG (1:2000, Vector Laboratories).
ECL (Pierce®) was used to reveal the immunoreactive proteins, and images were acquired using a Fujifilm ImageReader LAS-4000.
Membranes were stripped using a stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific) when required.
Luminescent immunoreactive protein bands were quantified using Fiji software (ImageJ).

Immunohistochemistry and image acquisition
Coronal or sagittal sections (35 µm thickness) were washed with 0.1% Triton in PBS, saturated by incubation with 0.1% Triton in PBS/5% goat serum, and then incubated with primary antibodies as follows: AT8 anti-P-tau pSer202/ Thr205 (1/500, Thermo Scientific, #MN1020); anti-P-tau pS396 (1/1000, Abcam, #ab109390); anti-IBA1 (1/1000, Wako, #019-19741), CD68 (1/500, Bio-Rad, #MCA1957) and anti-C1q (1/1000, Abcam, #ab182451).
For fluorescent immunostaining, sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody: anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1/2000, Invitrogen); anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 or 568
For non-fluorescent immunostaining, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with PBS containing 3% H 2 O 2 for 15 min followed by amplification using the ABC system (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Horseradish peroxidase conjugates and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine were used according to the manufacturer's manual (Vector® DAB, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Images were obtained with an Olympus BX61 microscope and analyzed with Fiji software (ImageJ).

Behavioral assessment

Barnes maze
Six-and 10-month-old mice were transported from their cage to the center of the platform via a closed starting chamber where they remained for 10 s prior to exploring the maze for 3 min.
Mice failing to enter the escape box within 3 min were guided to the escape box by the experimenter, and the latency recorded was noted as 180 s.
Mice were allowed to remain in the escape box for 1 min before the next trial.
Two trials per day during 4 consecutive days were performed.
The platform and the escape box were wiped with 70% ethanol after each trial to eliminate any residual olfactory cues that could enable location of the target hole.
All trials were recorded by video camera and analyzed with ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, USA).

Novel object recognition
The tests were performed in a white rectangular open field (36 × 26 × 22.5 cm) with sawdust bedding.
During the training phase, mice were placed in the experimental apparatus with two different objects (100 mL beakers; blue Lego blocks) and were allowed to explore for 10 min.
Objects were cleaned with ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues.
Long-term learning behavior (retention test) was tested 24 h after training on the following day.
During the retention test, mice explored the experimental apparatus for 5 min with one familiar and one novel object.
All trials were recorded by video camera and analyzed with ANYmaze video tracking software (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, USA).
The behavior assessment was performed with the operator blinded to mouse identity.

Ex vivo electrophysiology
Coronal brain slices containing the hippocampal formation were prepared as previously described
Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and brains were rapidly removed from the skull and placed in an ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing: 215 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.6 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 4 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO 3 (pH = 7.4, equilibrated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ).
Coronal brain slices (400 µm thick) were prepared with a Vibratome VT1000S (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and then incubated at room temperature for ≥ 3 h in a physiologic ACSF, containing: 120 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM KCl, 1.2 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1.3 mM MgSO 4 , 1.8 mM CaCl 2 , 11 mM glucose (pH = 7.4 equilibrated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ).
The hemi-slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with ACSF at a flow rate of ~2 mL/min using a peristaltic pump; experiments were performed at 28.0 ± 0.1 °C.
Recordings were acquired with a GeneClamp 500B amplifier and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices).
All signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz.
For extracellular field recordings (field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings), a patch-type pipette was fabricated on a micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments), filled with ACSF, and placed in the middle third of stratum radiatum in area CA1.
fEPSPs were evoked by activating Shaffer collaterals with a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc.) placed in the middle third of stratum radiatum 150-200 µm away from the recording pipette.
Square-wave current pulses (60 µs pulse width) were delivered through a stimulus isolator (Isoflex, AMPI).
Input-output curves were generated by a series of stimuli in 0.1 mA steps.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced after 20 min of stable baseline recordings (one stimulus every 30 s), using stimuli that yielded a response equal to 30-40% of spike threshold, by theta burst stimulation, which consisted in a series of 10 bursts of 4 stimuli (100 Hz within the burst, 200 ms interburst interval) repeated four times (10 s apart) and delivered at an intensity that yielded a baseline response equal to 75% of spike threshold.
Long-term depression (LTD) was induced after 20 min of stable baseline recording by treating the slices with (RS)-3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a selective mGluR 1/mGluR 5 agonist, at 100 µM for 5 min.
fEPSPs were collected for 60 min after the start of DHPG.
All recordings were performed blind.

Molecular biological analyses

RT-qPCR
RNAs were isolated from PFCs using the QIAzol® Lysis Reagent (Qiagen) and the miRNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen).
For RT-qPCR analyses, the abundance of each transcript of interest was normalized to the abundance of L32 with the ΔCt method.
The All-in-One qPCR Mix (GeneCopoeia) was used to perform RT-qPCR.
The sequences of oligonucleotides used:
C1q: Fwd 5′-AACCTCGGATACCAGTCCG-3′; Rev 5′-ATGGGGCTCCAGGAAATC-3′; TREM2: Fwd 5′-GAGTCAATCCAGCCTGCATG-3′; Rev 5′-TGACAGACAACCATCCAGCT-3′; CD68: Fwd 5′-TGTCTGATCTTGCTAGGACCG-3′; Rev 5′-GAGAGTAACGGCCTTTTTGTGA-3′.

RNA sequencing
RNA-seq assays were performed using total RNAs after ribosomal RNA depletion by Ribo-Zero.
In all, 100-nt singleend reads were generated via the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system.
Sequencing reads were aligned to mouse reference genome mm10 (GRCm38.90)
using STAR aligner guided by mouse GENCODE gene model release v15.
All processed total RNA samples had RQN/RIN value of 8.2 or greater.
To confirm the expression of human tau gene in the MAPT P301S mice, a pseudochromosome with the human MAPT gene sequence was inserted into the mouse reference genome.
Accepted mapped reads were summarized to gene levels using the featureCounts program.
Raw count data were normalized by the voom function in the R limma package and then differential expression was identified by the moderated t-test implemented in limma.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined to have at least 1.2-fold change in expression and Benjamini-Hochberg

Results

Microglial TYROBP deficiency is associated with increased hyperphosphorylation of tau in transgenic and virus-induced mouse models of tauopathy
We first assessed the connection between microgliosis and tau pathology using anti-IBA1 (for microglia) and AT8 (for hyperphosphorylated tau on epitopes pS202/pT205) on WT and MAPT P301S mice, which express a human microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) harboring the P301S mutation linked to familial tauopathy
Although microglia displayed activated morphology in MAPT P301S mice compared with WT (Supplementary Figure
We evaluated tau phosphorylation status in the hippocampus, cortex and spinal cord of 2-month-old male and female MAPT P301S mice that are either wild-type (WT), heterozygous or homozygous KO for Tyrobp (Fig.
Western blot analyses using AT8 and pS396 antibodies (Fig.
Increased phospho-tau within brains from MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp +/-and MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice was further confirmed immunohistochemically (Fig.
Because similar results were observed in males and females, both sexes were included in the follow-up experiments.
To confirm these results using another modeling strategy and another MAPT mutation, we used intracerebroventricular injections of an adenoassociated virus (AAV) with the chicken β-actin (CBA) promoter directing expression of the human MAPT complementary DNA harboring the P301L mutation (designated AAV-tau).
We injected WT and Tyrobp -/-P0 pups and characterized them at 6.5 months (Fig.
Quantification of pS202/pT205 and pS396 phospho-epitopes within both hippocampus and cortex demonstrated increased levels of phospho-tau in Tyrobp -/-mice injected with AAV-tau as compared with the levels in the WT mice injected with AAV-tau (Fig.
Consistent with this result, we also observed an accumulation of phosphorylated-tau in CA1 hippocampal neurons by immunohistochemistry in these same mice (Fig.
Thus, two different modeling strategies demonstrated that TYROBP deficiency leads to elevated levels of phospho-tau.
Having established that TYROBP deficiency or absence increases tau phosphorylation, we evaluated the potential involvement of selected protein kinases such as GSK3β, CDK5 or DYRK1A.
No differences between levels of the transcripts for these enzymes were observed by immunoblotting or RT-qPCR when MAPT P301S mice were compared against MAPT P301S ; Tyrobp -/-mice (data not shown).
It is well known that microglia form a physical barrier around amyloid plaques, and that barrier is disrupted in the absence of Tyrobp
Thereby, we predicted that a deletion of Tyrobp in MAPT P301S mice could alter the spread of soluble forms of tau.
To test this hypothesis, we injected AAV encoding MAPT P301L gene tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (AAV-tau-GFP) in the entorhinal cortex of 4-month-old mice WT or Tyrobp -/- [12] (Fig.
GFP expression was identified in neurons in the entorhinal cortex and perforant pathway in the first week following injection (Supplementary Figure
In Tyrobp -/-mice injected with the AAV-tau-GFP, several GFP-positive neurons were evident in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus (GrDG) beginning 1 week after injection, but no cells were detectable at this stage in the injected WT mice (Fig.
Consistent with this observation, we observed GFP-positive neurons in a more medial GrDG in the Tyrobp -/-mice, 3 weeks after injection.
We also observed GFP-positive neurons in the GrDG of Tyrobp -/-mice 6 weeks after injection and, to a lesser extent, in WT mice (Fig.
These data indicate that an absence of TYROBP promotes the spread of tau.
This tau spreading phenomenon probably accounts for the diffuse pattern of increased AT8 staining (see Figs.

TYROBP deficiency is associated with an altered microglial phenotype
We previously showed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry that a deficiency of TYROBP in a WT background does not modify microglia number and phenotype in 4-month-old WT mice
To determine whether the increased level and diffusion of phosphorylated tau in MAPT P301S mice KO for Tyrobp is associated with an altered microglial morphology, we performed anti-IBA1 immunohistochemistry on 4-month-old MAPT P301S mice KO or WT for Tyrobp (Fig.
There was a marked reduction in IBA1 staining intensity, as well as a reduction of the soma diameter in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-microglia as compared with MAPT P301S with normal level of TYROBP (Fig.
Moreover, we observed in the hippocampus of MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-a dramatic reduction in the immunocytochemical signal for CD68, a lysosomal-localized indicator of microglial phagocytic activity (Fig.
We confirmed the reduction of CD68 protein at the mRNA level by RT-qPCR in the PFC of MAPT P301S and MAPT P301 ; Tyrobp -/-(Fig.
We also noticed a decrease of the IBA1 intensity in the Tyrobp -/-mice injected with the AAV-tau-GFP in the entorhinal cortex (Fig.
This was similar to the effect that we observe when AAV-tau was injected at P0 (see Fig.

Deletion of Tyrobp in MAPT P301S mice is associated with reduction in levels of key complement protein C1q
TYROBP has been identified in LOAD patients as a key regulator of the complement subnetwork
C1q is the recognition component of C1, the classical complement pathway multi-subunit complex, and is a member of the complement subnetwork regulated by TYROBP in AD patients
Microglia are the main source of C1q in the mouse brain
We performed RT-qPCR in the PFC of 4-month-old MAPT P301S mice WT or KO for Tyrobp.
Absence of TYROBP was associated with a significant reduction in the levels of C1q mRNA (Fig.
We confirmed the decreased C1q expression by western blot (Fig.
Notably, the areas of reduced C1q-like immunoreactivity in the brain of MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice were regions that are particularly rich in synapses, including hippocampal CA2 and dentate gyrus
We also observed an apparent reduction in the extent to which C1q-positive patches were detected in the cortex and striatum (Fig.
These results indicate that TYROBP deficiency leads to a reduction in levels of the complement system protein C1q in tauopathy mice.
This effect is the opposite of situation in brain aging and AD where C1q levels are abnormally elevated
TREM2 deficiency exacerbates tauopathy without causing a reduction in levels of C1q RNA or protein TYROBP is the direct adaptor of TREM2 and variants in the TREM2 gene increase the risk for developing AD
However, the role of TREM2 in AD and tauopathy are not yet fully understood.
One recent report showed that TREM2 deficiency could attenuate tauopathy, thereby resulting in apparent benefits as measured by functional or biomarker assays
We compared MAPT P301S mice on a WT background with those on a Trem2-null or Tyrobp-null background at 4 months of age.
As above, the stoichiometry of phospho-tau standardized to total tau was elevated in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-extract but unchanged in MAPTP 301S ;Trem2 -/-mice (Supplementary Figure
We confirmed these results by immunohistochemistry using a second antibody, which recognizes the phosphorylated pS396 epitope of tau (Supplementary Figure
Interestingly, at 8 months of age, we were able to detect an increased level of phospho-tau in MAPTP 301S ; Trem2 -/-mice as compared with MAPT P301S mice (Supplementary Figure
However, we did not observe any reduction of C1q protein or mRNA in MAPTP 301S ;Trem2 -/- as compared with MAPTP 301S (Supplementary Figure
Together, these data indicate that increased tau phosphorylation results from either TYROBP or TREM2 deficiency, but the two follow different time courses, perhaps explaining the apparent contradictions in the literature among some recent studies.
Deficiency of TREM2, however, did not lead to a reduction in C1q levels.

Deletion of Tyrobp is associated with improved behavioral performance
We recently showed that the functional status of a mouse model of amyloidosis is sustained in the presence of a Fig.
a Wild-type or Tyrobp -/-P0 pups received intracerebroventricular injections of AAV8-Tau P301L (designated AAV-tau) using a chicken β-actin (CBA) promoter.
Brains were examined at age 6.5 months.
b Representative western blots of extracts from cortical and hippocampal regions of wild-type (WT) or Tyrobp -/-mice injected with AAV-tau using antibodies as indicated: antibody AT8 (detects paired helical filament epitopes of tau phosphorylated at residues serine 202 and/or threonine 205); antibody anti-tau (phospho S 396 ) (detects tau phosphorylated at residue serine 396); antibody T46 (detects total tau); anti-GAPDH.
Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Figure
n = 5 (WT and Tyrobp -/-) for extracts from hippocampus and n = 4 (WT) or n = 5 (Tyrobp -/-) for extracts from cortex.
Error bars represent means ± SEM.
Both males and females were used, and analysis was performed on combined results.
Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's t-test, **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns nonsignificant.

e AAV8-Tau P301L -GFP (designated AAV-tau-GFP) was injected in the medial entorhinal cortex to study the spread of tau from this structure to the hippocampus.
AP anteroposterior, ML mediolateral, DV dorsoventral.
The perforant pathway connecting these two regions is implicated in this spread, although the diffuseness of the immunoreactivity raises the possibility that spread may occur via the interstitium in addition to (or instead of) via neuronal uptake and transneuronal propagation along the classical neuroanatomic pathway.
f Wild-type or Tyrobp -/-mice were injected with AAV-tau-GFP at 4 months of age, and brains were examined at 1, 3 or 6 weeks after injection (n = 3 per group).
Males and females were used for experiments, and results were combined for analysis.
Ctx cortex, Str striatum, Hp hippocampus, Ent entorhinal cortex, GrDG granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus genetic Tyrobp deletion
Moreover, it has been suggested that the microglial-and complement-dependent pathways that prune excess synapses in development are inappropriately activated and mediate synapse loss in AD
Therefore, we hypothesized that the decrease of C1q observed in MAPT P301S mice deficient for TYROBP may also correlate with beneficial effects on learning and memory.
We first evaluated spatial learning and memory using the Barnes Maze task on 6-month-old WT, MAPT P301S and MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice.
Both percentages of time spent and distance traveled in the target quadrant (TQ), the location of the hole for the escape box, were higher in WT and MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice compared with MAPT P301S mice (Fig.
Despite that difference, MAPT P301S mice spent >25% of time and distance in TQ meaning that the deficit in these mice at this age is present,
Scale bar = 200 μm.
Error bars represent means ± SEM.
Males and females were used for experiments, and results were combined for analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's t-test, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 albeit subtle.
Because approximately 80% of MAPT P301S die by 12-13 months of age
Although the impairment is worsened in MAPT P301S at this age, MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/- mice spent >60% of time and distance in TQ on the last day of training (Fig.
We also tested the mice on the Novel Object Recognition task often used to evaluate working memory, attention, anxiety and preference for novelty in rodents
MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice spent significantly more time in the novel object area when compared with the time spent in the area of the familiar object, relative to MAPT P301S mice (Fig.
Consistent with our previous report in an amyloidosis mouse model of AD

TYROBP deficiency alters synaptic pathophysiology in MAPT P301S mice
We next investigated synaptic plasticity in the absence of Tyrobp in MAPT P301S mice.
Basal synaptic efficiency partially restored the abnormal basal synaptic activity observed in MAPT P301S mice (Fig.
We used a synaptic induction protocol to induce a prominent protein synthesis-dependent "late" phase of LTD.
Slices from MAPT P301S mice showed significantly impaired LTD compared with WT, and absence of TYROBP in MAPT P301S mice restored the initial phase of the LTD (Fig.
LTP was also altered in MAPT P301S slices as compared with WT, but there was only a trend for restoration in the absence of TYROBP (Fig.
Although synaptic plasticity as measured by LTP was not fully restored, the level of calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a protein kinase that potentiates synaptic transmission and whose autophosphorylation on threonine 286 is crucial for LTP induction
In summary, these data indicate that Tyrobp deletion in a MAPT P301S tauopathy model improves synaptic plasticity, similar to what we observed in a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis
Gene differential expression in WT, MAPT P301S and MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice at 11 months of age
In order to identify DEGs in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice and to compare them with the network previously obtained by bulk RNA-seq from sporadic LOAD patients
RNA sequence reads mapped to the human MAPT gene confirmed its overexpression in MAPT P301S mice deficient or WT for TYROBP (Supplementary Figure
We identified 69 DEGs in MAPT P301S ; Tyrobp -/-mice compared with MAPT P301S mice.
In comparison with WT mice, 14 DEGs (all upregulated) were identified in MAPT P301S mice, whereas 127 DEGs were identified in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice (Supplementary Figure
All the 14 upregulated DEGs in MAPT P301S mice were also significantly upregulated in MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice (Supplementary Figure
Overall, we observed 23 downregulated and 22 upregulated DEGs common between the MAPT P301S ; Tyrobp -/-vs MAPT P301S and the MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-vs WT comparisons (Supplementary Figure
Apart from Tyrobp that is the top downregulated DEG, Bub1b and Nudt19 that have been proposed as early biomarkers of AD
Only 14 upregulated DEGs were identified when comparing MAPT P301S and WT mice, and we previously identified only 11 and 21 DEGs at 4 and 8 months of age, respectively, in PFC samples from WT and Tyrobp -/-mice (data not shown).
Together, these data indicate that absence of TYROBP does not modify the transcriptome in the absence of another stressor at the large effect sizes we were powered to see with our small sample sizes.
Interestingly, the 24 DEGs between MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-and MAPT P301S (on 69) did not overlap with those between MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-and WT comparison (Supplementary Table

Discussion
In summary, using a variety of in vivo mouse model systems, we have observed (1) that a deficiency of TYROBP in microglia is associated with increased phospho-tau stoichiometry and accelerated spread of tauopathy in mouse models; (2) that the deletion of Tyrobp induces a decrease of C1q, which may underlie the beneficial effects on memory and synaptic plasticity; (3) that TREM2 deficiency leads to an increased phosphorylation and diffusion of tau but without alteration of the complement cascade.
The key observation in the current study is that phenotypic and pathophysiological symptoms and signs of tauopathy toxicity can be relieved when tauopathy model mice are constitutively deficient in a microglial-/dendritic cell-specific molecule (TYROBP), despite the fact that the severity of the tauopathy is not abated.
Along with others, we recently identified TYROBP as a candidate LOAD hub/driver
In AD amyloidosis mouse models, absence of TYROBP decreases recruitment of microglia around amyloid plaques
This altered accumulation of plaque-associated microglia has been proposed to lead to impairment of the compaction of amyloid deposits
Several studies have suggested that microglia might play significant roles not only in pathophysiology of amyloidosis but also in the pathophysiology of tauopathy
In addition to the central involvement of microglia in inflammation and cytokine production, data indicate that reactive microglia can enhance tau pathology by promoting tauopathy spread.
The first study along this line provided evidence that activated microglia can participate in both the induction of tau pathology and in its subsequent transneuronal spread
Another study provided further evidence that microglia can promote tau dissemination and that depleting microglia suppresses tauopathy propagation
In the face of these precedents, our report that Tyrobp deletion promotes tauopathy spread and tau phosphorylation is especially surprising because these biomarkers that are usually associated with disease progression develop in the face of apparent reduction in phenotypic and functional clinical features.
Among a variety of propagation mechanisms such as transneuronal and trans-synaptic diffusions, tau also spreads via the extracellular space
Moreover, TREM2 and TYROBP play critical roles in the formation of the microglia barrier around amyloid plaques
Thus, our current results suggest that TYROBP may play a specific role in detection by microglia of the presence of free, soluble tau in brain interstices and thereby plays a role in limiting the diffusion of tau through the brain.
This could potentially explain our observation of increased tau spread in the presence of decreased microgliosis.
Another unexpected biomarker observation that we report here is an increase in the levels of phospho-tau, again despite the improvement in clinical phenotype.
Although this result is discrepant with many early observations on clinicophosphorylation status correlation, there is at least one tau phosphorylation site located at residue Thr 205 and recognized by antibody AT8, for which increased stoichiometry of phosphorylation exerts a beneficial/protective effect in the prevention or neutralization of Aβ toxicity
The other potential phospho-acceptor sites typically associated with tau hyperphosphorylation and toxicity include Ser 9 , Ser 26 , Thr 175 , Ser 199 , Thr 231 , Ser 262 , Ser 356 and Ser 396
Ser 396 was also increased by TYROBP deficiency, suggesting that multiple competing effects are occurring simultaneously, indicating that the beneficial effects are apparently sufficiently robust to overcome the competing detrimental effects.
What are the molecular, cellular and subcellular underpinnings of the collection of apparently disparate features of the MAPT P301S ;Tyrobp -/-mice?
One of the most puzzling set of traits is the paradoxical clinical and electrophysiological benefit despite an increase in tauopathy spread.
It is indeed intriguing that a deficiency of TYROBP leading to an altered microglia barrier increases tau phosphorylation and spread while it has been previously reported that depletion of microglia dramatically suppresses the propagation of tau and that reactive microglia drive tau spreading
It is also logical to compare the effects of TYROBP or TREM2 deficiency on tauopathy, although this is somewhat difficult due to discrepant findings reported to date from Trem2 KOs crossed with mouse models of tauopathy
The failure to decrease tau phosphorylation, however, is present in all studies so far, as is the decrease in several aspects of microglial activation compared with tauopathy alone.
Electrophysiological and behavior assays were not performed in these other cited studies.
Despite the fact that similar results can be obtained when tauopathy is modulated with either a deficiency of TYROBP or a deficiency of TREM2, a possible explanation for the improvement in behavior and synaptic plasticity is the alteration of the complement system, which is disrupted by Tyrobp deletion, but in our study, not by Trem2 deletion, contrary to the report by Leyns et al.
Specifically, C1q, the initiating protein in the classical complement cascade, is mainly produced by microglia in the brain and dramatically increased during normal aging
One model that has been proposed posits that C1q and the complement system mediate synapse elimination
Moreover, this synapse pruning has been shown to be inappropriately activated in AD
In this regard, it is important to note that C1q is part of the complement subnetwork driven by TYROBP
Considering the higher number of DEGs observed in APP/PSEN1 mice (181 versus WT mice) compared with the 14 DEGs observed in MAPT P301S mice (versus WT mice, FDR ≤ 0.1 in this article versus 0.05 in Haure-Mirande et al.
Therefore, although the improvement of the behavior and the synaptic plasticity seem to be mainly due to a transcriptomic restoration in APP/PSEN1 mice, which appears not to be the case in MAPT P301S mice.
Further investigations of clinicomolecular and clinico-pathological correlations will be required in order to determine what underlies the "improved function yet worsening biomarkers" situation that occurs in TYROBP-deficient MAPT P301S tauopathy mice.
