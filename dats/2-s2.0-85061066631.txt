Protective roles of isoastilbin against Alzheimer's disease via Nrf2‑mediated antioxidation and anti‑apoptosis
By analyzing the L-glutamic acid (L-Glu)-induced apoptosis of Pc12 cells and an Alcl 3 combined with d-galactose (d-gal)-developed Alzheimer's disease (Ad) mouse model, the protective effects of isoastilbin (IAB) against Ad were systematically investigated in the present study.
Pre-incubation with IAB for 3 h prior to treatment with 25 mM L-Glu decreased cell viability and inhibited apoptosis, suppressed the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and restored mitochondrial membrane potential in Pc12 cells induced by L-Glu.
In mice with Ad, the reduced escape latency time in the water maze test, suppressed chronic movement in the center area of an open field test and enhanced ability to seek hidden food in a Y maze test indicated that abnormal behaviors had improved after 28 days of treatment with IAB.
Furthermore, IAB reduced the deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) and the expression of phosphorylated-Tau in the mouse brain and enhanced the serum levels of Aβ.
IAB ameliorated the oxidative stress via modulating the levels of associated enzymes and improved the functioning of the central cholinergic system, as indicated by an increase in acetylcholine and choline acetyltransferase concentrations.
The expression levels of acetylcholine esterase were reduced in the mouse brain in response to IAB pre-treatment.
In cells and brain tissue, IAB regulated the expression levels of proand anti-apoptotic proteins and enhanced the nuclear levels of NF-E2p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2); subsequently, IAB further enhanced the expression of superoxide dismutase 1, catalase, and heme oxygenase-1 and -2.
The findings of the present study indicated that the protection of IAB against Ad is at least partially associated with its antioxidation and anti-apoptotic properties.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (Ad), due to neuron loss and synaptic degeneration, is characterized by a significant decline in cognitive function and poor prognosis, which accounts for 60-70% of all types of dementia
Although the aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) titanium and hyper-phosphorylated (p-) Tau may exhibit neurotoxicity in the development of Ad, the exact therapeutic targets have not been successfully identified due to the complex mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of this disease
Among the various hypotheses, the occurrence of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in Ad has been accepted.
Oxidative stress, represented by the over-accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is responsible for the damage to the mitochondria, membrane lipids, and nucleic acids
Oxidative stress promotes Aβ aggregation, which exhibits a direct toxic effect to its surrounding neurons, leading to the susceptibility of neurons to free radicals, particularly ROS
As a major cellular source of ROS, mitochondria serve an important role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases
The disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis caused by the high levels of ROS further leads to the over-production of ROS and other cytokines, such as cytochrome c, which induces the cell apoptosis program
The extremely high levels of glutamate (Glu) associated with ROS accumulation, a central nervous neurotransmitter, damages neurons

Protective roles of isoastilbin against Alzheimer's disease via Nrf2-mediated antioxidation and anti-apoptosis
structure and functional integrity of the mitochondria
Furthermore, the deletion of Nrf2 can increase the intracellular levels of Aβ in mice with Ad
The occurrence of Ad is rapidly increasing worldwide, and according to statistics, there are >40 million patients globally
As the prevention and treatment of Ad has been a serious challenge, potential agents applied in clinics have failed to effectively treat patients with Ad.
In addition, the adverse effects of these agents have been noted, including gastrointestinal discomfort, difficulty sleeping and muscle spasms
Herbal compounds have been reported as a large and underappreciated source of potential agents to treat or prevent Ad
Evodiamine treatment resulted in the return of Ad-associated symptoms via modulating oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in L-glutamate (L-Glu)-damaged HT22 cells, and a mouse model with Alcl 3 -and d-galactose (d-gal)-induced Ad
Polysaccharides extracted from Sparassis crispa
Isoastilbin (IAB), a dihydroflavonol glycoside compound (Fig.
The majority studies of IAB have focused on its extraction and purification from herbs
A study reported the antioxidative effects of IAB
Based on the pharmacological activity of astilbin and the antioxidative properties of IAB, we hypothesized that IAB may exhibit neuroprotective effects against Ad.
In the present study, the protective effects of IAB on restoring L-Glu-induced Pc12 cell apoptosis, and reducing Alcl 3 -and d-gal-induced Ad-associated symptoms in Balb/c male mice were investigated.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report of the potential therapeutic properties of IAB against Ad in an apoptotic cell model and in mice with Ad-associated symptoms.
The results may provide insight into the application of IAB in the adjuvant therapy of Ad.

Discussion
Apoptotic neurons have been detected in patients with Ad
Based on our preliminary experiments, the neuroprotective effects of numerous natural compounds including IAB, astilbin and curculigoside were screened in L-Glu-damaged Pc12 cells, and the results revealed that IAB exhibited the best protective effects than the other compounds.
In the present study, IAB significantly reduced L-Glu-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells and apoptosis in the brains of mice with Ad, which was induced with Alcl 3 and d-gal.
The notably high levels of Glu in brains is responsible for the occurrence of oxidative stress, as indicated by the over-accumulation of ROS, which opens mitochondrial permeability transition pores, resulting in the further dissipation of MMP
As of the feedback loop between the increased production of ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction, pro-apoptotic cytokines, such as cytochrome c are released from the mitochondria and bind to apoptotic protease activating factor 1
This complex recruits caspase-9 to activate caspase-3 via proteolytic cleavage
consequently, caspase-3 is the executor of the apoptotic program
In L-Glu-damaged Pc12 cells and the brains of mice with Ad, IAB significantly reduced the expression of caspase-9 and -3, and regulated the expression of Bcl-2 family members, which suggests the inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.
Bcl-2 family members, which are located in the membrane of mitochondria, affect mitochondrial apoptosis
The ratio of pro-and anti-apoptotic members can directly reflect the function of mitochondria
Upregulated Bax levels accelerate apoptosis by permeabilizing mitochondria
conversely, the enhanced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL may help improve MMP
The transcription factor Nrf2 supports the structural and functional integrity of the mitochondria
In response to apoptosis, Nrf-2 becomes activated and released, and binds to corresponding proteins in the nucleus to form dimers
This results in the activation and transactivation of HO-1 and HO-2, which consequently leads to the enhanced activities of SOd and cAT
As an antioxidant enzyme, SOd1 helps suppress the toxicity of superoxide radicals
HO-1 and -2 can be activated by Nrf2 under conditions of oxidative stress, which provides powerful protection against oxidative injury
These cascade activations may be associated with the etiology of Ad and provide the possibility for screening therapeutic targets; we speculate that IAB enhanced cascade activation within the Nrf2 pathway, which may be involved in the neuroprotection of IAB against Ad.
during the development of Ad in mice, long-term d-gal and Alcl 3 administration leads to the accumulation of ROS and damage to polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in the brain, which is responsible for the appearance of Ad-like symptoms, including cognitive disorders and dysmnesia
during this process, the aggregation of Aβ can be observed, which induces cascade reactions, such as mitochondrial dysfunction
However, Aβ plaque deposition in the brain disturbs the anti-and pro-oxidation equilibrium and enhances ROS production in particular (51).
Additionally, IAB not only suppressed the abnormal accumulation of Aβ1-42 and p-Tau in the mouse brain, but also regulated the redox system via modulating the expression levels including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and -3 and the activation of the Nrf2 pathway in mice with Ad. combined with the occurrence of oxidative stress, oxidized biomolecules and ROS accumulate in cells, which consequently promotes amyloidogenic APP processing and Aβ overproduction
Under these conditions, Nrf2 activates a series of kinases, including SOd1, cAT, and HO-1 and -2, which in eliminate the accumulated ROS
SOd and GSH-Px, which are representative endogenous antioxidants, have been recognized as the first-line drugs to defend against oxidative damage
combined with the suppressed ROS generation, the cerebral deposition of Aβ can be removed from brains, as evidenced by enhanced peripheral levels
As of the activated Nrf2, the inhibited deposition of Aβ leads to the fragmentation of p-Tau aggregation
These data suggest that the ability of IAB to improve the cognitive performance of mice with Ad may be associated with Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress.
The loss of cholinergic neurotransmission in cerebral areas is responsible for the cognitive deterioration in patients with Ad
Abnormally low levels of Ach and chAT, and upregulated levels of AchE were noted in the brains of mice with Ad in the present study, all of which were notably restored by IAB.
Ach, controlled by the terminating enzyme AchE and the synthesizing enzyme chAT (59), stimulates cholinergic function, and contributes to the storage and recovery of long-term memory
Under oxidative stress, increased levels of AchE promote the formation and deposition of Aβ plaques
Based on the findings of the present study, the protective role of IAB in the cholinergic system against Ad were proposed; however, the association between the cholinergic transmitter and Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress was not clearly elaborated.
This will be investigated in our ongoing research.
In conclusion, L-Glu-induced apoptosis of Pc12 cells, and Alcl 3 -and d-gal-induced Ad mice models were generated in the present study.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report of the neuroprotection of IAB, and this property, may be, at least partly, associated with the regulation of IAB on Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress.
The results provide insight for further study into the protective effects of IAB and its possibility of clinical application in Ad in the future.
