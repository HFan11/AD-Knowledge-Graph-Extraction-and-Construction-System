Amyloid β / PKC-dependent alterations in NMDA receptor composition are detected in early stages of Alzheimer´s disease
Amyloid beta (Aβ)-mediated synapse dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and previous studies suggest that NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysregulation may contribute to these pathological effects.
Although Aβ peptides impair NMDAR expression and activity, the mechanisms mediating these alterations in the early stages of AD are unclear.
Here, we observed that NMDAR subunit NR2B and PSD-95 levels were aberrantly upregulated and correlated with Aβ 42 load in human postsynaptic fractions of the prefrontal cortex in early stages of AD patients, as well as in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice.
Importantly, NR2B and PSD95 dysregulation was revealed by an increased expression of both proteins in Aβ-injected mouse hippocampi.
In cultured neurons, Aβ oligomers increased the NR2B-containing NMDAR density in neuronal membranes and the NMDA-induced intracellular Ca 2+ increase, in addition to colocalization in dendrites of NR2B subunit and PSD95.
Mechanistically, Aβ oligomers required integrin β1 to promote synaptic location and function of NR2B-containing NMDARs and PSD95 by phosphorylation through classic PKCs.
These results provide evidence that Aβ oligomers modify the contribution of NR2B to NMDAR composition and function in the early stages of AD through an integrin β1 and PKC-dependent pathway.
These data reveal a novel role of Aβ oligomers in synaptic dysfunction that may be relevant to early-stage AD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND
Aβ oligomers accumulate both in AD patients and animal model brain tissue
Aβ oligomers bind to receptors in order to activate particular aberrant cellular responses
NMDARs are ionotropic glutamate receptors that actively control synaptic plasticity and synapse formation, and are responsible for memory function, learning and formation of neuronal networks in the central nervous system (CNS)
Aβ peptides increase intracellular calcium and ROS production through NMDARdependent mechanisms
Additionally, channel properties of NMDARs are regulated by Protein Kinase C family members (PKCs), which phosphorylate NMDAR subunits in specific serine/threonine residues
Important molecular events in Aβ oligomer pathology are regulated by PKC signaling pathways
Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding PKCα were described in some families with inherited Alzheimer's disease, thus enhanced PKCα activity may contribute to synaptic deficits in AD
NMDA receptor surface trafficking and composition are developmentally regulated by extracellular matrix proteins requiring β1-containing integrin receptors
Moreover, synaptic integrins activate local protein kinases which phosphorylate and modulate NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDARs, enhancing NMDARmediated function in mature hippocampal synapses
Integrins are a large family of extracellular matrix receptors ubiquitously expressed and distributed and previous data pointed out them as candidates for Aβ peptide receptors in astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes
In this study, we first investigated early synaptic changes in human AD brains.
We found that, in fractions enriched in the postsynaptic density from AD patients, NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor and scaffolding protein PSD-95 were overexpressed in early stages of the disease and positively correlated with Aβ peptide load.
Accordingly, similar results were found in the 6month-old 3xTg-AD mouse hippocampi and in Aβ-injected mouse brains.
Finally, we demonstrated in vitro that Aβ oligomers differentially increased the NR2B-containing NMDAR and PSD-95 and enhanced NMDAR-dependent Ca 2+ influx by mechanisms involving NR2B subunit phosphorylation in an integrin β1 / PKC signaling pathways.
Overall, these results demonstrated that dysregulation of NMDARs in early stages of AD might be provoke by Aβ oligomers enhancing an aberrant calcium function by altered localization of NR2B-containing NMDARs in an integrin β1 and PKC-dependent manner.

RESULTS
NR2B subunit and PSD95 levels increase in postsynaptic density fractions of prefrontal cortex from early-stage AD patients and correlate with Aβ levels Reorganization and distribution of NMDA receptor subunits and postsynaptic protein PSD-95 occur in AD brains
To identify changes during the progression of disease, we analyzed the PSD and non-PSD enriched fraction of isolated synaptic terminals purified from the prefrontal cortex of twenty-six samples of nondemented controls n = 6 and AD brain patients, classified as AD-II n = 5, AD-III n = 4, AD-IV n = 4 and AD-V-VI n = 7 (supplementary Table
Western blot analysis of NR2B subunit (Fig.
Expression of both proteins decreased concomitantly from Braak II to Braak VI stages, which reveals a significant transient increase in the early stages of the disease, followed by a decrease during disease progression (Fig.
Accordingly, synaptophysin levels were also increased specifically in non-PSD fractions of Braak II stage AD brains when compared to controls and Braak V-VI (supplementary Fig
In addition, quantification of Aβ 42 by ELISA (n = 37 samples, supplementary Table
Importantly, Aβ 42 levels in PSD fractions ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 ng/mg protein and positively correlated with synaptic proteins in human samples (Fig.
However, when Aβ 42 levels exceeded 4.5 ng/mg protein, these correlations were lost, pointing out towards an Aβ 42 threshold concentration for NR2B and PSD95 upregulation.
Taken together, these data show a specific increase of NR2B subunit and PSD95 that correlates with Aβ 42 levels in the prefrontal cortex of brain samples at early stages of AD, which is counteracted along the progression of disease.
These important changes suggest a critical temporal dynamics of molecular reorganization of the synapse throughout the course of the disease that is dependent on Aβ 42 peptide.

Aβ peptide levels correlate with NR2B and PSD95 deregulation in the 3xTg-AD mice
To study molecular distribution and organization of NR2B, PSD95, synaptophysin, and Aβ 42 along synaptic deficit progression, we initially selected an age with no signs of pathology in the triple transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD) (1 month; Fig.
Isolated synaptosomes from the hippocampus were analyzed by ELISA and Western blot.
In 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, we observed a significant increase in NR2B subunit (Fig.
Notably, these data showed a robust correlation  between Aβ42 with NR2B (p = 0.036) and PSD95 (p = 0.011) (Fig.
As control, protein levels of 1-month old mouse showed similar expression in 3xTg-AD and WT mice (Supplementary Fig
Thereby, these results indicate that 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice show an enhanced expression of NR2B subunit, PSD-95 and synaptophysin proteins, which is associated with increased levels of Aβ42 peptides in isolated synaptic terminals of the hippocampus.

Aβ injection increases NR2B and PSD95 levels in adult mice hippocampus
To elucidate the biological effects of Aβ oligomers in NR2B and PSD95 protein expression, we injected Aβ oligomers or vehicle into the hippocampus of C57 adult mice.
Aβ injection led neurons to overexpress NR2B and PSD95 proteins in DG, as revealed by quantification of the immunolabeled area with synaptic markers NR2B (Fig.
vehicle-injected mice (n = 16 animals, in three experiments) and PSD-95 (Fig.
However, any change in NR2B and PSD95 expression was observed in CA1 and CA3 areas (Supplemental Figure
Overall, these histological findings demonstrate that Aβ oligomers trigger NR2B and PSD95 upregulation in DG of mouse hippocampus.
Aβ oligomers regulate NR2B-containing NMDA receptor density and related Ca 2+ response in neuronal membranes Cultured neurons were treated with 1μM Aβ for 30 min or 24 h, and cell surface receptor density was determined by cleavable biotinylation assay followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
As shown in Fig.
Conversely, longer Aβ treatment for 24 h reduced both NR2A and NR2B subunit localization at cellular surface (46.9 ± 16.6% and 53.2 ± 9.8%, respectively, compared with control vehicle-treated cells, 100%; Fig.
Neither acute nor chronic Aβ treatments exerted significant effect on the expression of NR2A or NR2B subunits in total cell lysates (Fig.
In addition, although Aβ treatment increased both cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) and the presence of NR2B in the neuronal membrane, excitotoxicity elicited by the NMDA posttreatment was not significantly affected with respect to untreated cells (Supplemental Figure
These results show that Aβ selectively modulates the membrane localization of NR2A and NR2B subunits in NMDA receptors of primary cortical neurons.
Next, [Ca 2+ ] cyt induced by NMDA was recorded in neurons pretreated with 1 μM Aβ for 30 min or 24 h.
Aβ-pretreatment for 30 min significantly enhanced the [Ca 2+ ] cyt after NMDA application, while chronic pretreatment with Aβ reduced the NMDAinduced Ca 2+ response compared to control (Fig.
Furthermore, NMDA-dependent [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase in the presence of 10 µM TCN-201, a NR2A specific inhibitor, revealed that contribution of NR2B to Ca 2+ accumulation was more prominent in Aβ-treated than in control cells, 4.7 ± 0,4 and 2.6 ± 0.4, quantified as area under the curve, respectively (Fig.
To selectively activate synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs, primary cortical neurons were treated with bicuculline and 4-AP to activate synaptic NMDARs, followed by MK801-induced blocking.
NMDA agonist selectively activated extrasynaptic NMDARs as shown in Fig.
Under these conditions, Aβ-treated neurons (n = 67 cells) showed specifically a significant increase in synaptic (11.5 ± 1.4 vs. 6.8 ± 0.4 a.u.) but not in extrasynaptic (7.2 ± 0.5 vs. 5.3 ± 0.3 a.u.) NMDA-evoked [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase compared to control (n = 63 cells) (Fig.
Overall, these results point out that soluble Aβ modify NMDARs-induced cytosolic Ca 2+ signals by modulating the function of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs on neuronal cell surface.
Aβ oligomers increase both synaptic expression and interaction of NMDA receptor subunit NR2B and postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 Next, we examined whether Aβ could modify NR2B incorporation at synaptosomal fractions.
NR2B subunit levels were significantly increased in Aβ-treated cells for 30 min (Fig.
Moreover, PSD-95 protein was also overexpressed in Aβ-treated neurons for 30 min (Fig.
To explore Aβ-induced modification on NR2B subunit and PSD-95 colocalization in dendrites, EGFP-NR2B subunit was overexpressed in cortical neurons and, after Aβ treatment for 30 min, extracellular region of NR2B subunit was labeled in in vivo conditions using anti EGFP antibody and subsequently stained with the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 (Fig.
Pearson's coefficient analysis showed that Aβ oligomers increased significantly NR2B/PSD95 colocalization compared to control cells (Fig.
Taking together, these results show that NR2B subunit and PSD95 synaptic expression and colocalization are early modulated by Aβ oligomers.
transfected in primary neurons.
First, basal PKC-mediated FRET signals were confirmed with PMA and Gö6983, PKC activator and inhibitor respectively (Fig.
Next, PKC activation by 1 μM Aβ oligomers was revealed by FRET signal in CKAR-transfected neurons pretreated with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (100 nM) for 10 min (Fig.
To confirm whether Aβ oligomers phosphorylate NMDARs by changes in PKC catalytic function by autophosphorylation
Accordingly, we found that 1 μM Aβ oligomers for 30 min significantly increased levels of phosphoPKC in total cell extracts from neurons (Fig.
5E, 4.3 ± 0.7 compared to control levels, 2.7 ± 0.2 a.u; normalized to total NR2B).
In addition, Gö6983 abolished the Aβ-induced phosphorylation of NR2B subunit in neurons (Fig.
Next, the role of PKC activity in NMDAR function was confirmed by an enhanced intracellular Ca 2+ influx to NMDA agonist in PMA pretreated neurons (Fig.
Similarly, intracellular Ca 2+ increase after NMDA addition in Aβ-pretreated neurons was significantly boosted when compared to control (Fig.
Finally, we analyzed whether PKC was involved in the Aβ-induced increase of NR2B subunit at synaptic sites.
Neurons were incubated with 1 μM Aβ for 30 min, with or without Gö6983, and synaptosomal fractions were analysed by Western blot.
As shown in Fig.
Altogether, these results indicated that Aβ oligomers control NR2B protein levels in synaptic sites through classic PKCs.

PKC activation by

Aβ oligomers upregulate NR2B subunit density via integrin β1/PKC signalling pathway
To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the Aβ/PKCmediated NR2B subunit modulation, we examined the possible involvement of integrin β1, previously described as a receptor for Aβ oligomers that induce synaptotoxicity and astrogliosis
First, the Aβ-induced PKC phophorylation (Fig.
Similarly, TS2-16, an integrin β1-activating antibody
Overall, these results indicated that PKC is phosphorylated by Aβ/integrin β1-dependent mechanisms.
Moreover, we confirmed the role of integrin β1 in the Aβ-mediated PKC activity by changes in FRET assays with CKAR reporter (Fig.
Thus, PKC activity was blocked when cells were preincubated with antiCD29, an integrin β1-inhibiting antibody
Taken together, these results confirmed that Aβ oligomers required integrin β1 to modulate PKC phosphorylation and activation.
We also studied whether changes on Ca 2+ permeability of NMDARs by Aβ oligomers was mediated by integrin β1 (Fig.
NMDARmediated intracellular Ca 2+ changes, quantified as area under the curve, in Aβ + IgM antibody-treated cells as control were significantly reduced in neurons exposed to Aβ along with CD29 antibody (Figs. 6D, 10.1 ± 0.9 vs. 7.5 ± 0.8, respectively).
Additionally, TS2-16 antibody-treated cells showed a higher Ca 2+ response to NMDA agonist than vehicle-treated cells (Fig.
These results confirmed that integrin β1 modulated Ca 2+ permeability of NMDARs.
Finally, we analysed NR2B density in functional synaptosomes of IgM+Aβ-and CD29 + Aβ-treated neurons.
Aβ induced an increase in NR2B density in IgM-treated cells (Fig.
These results suggest that soluble Aβ requires integrin β1/PKC pathway in order to mediate actively on NR2B localization and function in synaptosomes.

DISCUSSION
Excessive NMDAR activity causes excitotoxicity and promotes cell death, a potential mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in AD
Molecular mechanisms that control the location and function of the NMDAR channels in the progression of AD are still under study.
In the prefrontal cortex, senile plaques and neurofibrillary changes start to appear around Braak stage II.
However, some studies have demonstrated that the appearance of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in this area is preceded by changes in gene expression that point to increased synaptic activity and plasticity
Here, we observed an aberrant increased level of NR2B, PSD95, and synaptophysin in isolated synaptic terminals of AD prefrontal cortex samples at Braak II stages and of the hippocampus of 6-month-age 3xTg-AD mice.
These results reveal an early deregulation of synaptic NR2B subunit and PSD95 localization, which consequently would be associated with functional changes on synaptic transmission and/ or excitotoxicity.
Importantly, low range of Aβ 42 levels associated with PSD fractions in control, Braak II and III brains positively correlated with synaptic protein expression in human samples.
Although there are some fundamental discrepancies between human AD and mouse models, similar results were found in mouse brains.
Accordingly, we observed increased expression of NR2B and PSD95 in Aβ-injected mouse brains.
Mechanistically, we uncovered that Aβ oligomers required the adhesion protein integrin β1 to promote synaptic location and function of NR2Bcontaining NMDARs and postsynaptic PSD95 protein through classic PKCs.
These changes are induced by brief exposure to soluble Aβ oligomers since longer treatments reduced the NR2B location on the neuronal plasma membrane surface.
Further evidence will be needed to identify whether these findings are compensatory mechanisms observed in the early stages of AD

Early changes in synaptic terminals in AD brains
Since studies in post-mortem tissues have inherent limitations including looking at a snapshot of the final stage of the disease, analysis of samples with increasing AD neuropathology allows some novel insight into changes that may be occurring in synapses earlier in the degenerative process.
Levels of proteins involved in synaptic function decrease in late stages of AD brains including glutamate signaling
Nevertheless, there is little evidence about early changes of NMDAR subunits, PSD-95 and synaptophysin expression in AD.
Consistent with data reported here, previous study showed that protein levels of the NR1 and NR2B subunits increase at the early stages of the disease in the hippocampus, mainly in the granular cells of the dentate gyrus, while NR2A levels remain constant
Moreover, in AD brains, PSD-95 varies according to regions, increasing in the frontal cortex, at least in a primary stage, and decreasing in the temporal cortex
Moreover, in brain aging and particularly with AD initiation, Aβ oligomers may bind preferentially to postsynaptic regions, where PSD-95 is present, and even directly to the NMDA receptors, whereby mediate neuronal damage
Aβ oligomers can also trigger neurotoxic pathways via PSD-MAGUK proteins and enhance NMDAR activity by Fyn kinase phosphorylation of NR2B, with the obligate participation of PSD-95 and Tau proteins
Accordingly, we observed that NR2B, PSD95 and synaptophysin levels are higher in PSD and non-PSD fractions specifically in the prefrontal cortex in early AD (Braak stage II) but not in moderate to severe AD.
Notably the increased levels of these proteins correlated positively with Aβ 42 load of the synaptic terminal.
These findings raise the intriguing possibility that Aβ may initially cause an increase in synaptic and dendritic markers as a compensatory mechanism for the synaptic deficit, and this phenomenon, though transient, could be the biological basis of the period of mild cognitive impairment seen in AD
Detailed analysis of compensatory/adaptive capabilities of synaptic mechanisms might be a starting point for further discovery new approaches for early diagnostics and treatment of AD.
Aβ alters the distribution and function synaptic NR2B subunit and PSD-95.
Implications in AD Effects of Aβ on NMDAR subunits at mRNA and protein levels have been extensively studied both in vitro and in vivo.
Specifically, Aβ produces a rapid and persistent depression of NMDA-evoked currents and endocytosis of NMDA receptors in cortical neurons through mechanisms involving α-7 nicotinic receptor, protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) and the striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP 61 )
Additionally, STEP 61 protein levels are progressively increased in the cortex of Tg2576 mice over the first year, as well as in the prefrontal cortex of human AD brains
Here, our data support the novel notion of differential effects of soluble Aβ in synaptic NMDARs during the progression of the pathology.
In particular, we found that Aβ oligomers increased the presence and functionality of NR2B-but not NR2A-containing NMDARs in synaptosomes of cultured neurons without modifying the total levels of both subunits.
Disruption of this equilibrium has been linked to abnormal brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders such as AD and schizophrenia
Accordingly, NR2 subunits regulate pro-survival and pro-death signaling
Specifically, it has been proposed a model in which NR2A acts as a stabilizing force in the synapse, making both functional and structural changes more difficult, whereas NR2B controls the structural changes, such as new spine formation and spine retraction
Moreover, a change in the ratio of NR2A to NR2B affects subsequent NMDAR-dependent synaptic modifications.
Manipulations of the NR2A-to-NR2B ratio regulate both the magnitude and sign of subsequent plasticity, leading to a shift in the LTP and LTD.
In agreement with a critical role of NR2B in LTP, when the ratio of NR2A to NR2B increases, stronger stimulation is required to induce LTP, whereas a wider range of weaker stimulations can induce LTD
PSD95 promotes the insertion of new NMDARs, stabilizes receptors in the plasma membrane, and enhances channel opening rate
In parallel to the NR2B subunit increase, PSD-95 density was also increased in isolated synaptic terminals after a short Aβ treatment in neurons.
However, previous reports showed that Aβ peptide reduces total and synaptic PSD95 levels by inducing its degradation
Data could be different from those obtained in this work because the conformation of Aβ peptide used for neuronal treatments was mostly monomeric
This abnormal increase of NR2B-containing NMDARs and PSD-95 on synaptic terminals in the early stages of the AD could initiate functional changes on synaptic plasticity, intracellular Ca 2+ levels together with important structural changes on spines [27], and subsequently contribute to the aberrant synaptic function.
Integrin β1 and PKC in AD pathology PKC increases the number of functional NMDARs at the cell surface of oocytes and neurons and increases NMDAR channel opening rate
Our results showed that Aβ oligomers mediate PKC activation in order to modulate both NR2B expression and the rise of NMDA-induced [Ca 2+ ] cyt .
NR2B subunit phosphorylation at S 1303 enhances the NR1/NR2B receptor channel conductance and contributes to excitotoxic signaling
Here, our data describe that PKC phosphorylates NR2B subunit at S 1303 residue, suggesting that Aβ could regulate the NMDAR location as well as its activity in a PKC-dependent manner.
Furthermore, our results suggest that the increased cell surface location and dysfunction of NR2B-containing NMDARs could be explained by the abnormal increase of the colocalization of PSD-95 and phosphorylated NR2B subunit into the synaptic terminals.
Interaction between integrins and Aβ peptides promote spine and dendritic changes [27], synaptic dysfunction
We show that Aβ oligomers activate PKC and induce changes in NR2B phosphorylation, location, and NMDAR function through integrin β1.
In conclusion, we have deciphered a new molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunction, which highlights the integrin β1/ PKC/NMDAR signaling axis as an early event in AD.
We postulate that intermediaries in the signaling cascade described in this study can become promising biomarkers in AD progression and potential pharmacological targets to block the toxic program activated by β-amyloid peptide.
