A high‐fat diet exacerbates the Alzheimer's disease pathology in the hippocampus of the <i>App</i><i><sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup></i> knock‐in mouse model
Dementia is a syndrome that affects memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday activities (Ninomiya, 2019).
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major type of neurodegenerative dementia, accounting for more than 70% of all cases
AD is characterized by two well-known pathological hallmarks in the brain, the aggregation of β amyloid (Aβ) into plaques and the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles
It has been over 100 years since the
discovery of AD; however, its etiology is still not fully understood.
Genetic factors such as mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes only account for approximately 1% of AD cases, known as early-onset or familial AD (FAD).
In the majority of AD cases in which the onset is late or sporadic, aging is the main risk factor, and mounting epidemiological evidence has suggested that people with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or impaired glucose tolerance are at an increased risk for the development of
Pathological studies have also shown a significant association between T2DM-related factors and the neuropathology of AD, such as Aβ plaque formation
The etiology of cognitive dysfunction in AD patients with T2DM is probably multifactorial, but the mechanisms underpinning this association are not yet fully understood.
High-fat diet (HFD) treatment is an established method to induce T2DM in experimental animals and has been applied to many AD mouse models.
HFD treatment causes obesity and induces insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in both the periphery and brain
Studies with AD mouse models have generally been performed using transgenic mice to induce Aβ accumulation and deposition by overexpressing a mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgene, or with a combination of mutant APP and PSEN1 or MAPT transgenes.
Some studies with 3xTg-AD mice carrying mutant APP and MAPT transgenes together with a Psen1 knock-in mutation have shown that HFD treatment increases brain Aβ levels with an exacerbated cognitive decline
Other studies with 3xTg-AD mice found an exacerbated cognitive decline without alteration of the Aβ levels
Some studies with APP Swe / PS1 deltaE9 mice have also reported that HFD treatment increases the brain levels of Aβ with an exacerbated cognitive decline
Moreover, it has been reported that an HFD protects the blood-brain barrier in Tg2576 mice carrying the APP Swe transgene
Thus, there have been some controversies in the results obtained using transgenic AD mouse models.
These contrasting results may be attributed to artificial effects of the transgenes introduced, such as their overexpression and ectopic expression.
A recent study using a novel knock-in mouse model of AD, App NL/NL carrying the Swedish "NL" mutation, showed that chronic HFD treatment does not trigger AD-associated pathological alterations, such as hippocampal amyloidosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment, although mild impairments in both hippocampal long-term potentiation and social memory were observed
Despite carrying a FAD mutation, this mouse line does not spontaneously develop Aβ deposition.
Given the findings from transgenic mouse models of AD mice with HFD treatment, we hypothesized that prior Aβ deposition may be a prerequisite for HFD treatment to exacerbate the development or progression of AD.
It is reasonable to assume that T2DM has an impact on amyloidosis since Aβ deposition starts at 10-20 years before the clinical onset of AD
To test this hypothesis, we applied HFD treatment to an App NL-F/NL-F knock-in mouse model of AD, which carries a humanized β-amyloid (Aβ) sequence with two pathogenic mutations: Swedish "NL" and Iberian "F" at the authentic mouse App locus, thereby increasing the production of the pathogenic Aβ without the overproduction of APP.
App NL-F/NL-F mice accumulate Aβ plaques from 6 months of age and show very mild cognitive impairment at 18 months of age.
The present study provides the first experimental evidence demonstrating that T2DM exacerbates pre-existing AD pathology, and that AD pathology does not induce T2DM in regular diet (RD)-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice.

F I G U R E 1
A high-fat diet led to increased body weight, impaired glucose metabolism, and an impaired insulin signaling pathway in both wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice.
(a) Six-month-old wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice were fed either a regular (RD) or high-fat diet (HFD), and their weights were plotted every 4 weeks for a period of 24 weeks (solid line) and then at 58 and 78 weeks of age (dotted line).
(b) Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test at 18 months of age.
After 6 h of fasting, mice were injected with glucose (2 g/kg of body weight).

The results in (d-f) were statistically analyzed by a two-way ANOVA (p values for each analysis shown) followed by post hoc Tukey's HSD test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001

| RE SULTS

| An HFD altered the metabolic parameters and brain insulin signaling in both wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice
To examine whether or not App NL-F/NL-F mice respond to HFD treatment in a similar way to wild-type mice, wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F male mice were fed either an RD or an HFD for 12 months starting at 6 months (25 weeks) of age.
As shown in Figure
There were no phenotypical changes between the HFD-fed wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice, and their increased body weights were maintained throughout the experiment.
Both genotypes of mice fed an HFD exhibited a significantly lower intake of food and water in comparison with those fed an RD (Figure
To evaluate the effect of an HFD on their glucose metabolism, we measured the fasting blood glucose levels every other week up to 49 weeks of age.
As expected, HFD treatment significantly increased fasting blood glucose levels from the second week of treatment in both genotypes of mice (Figure
To examine whether HFD treatment induces a diabetic condition, mice were subjected to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) at 18 months of age.
As shown in Figure

Subsequently, we assessed the hippocampal insulin signaling by
Western blotting (Figure
Consistent with the peripheral glucose metabolism impairment, we found an increase in basal levels of IRS1 phosphorylation at Ser 632/635 , which negatively regulates the IRS1 function by reducing its association with PI3-kinase, in both wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD, while the basal level of IRS1 phosphorylation at Tyr 608 , which generates a docking site for the PI3-kinase, was slightly decreased only in the HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice, thereby significantly increasing the pIRS1 S632/635 /pIRS1 Y608 ratio (Figure
The total protein levels of insulin receptor β (INSRβ) and AKT were not significantly altered by the diet in either genotype, but the basal level of AKT phosphorylation at Ser 473 was significantly increased only in the HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice (Figure
The hyperphosphorylation of AKT is known to increase phosphorylation of serine residues of IRS1 through activation of mTOR pathway
These results suggest that HFD induces a more intense hippocampal insulin resistance in App NL-F/NL-F mice than in wild-type mice.

| An HFD impaired the cognitive function only in App NL-F/NL-F mice
We next examined whether HFD treatment impairs the cognitive function by performing a Morris water maze test at 18 months of age.
Mice were trained to find a hidden platform underwater for 11 consecutive days and then subjected to a probe test without a platform (Figure
During training, App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD showed a significantly increased (p < 0.0001) escape latency to the platform in comparison with all other groups, with significant effects of genotype, diet, and interaction between genotype and diet (Figure
During the probe test at 24 h after the last training, App NL-F/NL-F •HFD mice, but not the other three groups of mice, exhibited no preference for the target quadrant among all quadrants (Figure
Furthermore, the frequency of virtual platform crossing was decreased, and the time to the target quadrant was increased in App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD compared to all other groups; however, the differences did not reach statistical significance (Figure
The swimming speed did not differ markedly among the groups (Figure
Next, we examined the levels of pre-and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus by Western blotting (Figure
As shown in Figure
These results indicate that an HFD disturbs synaptic integrity only in App NL-F/NL-F mice.

| An HFD increased Aβ deposition in App NL-F/NL-F mice
We next assessed Aβ deposition by immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-Aβ (82E1) antibody (Figure
Quantification of the Aβ plaque-covered area revealed that App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD showed a significantly increased (more than twofold) Aβ plaquecovered area in the hippocampus in comparison with App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an RD (Figure
No plaques were found in the wild-type mice (Figure
It is noteworthy that in App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD, most of the plaques were located in the central zone of the hippocampus, namely in the area between the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) (Figure
We then compared the degree of the Aβ plaque coverage in 3 defined zones in the hippocampus, as shown in the schematic illustration in Figure
We found that in App NL-F/NL-F
•RD mice, the MSS exhibited the highest degree of Aβ plaque coverage (approximately 2%) among the three zones, and HFD treatment significantly and selectively increased it to approximately 6% (Figure
We then quantified the SDS-soluble (SDS sol.) and SDSinsoluble/formic acid-extractable (FA ext.)
Aβ present in the hippocampal protein fractions with a dot blot analysis using anti-Aβ (82E1) antibody (Figure
We found that App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD had a significantly (p = 0.009) higher amount of FA-extractable Aβ than App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an RD, while the levels of SDS-soluble Aβ were not affected by diet.
We also examined the phosphorylated Tau accumulation by immunohistochemistry using an anti-Tau (AT8) antibody.
No positive signal was detected in App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an RD or those fed an HFD (Figure
To clarify whether or not HFD treatment affects either APP processing or Aβ formation, we examined the levels of APP and APPderived fragments by Western blotting (Figure
App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD showed a significant decrease in full-length APP (FL-APP) detected by the anti-APP A4 (22C11) that recognizes Nterminal residues (a.a.
66-81) of APP.
Two other antibodies (6E10, APP-CT) also showed that an HFD caused a similar but not significant decrease in FL-APP in App NL-F/NL-F mice.
In contrast, an HFD slightly increased FL-APP in wild-type mice (Figure
Humanized Aβ detected by 6E10 was only found in App NL-F/NL-F mice with no diet effect (Figure
Accordingly, significantly higher levels of β secretase-cleaved CTFβ fragment were detected in App NL-F/NL-F mice than in wild-type mice, and they were slightly increased by an HFD (Figure
In contrast, slightly lower levels of α secretase-cleaved CTFα were detected in App NL-F/NL-F mice than in wild-type mice, with a slight decrease due to an HFD (Figure
These results suggest that APP processing by β secretase to generate Aβ may be slightly but not significantly enhanced by an HFD in App NL-F/NL-F mice.
Next, we examined the hippocampal gene expression profiles of all four groups of mice using a microarray analysis of hippocampal RNA and confirmed no significant difference in the expression of genes involved in APP processing and Aβ clearance (Table
Taken together, these results showed that an HFD did not significantly alter the APP processing or Aβ clearance in App NL-F/NL-F mice.

| An HFD increased the hippocampal expression of genes involved in glial activation in
App NL-F/NL-F mice Next, we compared the expression of specific marker genes for five major types of brain cells: astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, neural stem cells/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs), and neurons to assess the cell population changes caused by diet and genotype (Table
We observed an increased expression of markers related to microglial (C1qa, C1qb, and Cd68) and astrocytic (Gfap) activation in App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an RD or HFD and also in HFD-fed wild-type mice in comparison with RD-fed wild-type mice.
App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an HFD exhibited the highest expression of these genes, suggesting that an HFD exacerbates glial activation in the App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus, but has a limited effect in the wild-type hippocampus.
No differences were observed among the 4 groups in the expression of markers related to the three other cell types (neuron, NSC/NPC, and oligodendrocyte) (Table
To confirm the activated state of glial cells in hippocampus, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy of coronal brain sections using anti-CD68 antibody (Figure
A much stronger CD68 immunoreactivity (IR) was detected in the hippocampus of RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice than in that of RD-fed wild-type mice, and it was significantly increased by an HFD but only in the MSS zone of the App NL-F/NL-F mice (Figure
Furthermore, multiimmunofluorescence microscopy for Aβ and CD68 revealed that CD68-positive cells were mostly located surrounding Aβ plaques in App NL-F/NL-F mice (Figure
Western blotting of hippocampal extracts confirmed that an HFD significantly increased the levels of IL-1β in only App NL-F/NL-F mice compared to the RD-fed group (Figure
Relatively strong GFAP IR was detected in the MSS zone of both the wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus with a tendency to be increased compared with the former.
However, GFAP IR in the three zones of the hippocampus were not affected by diet in either genotype (Figure
In App NL-F/NL-F mice, GFAP-positive cells were mostly detected in areas surrounding Aβ plaques (Figure
These results are consistent with the microarray data and indicate that an HFD is associated with an increase in Aβ deposition accompanied by microglial activation in the MSS zone of the hippocampus in App NL-F/NL-F mice.

| An HFD increased nuclear accumulation of 8-oxoguannine and altered gene expression in the hippocampus of App NL-F/NL-F mice
Amyloid deposition and glial activation are known to induce oxidative stress, which causes the oxidation of various molecules, including DNA, resulting in cellular dysfunction
This mice fed an RD or HFD (Figure
We found that App NL-F/NL-F mice tended to show a reduced GCL volume in comparison with wildtype mice (Student's t test, p = 0.0484) and that HFD treatment also decreased the volume in both genotypes of mice to some extent.
As a result, HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice exhibited a significantly reduced GCL volume in comparison with RD-fed wild-type mice (2way ANOVA, Tukey's HSD post hoc test, p = 0.0151) (Figure
These findings were consistent with an exacerbated AD-like pathology in the HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice.
Of note, Fluoro-Jade C staining showed no sign of degenerating neurons in the hippocampus of any group (Figure
To evaluate the extent of oxidative stress in the hippocampus, we examined the accumulation of the oxidized guanine base 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) in brain sections from wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an RD or HFD using immunohistochemistry with anti-8-oxo-2´-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) antibody (Figure
We found a slightly higher 8-oxoG IR in the hippocampus of RDfed App NL-F/NL-F mice than in RD-fed wild-type mice, which was significantly increased by HFD treatment.
Quantification of 8-oxoG IR revealed that HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice exhibited the highest 8-oxoG IR in the three zones of the hippocampus among all groups (Figure
The 8-oxoG IR in the GCL and MSS of the HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus was significantly higher than the IR found in all other groups, but the value in CA1sp showed a significant increase only compared to RD-fed wild-type mice.
In addition, the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) modified proteins in hippocampus were examined by Western blotting to evaluate the extent of lipid peroxidation-related damage.
App NL-F/NL-F mice showed significantly increased levels of 4-HNE-modified proteins compared to wild-type mice, but the levels were not affected by HFD treatment in either genotype (Figure
Furthermore, the hippocampal expression of antioxidant genes was also not affected by either diet or genotype (Table
These results suggest that HFD treatment resulted in increased Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in the MSS and oxidative DNA damage in both the MSS and GCL of the hippocampus, thereby reducing the GCL volume.
To delineate the molecular effects of HFD treatment in the App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus, we compared the gene expression profiles of RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F and HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice.
As shown in the Table
We found that HFD treatment of App NL-F/NL-F mice tended to decrease the expression of Ttr, a gene encoding the amyloid binding protein transthyretin (TTR), to 15% or 19% of the levels seen in wild-type or RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice, respectively.
However, the change did not reach statistical significance.
As a result, we examined the levels of TTR in hippocampus by immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-TTR antibody.
As shown in Figure
Quantification of the TTR IR revealed that HFD treatment of App NL-F/NL-F mice significantly decreased the levels of TTR in both the GCL and the CA1sp zones but not in the MSS zone of the hippocampus (Figure
Quantification of the TTR IR in the cortex also revealed that HFD treatment decreased the cortical levels of TTR in App NL-F/NL-F mice (Figure
In addition, we examined the total hippocampal levels of TTR by Western blotting (Figure
We confirmed that HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice had the lowest level of hippocampal TTR among all groups, and that this level was significantly lower than in RD-fed or HFD-fed wild-type mice (Figure
Finally, multi-immunofluorescence microscopy for Aβ and TTR demonstrated the intracellular co-localization of Aβ and TTR in the GCL of RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice and its apparent reduction by HFD treatment (Figure

| DISCUSS ION
The major conclusion of the present study is that chronic HFD treatment caused obesity and impaired glucose tolerance (i.e., induced T2DM conditions) in both wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice, with only the latter exhibiting an impaired cognitive function accompanied by marked increases in both Aβ deposition and microgliosis as well as insulin resistance in the hippocampus.
Moreover, HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice exhibited a significant decrease in GCL volume in the DG and an increased accumulation of 8-oxoG in the nuclei of granule cells, indicating that HFD treatment increased oxidative stress in the App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus.
HFD treatment also decreased the expression of TTR, a known Aβ-binding protein, in App NL-F/NL-F mice but not wild-type mice, suggesting that decreased levels of TTR may be a cause of the increased Aβ deposition in the hippocampus of HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice.
It is likely that chronic HFD treatment increased oxidative DNA damage in the App NL-F/NL-F mouse brain, thereby aggravating the AD pathology through alteration of the gene expression.
In contrast, we found that chronic HFD treatment from 6 to 18 months of age does aggravate hippocampal AD pathology in male App NL-F/NL-F mice, with cognitive impairment in an MWM test.
In the aforementioned study, App NL/NL mice were fed an HFD containing 60% kcal from fat for 16 months.
In contrast, in our study, App NL-F/NL-F mice were fed an HFD containing 40% kcal from fat for 12 months.
In both cases, mice developed similar levels of metabolic syndrome or T2DM, namely increased body weight and fasting blood glucose levels, and impaired glucose tolerance.
Because in comparison with App NL/NL mice, App NL-F/NL-F mice have an additional Iberian "F" mutation in the App gene, which is known to increase Aβ42 production by altering the γ secretase processing of the C-terminal end of Aβ

pathogenesis of AD.
App NL/NL mice mostly produce humanized Aβ40, which is detected as both soluble and insoluble forms, due to the Swedish "NL" mutation being upstream of the β secretase processing site of Aβ.
However, they do not develop Aβ plaques at all
On the other hand, App NL-F/NL-F mice produce similar levels of humanized Aβ but dominantly Aβ42 (Aβ42/ Aβ40 > 5), and thus develop Aβ plaques in both the cortex and hippocampus
Taken together with the findings of previous studies, we conclude that T2DM does not trigger AD pathology but does exacerbate pre-existing AD pathology, at least Aβ plaque formation.
Moreover, our results indicate that AD pathology does not induce T2DM in RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice, which had been observed in transgenic models of AD.
It has been well-documented that an HFD or T2DM interfere with hippocampal functioning
We therefore examined HFD-induced alterations of AD pathology in the App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus.
The major alterations were markedly increased hippocampal Aβ deposition in App NL-F/NL-F mice, especially in the zone covering the upper part of the molecular layer of DG, the stratum lacunosum and stratum radiatum of CA1 (MSS), and increased microgliosis in the same zone.
The affected zone contains niches for synapses from the perforant path and the Schaffer collateral pathway in the hippocampal network; thus, it is pivotal for learning and memory
Although the levels of SDS-soluble Aβ remained unchanged in comparison with the RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus, the levels of SDS-insoluble and FA-extractable Aβ were increased twofold in the HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus.
The SDS-soluble fraction contains Aβ derived from the membrane-bound and cytosolic forms, while the insoluble fraction mostly contains plaque-associated Aβ
Because there was no significant change in APP processing toward Aβ formation, HFD treatment likely promoted Aβ aggregation and deposition by the suppression of its clearance.
This is consistent with a recent study reporting that HFD increased SDS-insoluble levels of Aβ in the cortex of a transgenic mouse line carrying the Swedish mutation, with a reduced Aβ clearance independent of insulin-degrading enzyme or neprilysin
Although soluble prefibrillar Aβ oligomers are classified as the most toxic species
It is likely that chronic HFD treatment increases the levels of toxic Aβ in the limited zone of the hippocampus, thereby exacerbating the AD pathology, such as plaque formation and microgliosis, as observed in HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice.
Gene expression profiling by a microarray analysis revealed that HFD treatment and App NL-F/NL-F mutation have a synergetic effect to activate the microglia in the hippocampus without significant changes in the expression of marker genes for neural stem/progenitor cells, neurons, and oligodendrocytes (Table
CD68-positive microglia were mainly detected in the MSS zone surrounding Aβ plaques in the HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus, as reported in
App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice with another toxic Arctic "G" mutation exhibiting more severe AD pathology
The levels of GFAP-positive astrocytes detected in the hippocampus of wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F mice did not differ to a statistically significant extent, with or without HFD treatment.
We found that HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice exhibited a significantly reduced GCL volume with much higher levels of 8-oxoG accumulation in the nuclei of the granule cells in the GCL in comparison with RD-fed mice.
The increased accumulation of 8-oxoG, a marker of oxidative stress, in the granule cells, and to a lesser extent in the CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species in these neurons is enhanced by the increased toxic Aβ accumulation or by the consequence of microgliosis; thus, it may cause hippocampal atrophy without cell death by affecting dendrites stability and architecture as previously reported
The granule cells in the GCL or pyramidal cells in the CA1 themselves are likely to produce toxic Aβ because the MSS zone, which contains niches for synapses to their dendrites, accumulates the highest levels of Aβ.
Moreover, we found that the expression of TTR in these neurons is significantly decreased in HFD-fed
App NL-F/NL-F mice in comparison with RD-fed mice.
TTR is a multifunctional protein that can bind Aβ peptide and suppress its aggregation, and which also promotes its clearance
It has been shown that the hemizygous deletion of the Ttr gene in APP Swe /PS1 deltaE9 mice results in accelerated Aβ deposition
These results strongly suggest that the decreased expression of TTR in the hippocampal neurons of HFD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice is one of the direct causes of the increased Aβ deposition.
We TTR is mainly expressed in the liver and choroid plexus and secreted into the blood or cerebrospinal fluid; furthermore, its levels are known to be decreased in AD patients in comparison with agematched controls
Recently, it has been shown that TTR is expressed in the neurons in the cortex or hippocampus in both humans and mice
The expression of TTR was reportedly altered in the brain of various mouse models of AD and closely associated with the level of oxidative stress
8-OxoG, or its repair reaction, is known to cause epigenetic alterations in the gene expression under oxidative conditions
We recently demonstrated that the increased accumulation of 8-oxoG in the granule cells in the GCL impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, thus inducing hippocampal atrophy and mild cognitive impairment in aged female mice
In the present study, we only examined male mice in order to avoid the strong effects of sex hormones or the estrus cycle; however, it is likely that female App NL-F/NL-F mice may exhibit a much higher susceptibility to HFD; thus, the AD pathology would be more strongly exacerbated because sex-dependent TTR modulation of brain Aβ levels or adult neurogenesis has been reported
Further studies are necessary to better understand the mechanism by which HFD treatment causes alterations in the gene expression, production, or clearance of the Aβ peptide, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses.
In particular, answering the question as to how T2DM affects the interaction of TTR and Aβ in the AD brain will help to establish new strategies for AD treatment.

| E XPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE S

| Experimental animals
Heterozygous App +/NL-F mice carrying a humanized Aβ sequence (G676R, F681Y, R684H), Swedish (KM670/671NL), and Beyreuther/ Iberian (I716F) mutations were previously established
Homozygous App NL-F/NL-F and wild-type mice were obtained by mating between heterozygous mice and were maintained as inbred lines.
Mice were maintained in an air-conditioned

| HFD treatment and metabolic assessment
To avoid strong effects of sex hormones or the estrus cycle in female mice, we used male App NL-F/NL-F and wild-type mice.
At 6 months of age (25 weeks), mice were individually housed and fed ad libitum with either an RD (CA-1, 13.8% of total calories from fat, Clea Japan

(d) Quantification of the Aβ plaque-covered area in 3 different zones of the hippocampus.
The Aβ plaque-covered area is shown as bar graphs.
(e) Aβ dot blotting of the SDS-soluble (SDS sol.) and formic acid-extractable (FA ext.) protein fractions of hippocampal tissue of App NL-F/NL-F mice fed an RD or HFD.
Three dots in each row were from the same sample, and the blot was reacted with anti-Aβ 82E1.
Wildtype•RD (WT•RD), Wild-type•HFD (WT•HFD), and Aβ peptide were used as controls.
No Aβ was detected in the wild-type samples.
(f) Quantification of the Aβ in the dot blot.
The values are relative to the integrated density of the dot blot observed in RD-fed App NL-F/NL-F mice.
The mean intensities were normalized to Ponceau S staining (SDS sol) or total protein (FA ext).
Data expressed as the mean ± SEM, n = 4 for all experiments.
Four brain slices per mouse were examined for (b) and (d).
The results were statistically analyzed by an unpaired t test, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001 raises a question as to whether an HFD increases oxidative stress and cellular damage in the App NL-F/NL-F hippocampus.
To examine the extent of cellular damage in the hippocampus, we performed cresyl violet staining of brain sections from wild-type and App NL-F/NL-F
