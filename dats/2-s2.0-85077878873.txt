Curcumin Ameliorates the Impaired Insulin Signaling Involved in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease in Rats
To date, dysregulation of the insulin signaling pathway in the brain has not been demonstrated unequivocally in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The purpose of the study was to examine the possible dysregulation of insulin signaling pathway in an AD rat model.
Furthermore, the present study investigated the effect of Donepezil and Curcumin on insulin signaling, insulin, and glucose levels in AD rat brain.
The rats were induced to develop AD by intraperitoneal administration of Scopolamine.
We found that glucose levels in plasma and brain were decreased in AD rats, whereas the insulin levels was increased in plasma but decreased in brain in AD rats.
In addition, insulin signaling proteins IR-␤, IGF-1, IRS-1, IRS-2 p-Akt (Ser473), and Akt were markedly reduced in the AD rats.
Furthermore, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels in the brain were markedly reduced in AD rats.
All these data were compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Curcumin significantly increased glucose levels in plasma and in brain.
However, insulin levels was decreased in plasma and was increased in AD rats' brain.
Moreover, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels were significantly increased in Curcumin-treated AD rats.
All these data were compared to Scopolamine-induced AD rats.
Thus amelioration of impaired insulin signaling and improved glucose regulation in AD rats by Curcumin may be beneficial in the management of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most devastating neurodegenerative disease among older people (≥65 years) that ultimately causes death of the affected individuals.
AD is a major global health problem that results in significant burden on the patients due to the high cost of managing AD
Neuropathologically, 60 T. Kanti Das / Insulin Signaling in the Pathogenesis of AD Defective glucose utilization
Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia is associated with higher risk of AD and decline in memory
Peripheral glucose metabolism is primarily regulated by insulin.
Therefore, hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance can affect insulin signaling that controls brain glucose metabolism and facilitates the neuronal development and functions in learning and memory
It is hypothesized that possible dysfunction of insulin signaling is linked with AD pathogenesis
Although, how the impaired insulin signaling contributes to the AD pathogenesis is not fully understood.
Numerous research groups
Scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, has been commonly used for the study of cognitive deficiency in experimental animals.
Intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of Scopolamine into animals causes blockage of the cholinergic neurotransmission that leads to cholinergic dysfunction and impaired cognition in animals
Scopolamine-induced dementia model is the most appropriate dementia model to reveal AD-related cognitive impairment profile
Donepezil, a wellknown pharmacological drug used for the treatment of AD, acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, reduces the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, and improves AD pathogenesis.
Throughout this study, Donepezil was used as a reference drug.
Curcumin, a natural compound derived from plant, is also known for its protective effect on AD pathogenesis.
It is known that Curcumin has various properties such as antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant, and scavenger of free radicals
Importantly, curcumin has also been shown to have beneficial effects in various neurodegenerative disease models
However, to date, there is very little information about any effects of Donepezil and Curcumin on insulin signaling, glucose, and insulin levels in AD rats.
Thus, in this study, we investigated the effects of Donepezil and Curcumin on the mediators of insulin signaling such as IR-␤, IGF-I, IRS-1/2, PI3K, p-Akt (Ser473), and Akt and also on the levels of key glucose transporters such as GLUT3 and GLUT4 in a rat model of sporadic AD, which was generated by i.p injection of Scopolamine.
In addition, the effects of Donepezil and Curcumin on glucose and insulin levels in both plasma and in the brain of AD rats were evaluated.
We found that glucose levels in plasma and brain were decreased in AD rats.
Whereas, the insulin levels was increased in plasma but decreased in brain in AD rats.
In addition, insulin signaling proteins IR-␤, IGF-1, IRS-1, IRS-2 p-Akt (Ser473), and Akt were markedly reduced in the AD rats.
Furthermore, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels in the brain were markedly reduced in AD rats.
All these data were compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Curcumin significantly increased glucose levels in plasma and in brain.
However, insulin levels was decreased in plasma and was increased in AD rat brain.
Moreover, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels were significantly increased in Curcumin-treated AD rats.
All these data were compared to Scopolamine-induced AD rats.

Animals
24 male Sprague Dawley rats aged 60-70 days and weighted 300 ± 20 g provided by PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, UBD were utilized.
The

Study design
The rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows; (a) Control (saline-treated), (b) Scopolamine-induced, (c) Scopolamine+Donepeziltreated, and (d) Scopolamine+Curcumin-treated.
Control group was administered with 0.9% saline (w/v) for 28 consecutive days.
Scopolamine (2.5 mg/kg), as a disease inducer, was administered to all the groups through i.p route.
The treatment groups were given Donepezil (5 mg/kg) and Curcumin (8 0 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days (Table
Although oral gavage was as invasive procedure, however we did not observe any signs of suffering in animal in the study.

Preparation of blood plasma
After 28 days of either Scopolamine or Saline treatment, rats were anesthetized using carbon dioxide in a closed chamber and then sacrificed by decapitation using guillotine.
5 ml blood was collected in anticoagulant heparin tube and it was fractionated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min.
Supernatants (plasma) were collected and stored frozen at -80 • C until further use.

Brain tissue preparation and processing
After 28 days of either Scopolamine or Saline treatment, rats were anesthetized using carbon dioxide in a closed chamber and then sacrificed by decapitation using guillotine, dissected and the brains were quickly collected and washed three times in chilled 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) (Bio-Rad).
Each group consists of six brains in which two brains were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the remaining four brains were used for immunoblotting.

Immunohistochemistry
Brains from each group were washed in 1X PBS, and were subsequently used in tissue processing.
Each brain from rat was cut into smaller pieces using a tissue slicer and then processed using an automated tissue processor (Leica ASP 300 S Tissue Processor, Leica Microsystem, USA), embedded in paraffin wax and then sectioned using a microtome (Medite, Medizintechnik, Germany) into 4-m thickness.
Brain sections from different groups of rats (n = 2 at each time point for each rat) were used for IHC using R.T.U Vectastain Universal Elite ® ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories).
Deparaffinised brain tissue sections were heat-induced using sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% tween 20, pH 6.0) and quenched with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, blocked with 2.5% normal horse serum.
Primary antibodies such as [IR-␤, p-Akt (Ser 473), Akt and GLUT4] were incubated at 4°C for whole night.
Subsequent procedure was done according to manufacturer's direction (Vector Universal elite ® ABC kits, Vector Laboratories).
Finally, tissues were counterstained with Hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted.
These sections were observed using a light microscope with lens objective 40x (Olympus, USA).

Brain homogenate preparation
The remaining four brains from each group were used for immunoblotting.
Each brain with known weight was snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in cell lysis buffer (1X) (Cell Signalling Technology) containing protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) at 3 pulses for 10 s each, with a 5 s interval on ice.
Tissue lysates were diluted 10-fold in 1X cell lysis buffer and were sonicated to ensure complete lysis.
The crude brain homogenates were stored at -80 • C and the protein concentrations were determined by using Pierce R BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Measurements of glucose and insulin levels
Glucose levels in plasma and in brain were measured using Amplex Red Glucose/glucose Oxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and the insulin concentrations were measured in plasma and in brain using ELISA (Cloud-Clone Corp) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.
Absorbance was measured at 560 nm and 450 nm (BioTek Instruments, USA) respectively.
Immunoblotting 50 g proteins were separated on 10-12.5% SDSpolyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA), blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 4-5% BSA in T-TBS, incubated at 4 • C overnight with respective primary antibodies, followed by incubation in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies.
Finally, the reactive protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence detection reagent (Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate, Bio-Rad) and signals were captured and visualized using VersaDoc Imaging system (Bio-Rad).
Pre-stained Precision Plus TM protein standards (Bio-Rad) was used to estimate the apparent molecular weight of the protein bands.
␤-actin was used as a control to ensure equal amount of protein loading.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed using SPSS 20.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
The post-hoc test were used after ANOVA analysis.
A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS

Lower levels of plasma glucose and brain glucose in AD rats and curcumin treatment significantly increased glucose levels
Glucose contents in the plasma were measured in all groups of rats and showed in Fig.
The glucose concentration in the plasma (n = 6) was 142.17 ± 2.58 mg/dL in Saline-treated control group and 111.77 ± 1.68 mg/dL in the Scopolamineinduced AD rats.
Donepezil-treatment in AD rats increased glucose levels to 126.04 ± 2.87 mg/dL compared to Scopolamine-induced AD rats.
Furthermore, Curcumin-treatment in AD rats also increased glucose concentration to 133.94 ± 2.81 mg/dL.
(Fig.
Taken together, it was found that the glucose levels was decreased 1.27-fold (p < 0.001) in the Scopolamine-induced AD rats compared to Salinetreated control rats.
Treatment with Donepezil and Curcumin in AD rats increased glucose levels by 1.13-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.2-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, compared to those in Scopolamine-induced AD rats.
Furthermore, glucose concentration in the brain was measured in all groups of rats.
Glucose concentration in the brain lysate was 515 ± 4.22 mg/g wet brain mass in the Saline-treated control group and 483.76 ± 9.69 mg/g wet brain mass in Scopolamineinduced AD group respectively.
In Donepezil-treated and Curcumin-treated AD rats, glucose concentration was found to be 503.02
± 5.10 mg/g wet brain mass and 506.32 ± 2.26 mg/g wet brain weight (Fig.
Taken together, it was found that glucose level was decreased 1.52-fold (p < 0.001) in Scopolamine-induced AD rats compared to Salinetreated control rats.
Treatment with Donepezil and Curcumin separately in AD rats increased glucose levels 1.04-fold (p < 0.01) and 1.4-fold (p < 0.001) respectively compared to those in Scopolamineinduced AD rats.

Higher levels of plasma insulin and lower levels of brain insulin in AD rat, curcumin treatment significantly reversed the insulin levels
Plasma insulin levels were measured in all groups of rats.
Insulin concentration was found to be 33.11
± 1.16 IU/mL in Saline-treated control group in comparison to 59.38 ± 3.56 IU/mL in Scopolamine-induced AD rats.
In Donepezil-treated AD rats, the insulin concentration was found to be 56.94 ± 0.44 IU/mL.
Interestingly, Curcumin treatment in AD rats markedly lowered insulin levels to 38.74 ± 0.44 IU/mL compared to Scopolaminetreated AD rats.
Thus, plasma insulin level was 1.79-fold higher (p < 0.001) in Scopolamine-induced AD rats compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Treatment with Donepezil and Curcumin separately in AD rats decreased insulin level 1.04-fold (p < 0.05) and 1.53-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, compared to those in Scopolamine-induced AD rats (Fig.
Furthermore, insulin levels in the brain were measured in all groups of rats.
The insulin level in the brain was 10.78 ± 1.64 ng/g wet brain mass and 7.08 ± 1.25 ng/g wet brain mass in Saline-treated and Scopolamine-induced AD rat group respectively.
In Donepezil-treated AD rats, the insulin level was at 8.3 ± 1.86 ng/g wet brain mass.
In addition, Curcumin-treatment in AD rats increased insulin levels to 9.53 ± 1.25 ng/g (Fig.
Therefore, it was found that insulin level was 1.52-fold (p < 0.01) decreased in AD rats compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Treatment with Donepezil and Curcumin separately in AD rats increased insulin level 1.17-fold (p < 0.01) and 1.42-fold (p < 0.05), respectively, compared to those in Scopolamine-induced AD rats.

Reduced number of immunostained cells positive for insulin signaling proteins and glucose transporter in AD rat brain and curcumin reversed the effects
Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of insulin signaling proteins and glucose transporter in the brain cortex of the rats.
There was a reduced number of the immunostained cells for (i) IR-␤, (ii) Akt, (iii) Phospho-Akt (Ser473), and (iv) GLUT4 in AD rats compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Treatment with either Donepezil or Curcumin increased numbers of positive insulin signaling proteins such as IR-␤, Akt, Phospho-Akt (Ser473), and GLUT4 immunopositive cells in AD rats (Fig.

Lowered levels of upstream insulin signaling proteins in AD rat brain and curcumin significantly reversed it
To examine the expression of major insulin receptor in the brain involved in insulin signaling pathway, we investigated the protein levels of insulin receptor ␤-subunit (IR-␤) (Fig.
We found a significant decrease in the levels of IR-␤ (0.72-fold, p < 0.001) in AD rats compared to the Saline-treated rats.
Densitometric analysis showed increased levels of IR-␤ in both Donepezil (1.06-fold, p = 0.074) and Curcumin-treated AD (1.25-fold, p < 0.001) rats upon treatment with separately Donepezil (1.06-fold, p = 0.074) and Curcumin (1.25-fold, p < 0.001) compared to Scopolamine-induced rats.
Furthermore, in AD rats, the IGF-1 level was decreased (0.62-fold, p < 0.001) compared to Saline-treated rats.
Donepezil and Curcumin treatment separately on AD rats decreased (0.78-fold, p < 0.01) and increased (1.14-Fig.
The numbers of immunopositive cells stained with IR-␤, Akt, p-Akt (Ser 473) and GLUT4 antibody were decreased in Scopolamineinduced AD rat brain and were increased in Donepezil-and Curcumin-treated AD rats.
The assay was performed in triplicate.

fold, p < 0.05) IGF-1 levels respectively compared to Scopolamine-induced AD rats (Fig.
We next investigated the expressions of insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS-1) (Fig.
It was found that the levels of IRS-1 (0.74-fold, p < 0.001) and IRS-2 (0.62-fold, p < 0.001) were decreased in AD rats compared to Saline-treated rats.
Donepezil treatment in AD rats lowered the levels of IRS-1 (0.77-fold, p < 0.001) and IRS-2 (0.82-fold, p < 0.01) respectively, as compared to Scopolamine-induced rats.
On the contrary, Curcumin treatment in AD rats augmented the levels of both IRS-1 (1.22-fold, p < 0.001) (Fig.

Reduced levels of downstream insulin signaling proteins in AD rat brain, curcumin significantly reversed it
We examined quantitatively the expression of p-PI3K (p85) (Fig.
In AD rats, the levels of p-PI3K (p85) was significantly decreased (0.59-fold, p < 0.001) compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Donepezil and Curcumin-treatment separately in AD rats increased p-PI3K (p85) levels (1.02-fold, p < 0.05 and 1.03-fold, p < 0.05), respectively, compared to Scopolamine-induced rats (Fig.
We further examined the levels of p-Akt (Ser473) (Fig.
In AD rats, the levels of p-Akt (Ser473) (0.57-fold, p < 0.001) and Akt (0.66fold, p < 0.001) levels were significantly decreased as compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Donepezil and Curcumin-treatment in AD rats increased levels of p-Akt (Ser473) (1.39-fold, p < 0.001), Akt (1.19fold, p < 0.001) and (1.41-fold, p < 0.001) (Fig.

Lowered levels of glucose transporters in AD rat brain, curcumin significantly reversed it
To investigate if there was any alteration in the levels of glucose transporters among various rat groups, we examined expression of the two key glucose transporters (GLUT3 and GLUT4) in the rat brains quantitatively using immunoblotting (Fig.
We observed that the levels of both GLUT3 (0.71fold, p < 0.001) (Fig.
Treatment of Donepezil in AD rats lowered GLUT3 levels (0.69-fold, p < 0.001); however, Curcumin treatment increased the GLUT3 expression (1.16-fold, p < 0.05) in AD rats (Fig.
In addition, GLUT4 levels in AD rats was significantly decreased (0.87fold, p < 0.001) compared to Saline-treated AD rats.
Donepezil and Curcumin treatment separately on AD rats increased GLUT4 levels (1.44-fold, p < 0.001 and 2.00-fold, p < 0.0010), respectively, compared to Scopolamine-induced rats (Fig.

DISCUSSION
Hypometabolism of glucose is one of the most important key factors in the AD brain and glucose metabolism is linked to insulin signaling pathway.
Therefore, impaired insulin signaling may have a pivotal role on impaired cognition such as in AD.
Insulin signaling plays important roles in regulation of metabolism of the brain glucose, neuronal development and activities which affect learning and memory
In our studies, we found that the glucose (Fig.
These observations indicated that hypometabolism of glucose; hyperinsulinemia and impairment of insulin signaling play roles in the development of AD
In brain, insulin/insulin growth factor (IGF-1) binds to the extracellular ␣-subunit of insulin and IGF-1 receptors (IRs/IGF-1Rs).
It induces a conformational change in the tyrosine kinase receptors and leads to the activation of tyrosine kinase that promotes autophosphorylation at several tyrosine residues of the ␤-subunit receptor inside the cell that results in the activation of downstream signaling pathway
From previous studies, it was found that lower expression of IRs and IGF-1Rs and IRS expressions progressed with AD
In addition, insulin/ IGF-1 signaling defects predominately decreased PI3K/Akt pathway-mediated GLUTs activation, and their reduced expression in AD brain may result in brain glucose hypometabolism
The decrease of IGF-I levels indicated that the insulin transport into the brain was impaired
In this study, we found that the levels of upstream insulin signaling molecules such as IR-␤ (0.72-fold, p < 0.001), IGF-1 (0.62-fold, p < 0.001), IRS-1 (0.74-fold, p < 0.001), IRS-2 (0.62-fold, p < 0.001), p-Akt (Ser473) (0.57fold, p < 0.001), and Akt (0.66-fold, p < 0.001) were markedly decreased in AD rats compared to Salinetreated control rats (Fig.
In addition, IHC study indicated that there was a significant decrease in the localization/and or expression of brain cells immunostained for IRS-1 and IRS-2 in AD neurons with signs of neurodegeneration.
Furthermore, previous study
In addition, previous study
Elevated expression of IRS-1 proteins in the brains was observed after spatial training in comparison to control
Importantly, in our studies, we observed reduced expression of IR-␤, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in AD rats that impaired insulin signaling cascade in AD rats.
Akt regulates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) survival signaling for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
Akt also has multiple phosphorylation sites and phosphorylation of Serine 473 (Ser473) in Akt allows full activation of Akt
In general, phosphorylation at Ser473 requires the activation of Akt and the levels of phosphorylation at Ser473 denotes the degree of Akt phosphorylation
The activation of Akt plays a beneficial role in neurodegenerative disease such as AD
In addition, a previous studies
In our studies, we observed a reduction in the localization of cells immunostained for Akt and pAkt (Ser473) in AD rats compared to Saline-treated control (Fig.
Previous study
We observed a significant reduction in expression of Akt (P < 0.001) and pAkt (Ser473) (p < 0.001) in AD rats compared to Saline-treated control rats.
Furthermore, a previous study reported that pAkt (Ser473) was significantly reduced in Scopolamineinduced animals
In contrast, another study reported an increased pAkt (Ser473) activity in AD brains
In addition, another study investigated the association of Akt expression and memory performance in Scopolamine-induced animals and they found that Akt expression in the brain was reduced resulting memory impairment
Akt had been found to be an important contributor in Scopolamine-induced memory impairment
In our studies, we also observed a reduced expression of Akt and p-Akt (Ser473) in AD rats that may lead to reduced spatial memory performance.
Furthermore, earlier study showed reduced repression of p-Akt in brain/neuron-specific insulin receptor knockout (NIRKO) mice
Interesting in our studies, the lowered expression of p-PI3K (p85) (p < 0.05), pAkt (Ser473) (p < 0.001), and Akt (p < 0.01) in AD rats were rescued markedly by Curcumintreatment (Fig.
It is known that Curcumin has anti-inflammatory property.
Neuroinflammation abrogates insulin signaling in the brain
It is possible that Curcumin can prevent inflammation in the AD rats and thereby improves insulin signaling.
In our study, due to the reduced levels of IR/IGF, IRS, PI3K, Akt, and pAkt (Ser473) proteins, insulin signaling was impaired in induced AD rats.
In addition, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels were also decreased in AD rats resulting reduced translocation of glucose transporters into the membrane.
Curcumin (blue arrow) rescued lowering of the levels of these signaling proteins and glucose transporters in AD rats.
Interestingly, in this study, we observed a greater effect of Curcumin as opposed to Donepezil, a reference drug used for the treatment of AD, in mediating an active insulin signaling in AD rats.
GLUT3 is a key neuronal glucose transporter in the brain and it has a higher affinity and more potential
Therefore it is believed that a higher GLUT3 expression might improve glucose uptake in the neuron
Previous studies showed that GLUT3 levels were decreased
Insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4
Furthermore in cells, there was a slow recycling of GLUT4 between the plasma membrane and the vesicular compartments in the absence of insulin
It was found that insulin stimulates glucose transport by translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular sites to the plasma membrane
Furthermore, a study using IHC found that, compared to other GLUTs such as GLUT3 and GLUT4 were predominantly expressed in the brain
Another study reported the association of IRSs/PI3K/Akt pathway with high expression of GLUT3, and GLUT4 translocation as well as their attachment to the plasma membrane
In this study, we observed a reduced localization of cells immunostained with GLUT4 in AD rats compared to Saline-treated control (Fig.
A study showed that GLUT4 knockout mice had impaired insulin signaling and developed insulin resistance, however the exact mechanism was unclear
It was also suggested that insulin signaling was impaired due to decreased expression of GLUT3 and GLUT4
In our study, we also observed that in conjunction with impaired insulin signaling, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels were reduced in AD rats.
Interestingly, Curcumin treatment in AD rat brain significantly improved insulin signaling and rescued the reduced expression of GLUT3 and GLUT4 (Fig.
In our study, we observed increased insulin levels in AD rats compared to control rats and Curcumin markedly lowered the insulin levels both in the plasma and in the brain.
Hyperinsulinemia was shown to be associated with AD pathogenesis in humans
In addition, lower levels of glucose were found in AD patients with significant cognition decline
In our study, glucose levels were decreased in AD rats compared to control rats and Curcumin significantly rescued the lowered glucose levels in AD rats that may lead to improved cognitive function.

Conclusion
Taken together in the present study we found downregulation of insulin signaling proteins and major glucose receptors in AD rats compared to the Saline-treated control rats.
Thus our in vivo studies strongly indicate that impaired insulin signaling and altered glucose regulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.
These abnormalities observed in Scopolamine-induced rats have been documented in patients with sporadic AD, thereby indicating a possible human relevance of our study.
Importantly, in this study, Curcumin has been found to ameliorate the altered insulin signaling in AD rats, reduce hyperinsulinemia, and improve glucose levels in AD rats.
Therefore, Curcumin, a natural compound derived from a plant, may provide a better treatment of AD patients compared to widely used pharmacological drugs such as Donepezil that may have side effects.
Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of action of Curcumin in the treatment of AD.
