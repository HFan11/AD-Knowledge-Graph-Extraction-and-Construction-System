Cinnamic acid activates PPARα to stimulate Lysosomal biogenesis and lower Amyloid plaque pathology in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model
The response of the lysosomes, the waste clearance machinery of the cell, to different environmental stimuli is coordinated by a gene network with a master regulator Transcription factor EB (TFEB) at the core.
Disruption of multiple facets of the lysosomal and autophagic network has been linked to various neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage disorders, making TFEB an attractive therapeutic target to rescue or augment lysosomal function under pathological scenario.
In this study, we demonstrate that cinnamic acid, a naturally occurring plant-based product, induces lysosomal biogenesis in mouse primary brain cells via upregulation of TFEB.
We delineate that cinnamic acid activates the nuclear hormone receptor PPARα to transcriptionally upregulate TFEB and stimulate lysosomal biogenesis.
Moreover, using in-silico and biochemical approaches we established that cinnamic acid serves as a potent ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα).
Finally, cinnamic acid treatment in male and female 5× Familial Alzheimer's disease (5XFAD) mice remarkably reduced cerebral amyloid-beta plaque burden and improved memory via PPARα.
Therefore, stimulation of lysosomal biogenesis by cinnamic acid may have therapeutic implications for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other lysosomal disorders originating from accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.

Introduction
Enhancement of cellular clearance pathways via induction of the lysosomal machinery has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for diseases originating from accumulation of toxic aggregates.
Lysosomes are the terminal degradative compartment for macromolecules received from the endocytic, autophagic, secretory and phagocytic pathways
Lysosomal functions under different physiological and pathological conditions are regulated by a central coordinator, TFEB, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
Indeed, mounting evidence has established the beneficial role of TFEB targeted lysosomal modulation in Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with a multifactorial pathophysiology, is diagnosed by progressive cognitive decline ultimately leading to dementia.
Two major neurological hallmarks, deposition of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) underline the pathogenesis of AD
Extracellular senile plaques are comprised of toxic aggregates of the protein amyloid-beta (Aβ), generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta and gamma secretases whereas abnormal hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau leads to intraneuronal accumulation of NFTs
Genetic mutations in the neuronal membrane protein APP and the component of the gamma secretase complex presenilins (PSEN1 and PSEN2), underlie the early-onset familial forms of the disease which constitute only 1-5% of all AD occurrences
However, the etiology of the more prevalent late-onset sporadic form of AD remains largely unknown posing challenges to the development of AD therapeutics.
Impaired clearance of Aβ has been implicated as a major causative agent in the widespread sporadic AD patients
Positive lysosomal modulation by Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (PADK) was shown to have protective effects by enhancing activity of cathepsin B, reducing Aβ accumulation and improving behavioral deficit in APP/ PS1 mice
Moreover, enhancement of astrocytic lysosomal biogenesis via virus-mediated TFEB overexpression has been demonstrated to facilitate Aβ uptake and its lysosomal degradation mitigating the amyloid pathogenesis
However, pharmacological compounds promoting Aβ clearance in AD are less explored and demands further studies.
Given the immense implications of lysosomal stimulation in countering the pathogenesis of AD, we examined whether cinnamic acid, a natural compound, can induce lysosomal biogenesis and thus have beneficial effects in an AD mouse model.
Cinnamic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid found ubiquitously in plant-based products.
The deamination of phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) yields cinnamic acid, which undergoes further enzymatic modifications to produce numerous phytochemical compounds including coumarins, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, phenyl-propanoids, and lignins.
Cinnamic acid and its bioactive metabolites are abundantly present in human diet including vegetables, fruits, honey and whole grains
Several studies have highlighted the role of cinnamic acid and its pharmacologically active derivatives as anti-microbial, antioxidant
Here, we delineate that cinnamic acid is a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and that cinnamic acid induces lysosomal biogenesis via PPARα.
We also demonstrate that cinnamic acid can attenuate the amyloid plaque pathology in 5XFAD mouse model in PPARα-dependent manner.

Barnes maze
Barnes maze test was performed as described previously
Briefly, mice were trained for two days on a 20-hole Barnes maze where only one tunnel contained colored food bait.
The mice were food deprived overnight prior to the training and test days.
During training, mouse was placed in the middle of the maze in a cylindrical 10 cm high start chamber.
After 10s, the cylinder was removed and the mouse was allowed to freely move and explore the maze and find the food baited tunnel.
The maze was well lit with high wattage light to generate sufficient light and heat to motivate the mouse to find and escape into the tunnel.
The tunnel was placed under the same hole and was stable within the spatial environment.
Following two days training, mice were given rest for one day and tested on the maze on day 4. On the test day, food-deprived mouse was placed in the middle of the maze and their performance was recorded using the Noldus system.

Results

Cinnamic acid stimulates lysosomal biogenesis in mouse primary brain cells
To begin with, we tested whether cinnamic acid could stimulate lysosomal biogenesis in mouse primary brain cells.
First, we examined the total lysosome content of the cell by selectively labeling the acidic lysosomal organelles using Lysotracker Red.
Cultured astrocytes were treated under serum free conditions with cinnamic acid for 24 h followed by staining with Lysotracker.
Cinnamic acid treatment resulted in marked increase in the lysosomal abundance in astrocytes (Fig.
We further explored the role of cinnamic acid in autophagy by electron microscopy and observed a profound upregulation in the number of autophagic vesicles of different stages (Fig.
To confirm this, we analyzed the expression of autophagy marker LC3B and observed that cinnamic acid (100 and 200 μM) remarkably enhanced the autophagic flux (LC3BII/LC3BI) in primary astrocytes (Fig.
Next, we treated the astrocytes with different doses of cinnamic acid (50, 100 and 200 μM) and checked the expression of various lysosomal markers by quantitative real time PCR.
Data showed that cinnamic acid upregulated the mRNA levels of the genes encoding lysosomal membrane proteins (LAMP2, LIMP2, NPC1) in a dose dependent manner (Fig.
This was accompanied by a similar pattern of increase in the LAMP2 protein levels demonstrated by western blot analysis (Fig.
We next performed a time point analysis using 100 μM cinnamic acid in cultured astrocytes and observed that cinnamic acid was able to upregulate the LAMP2 mRNA in a time dependent fashion (Fig.
We further checked the expression of LAMP2 in cultured primary cortical neurons by immunohistochemistry. LAMP2 expression was markedly enhanced following cinnamic acid treatment in cortical neurons (Fig.
We further explored the effect of cinnamic acid on expression and activity of lysosomal enzymes tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1), a lysosomal protease that destabilizes β-sheet region of amyloid-β and cathepsin B, a cysteine protease that degrades amyloid-β and hence is beneficial for AD.
Our data showed that cinnamic acid significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of Cln2, the gene encoding TPP1, in dose dependent and time course analysis (Fig.
Induction of TPP1 by cinnamic acid was almost similar to that by gemfibrozil, a known activator of PPARα
Interestingly, the activity of both TPP1 and Cathepsin B were augmented with different doses of cinnamic acid treatment indicating enhanced lysosomal functionality (Fig.
Together, our results reveal that cinnamic acid induces lysosomal biogenesis in mouse primary brain cells.

Cinnamic acid activates the nuclear receptor PPARα
After establishing that cinnamic acid induces lysosomal biogenesis, we intended to explore the upstream mechanisms.
TFEB is known as the central regulator of lysosomal biogenesis.
Interestingly, the Tfeb promoter harbors a PPRE (peroxisomal proliferator response element), binding site for the transcription factors PPAR (Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) 480 base pair upstream of transcription start site, which led us to investigate the involvement of the PPARs in the process.
Importantly, previously activation of PPARα by its agonist gemfibrozil has been shown to transcriptionally upregulate Tfeb and induce lysosomal biogenesis
Hence, we tested our hypothesis that cinnamic acid activates the transcription factor PPARα to stimulate TFEB.
To establish this, we first checked the effect of cinnamic acid on nuclear translocation of PPARα in WT primary astrocytes.
Data showed that 30 mins and 60 mins treatment with 100 μM cinnamic acid markedly increases the nuclear and perinuclear localization of PPARα (Fig.
We further analyzed the activation status of different PPARs following cinnamic acid treatment.
Cultured primary astrocytes isolated from WT, PPARα-/-and PPARβ-/mice were transfected with the pPPRE-luciferase construct for 24 h prior to cinnamic acid treatment (50, 100, 200 μM) for 6 h.
Cinnamic acid markedly induced PPRE-driven luciferase activity in WT, PPARβ-/-, but not in PPARα-/-astrocytes, suggesting that cinnamic acid specifically activates PPARα and not PPARβ (Fig.
To examine the role of PPARγ, we treated primary WT astrocytes with PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (2, 5, 10 nM) followed by treatment with 100uM cinnamic acid and observed that under PPARγ-inhibited conditions, cinnamic acid was still able to induce PPRE luciferase activity confirming that cinnamic acid does not require PPARγ (Fig.
Together, our data indicate that cinnamic acid activates PPARα.

Cinnamic acid is a potent ligand of PPARα
Next, we wanted to study the mechanisms how cinnamic acid activates PPARα and whether cinnamic acid could serve as a ligand of PPARα.
Crystal structure of mouse PPARα is unavailable.
Therefore, first we constructed three-dimensional structure of mouse PPARα with the help of online homology modeling tool of Swiss-model server considering human PPARα (PDB ID: 1KKQ) as a template.
After that, we applied Swissdock, a rigid body protein-ligand docking tool, to explore the interaction between cinnamic acid and ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPARα at a molecular level.
Based on electrostatic (Etot) and desolvation (Esol) energies, fifty different structures were predicted.
The most stabledocked structure was displayed with Chimera software.
According to this analysis, we found that cinnamic acid docked in the interface of LBD of PPARα as shown in (Fig.
The detailed view of that docking clearly indicated that cinnamic acid formed a strong hydrogen bond with Tyr314 residue of PPARα LBD at a distance of 1.988 A° (Fig.
However, our in silico study needs to be supported with experimental evidences.
Therefore, to validate the interaction between PPARα and cinnamic acid, we performed a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer or FRET assay as described earlier
Accordingly, our FRET analyses (Fig.
The binding curve resulted EC 50 value of 5.08 μM with Hill slope of 12.89.
To further confirm, we performed thermal shift melting analyses of PPARα protein with 5 μM of cinnamic acid.
Briefly, full length PPARα protein (flPPARα) was synthesized from HEK293FT cells transduced with lentiviral full-length PPARα.
After that, its melting profile was monitored with the help of SYBR green reaction strategy at a range of 27 degree to 94 degree Celsius.
The typical sigmoidal melting curve with melting temperature (Tm) of 56.19 °C clearly indicated that our in-house recombinant PPARα protein is conformationally stable.
Our melting assay revealed that 5 μM of cinnamic acid strongly shifted the melting curve of PPARα to 61.8 °C with a difference of 5.95 °C (< 5 °C) (Fig.

Activation of PPARα by cinnamic acid transcriptionally regulates Tfeb
Next, we analyzed the effect of cinnamic acid-mediated PPARα activation on the transcription of Tfeb.
We transfected WT astrocytes with either pTFEB(WT), a construct containing the PPRE site on the Tfeb promoter or pTFEB(Mu), a construct with mutated PPRE sequence (Fig.
Different doses of cinnamic acid treatment (50, 100, 200 μM) showed robust induction of Wild type TFEB-driven luciferase activity, however a marked reduction was observed in the mutated TFEB-driven luciferase activity suggesting that cinnamic acid requires PPARα to transcriptionally upregulate Tfeb (Fig.
When activated, PPARα is known to translocate into the nucleus and assemble a transcriptional complex that promotes transcription of the target gene.
Therefore, we checked the recruitment of different PPARs and basal transcription apparatus to the Tfeb promoter following cinnamic acid treatment by performing Chromatin immunoprecipitation.
Semi quantitative PCR and real-time PCR data revealed that cinnamic acid treatment in the WT astrocytes resulted in specific recruitment of PPARα, RNA polymerase and coactivator CBP to the Tfeb promoter (Fig.
Together, our data demonstrate that cinnamic acid transcriptionally upregulates Tfeb expression via PPARα.

Cinnamic acid enhances TFEB expression in primary brain cells
We next explored whether cinnamic acid induces the expression of TFEB, which can transcriptionally upregulate various lysosomal genes and facilitate the lysosomal clearance machinery.
We treated cultured astrocytes with different doses (50, 100, 200uM) of cinnamic acid and analyzed the mRNA expression by quantitative real time PCR.
Cinnamic acid was able to significantly induce TFEB expression and it was found to be dose dependent (Fig.
Time point analysis demonstrated that TFEB could be induced earlier than LAMP2, at 2 h, suggesting that TFEB is upstream of other lysosomal genes and cinnamic acid could induce lysosomal biogenesis via upregulation of TFEB (Fig.
We next checked the expression of TFEB by immunocytochemistry in primary astrocytes and cortical neurons and observed that TFEB expression was markedly increased with cinnamic acid treatment (Fig.
Collectively, these results suggest that cinnamic acid stimulates the master regulator TFEB to induce lysosomal biogenesis in primary brain cells.

Cinnamic acid stimulates lysosomal biogenesis via PPARα
To further ascertain the role of PPARα in cinnamic acid mediated lysosomal biogenesis, we analyzed the lysosome content and different lysosomal markers under WT, Ppara-null and Pparb-null conditions.
Primary astrocytes were isolated from WT, Ppara-null and Pparb null mice and cultured astrocytes were treated under serum free conditions with cinnamic acid for 24 h.
We first checked the total lysosome content by staining live cells with LysotrackerRed followed by quantification of the lysosome number per cell.
Data showed that cinnamic acid markedly augmented the abundance of acidic lysosomes in WT and Pparbnull, but not in Ppara-null astrocytes (Fig.
This was further confirmed by a similar pattern of result in the expression of lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that cinnamic acid, at 100 and 200 μM doses, upregulated LAMP2 expression in WT and Pparb-null astrocytes but did not have any such effect in case of Ppara-null astrocytes (Fig.
Finally, we analyzed the expression level of TFEB in these cells and observed an enhancement in TFEB expression in WT and Pparb-null astrocytes following treatment with cinnamic acid, however no such effect was observed in Ppara-null astrocytes.
Taken together, our results establish a specific involvement of PPARα and indicate that cinnamic acid particularly requires PPARα for stimulating lysosomal biogenesis.

Cinnamic acid increases lysosomal markers in vivo in 5XFAD mice
Following in vitro demonstration of stimulation of lysosomal biogenesis by cinnamic acid, we next intended to explore the effect of cinnamic acid on lysosomal markers in vivo in the 5XFAD model of AD.
Following oral administration of cinnamic acid for one month, we examined the levels of TFEB, the central coordinator of the lysosomal system, in different regions of the hippocampus, the most affected brain region in AD, and the cortex.
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of astrocyte specific lysosomal stimulation in facilitating the clearance leading to attenuation of pathology in AD model
Indeed, astrocytes can uptake Aβ via cell surface receptors and target it for efficacious lysosomal degradation
Hence, in order to analyze the astrocytic lysosomal biogenesis following cinnamic acid treatment, we performed co labeling of free floating hippocampal sections with TFEB and GFAP, a marker of astrocytes.
We observed that cinnamic acid treated mice had distinctly enhanced TFEB levels in the CA1 and Dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus (Fig.
Parallel to this, a marked upregulation in the TFEB expression in the cortex of the cinnamic acid treated mice was observed (Fig.
We also analyzed the activity of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B, an Aβ-degrading cysteine protease, following cinnamic acid treatment.
We observed that cinnamic acid treatment was able to significantly upregulate cathepsin B activity in the cortex of 5×FAD mice (Fig.
Next, we examined the activity of another lysosomal protease, TPP1, which destabilizes Aβ.
We found that following cinnamic acid treatment, the activity of TPP1 was significantly upregulated in the cortex of these mice (Fig.
Together, these results establish that cinnamic acid induces the expression of TFEB and stimulates lysosomal proteolysis in 5×FAD mice.

Oral administration of cinnamic acid attenuates amyloid plaque load in 5×FAD mice
Next we evaluated the efficacy of cinnamic acid mediated lysosomal induction on the amyloid plaque pathology in the 5×FAD mice.
The 5×FAD mice harbors five familial mutations linked to AD in APP and PS1 and develop amyloid deposition starting at two months of age
Growing evidence have documented a beneficial role of exogenous TFEB induction in promoting lysosomal degradation of Aβ and APP leading to attenuation of pathology
We treated six month old 5×FAD mice with cinnamic acid (100 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) followed by monitoring the amyloid beta levels in the hippocampus and cortex.
As expected, immunoblot analysis of hippocampal homogenate using the 6E10 Aβ monoclonal antibody revealed a robust induction of Aβ and the β-CTF fragment in the transgenic (Tg) mice compared to the non transgenic (Non-Tg).
Interestingly, cinnamic acid was able to remarkably reduce the levels of Aβ along with a parallel decrease in βCTF, whereas vehicle treatment did not show any such effect (Fig.
We further performed diaminobenzidine staining of hippocampal sections using 6E10 antibody and observed a marked decrease in the Aβ accumulation in the hippocampus of the cinnamic acid treated group compared to the Tg and vehicle groups (fig.
Next, we analyzed the plaque deposition in these mice by colabeling hippocampal sections with thioflavin-S, a dye that detects the β-sheet region of amyloid plaques and Aβ 6E10 monoclonal antibody.
Similar to our previous results, cinnamic acid treatment significantly reduced the thio-S positive Aβ plaques in CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (fig.
Collectively, our results demonstrate that cinnamic acid lowers the amyloid plaque burden in the brain of 5×FAD mice.

Cinnamic acid lowers amyloid plaque burden through PPARα
Having demonstrated that cinnamic acid activates PPARα, we examined whether it is the underlying mechanism of cinnamic acid's amyloid attenuating effects.
To explore the role of PPARα, we analyzed the effect of cinnamic acid on amyloid pathology of 5×FAD mice null for PPARα (5×/Ppara -/-).
After one month oral administration of cinnamic acid, we first checked the Aβ levels in the hippocampal homogenates of the 5×FAD and 5×/Ppara -/- mice.
As expected, cinnamic acid significantly reduced the Aβ levels in the 5×FAD mice compared to the vehicle group.
However, cinnamic acid failed to decrease the Aβ levels in the 5×/Ppara -/-mice indicating that cinnamic acid requires PPARα to exhibit its amyloid lowering effects (Fig.
It is noteworthy that the vehicle treated 5×/Ppara -/-mice presents significantly more Aβ levels compared to the 5×FAD mice, suggesting that ablation of PPARα contributes to the amyloid pathogenesis.
Diaminobenzidine staining using Aβ 6E10 antibody also revealed a similar pattern of results with cinnamic acid markedly lowering the Aβ deposition in 5×FAD mice, but not having such effect in the 5×/Ppara -/- mice (Fig.
Colabeling of hippocampal sections with thioflavin-S and Aβ showed that cinnamic acid reduced the thio-S positive amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of 5XFAD mice but was unable to do so in the 5X/Ppara -/-mice (Fig.
Taken together, these results suggest that cinnamic acid reduces amyloid plaque deposition in a PPARα dependent manner.

Cinnamic acid improves behavioral deficit in 5XFAD mice via PPARα
Finally, we analyzed the effect of cinnamic acid on the behavioral performance of the 5XFAD and 5X/Ppara -/-mice.
The 5XFAD model successfully recapitulates memory deficit which is one of the main AD characteristics.
We performed Barnes maze to test the spatial memory of the mice following cinnamic acid treatment.
Our data showed that cinnamic acid treated 5XFAD mice performed better as they took significantly less time to reach the goal box (latency) and made fewer errors compared to the vehicle treated 5XFAD mice indicating that cinnamic acid improves the memory of 5XFAD mice (Fig.
However, cinnamic acid treatment did not have any effect on memory deficit of the 5X/Ppara -/- mice suggesting that memory enhancing effect of cinnamic acid is dependent on PPARα (Fig.
Next, we performed T-maze to further assess the memory of these mice.
We observed that cinnamic acid-treated 5XFAD mice made significantly more number of positive turns and fewer negative turns compared to the vehicle treated 5XFAD mice (Fig.
We also examined the general locomotor activity of these mice in the open field test which showed no significant differences in the velocity, total distance traveled and cumulative movement duration of different cohorts of mice (Fig.
Together, our results demonstrate that cinnamic acid improves memory of 5XFAD mice via PPARα.

Discussion
At present there is no cure to halt or prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease and the available treatments only provide transient symptomatic relief.
Although AD is a multifactorial disease with several features contributing to the pathophysiology, according to the widely recognized amyloid cascade hypothesis, accumulation of Aβ due to an imbalance between its production and clearance is the primary event that initiates and drives AD
Therefore, lowering the cerebral amyloid plaque burden has immense therapeutic potential for treatment of AD.
In this study, we demonstrate that cinnamic acid, a naturally occurring plant-based product, can attenuate amyloid pathology in the brain of 5XFAD mice.
We also delineate a mechanism, induction of lysosomal biogenesis and thus cellular clearance, by which cinnamic acid could exhibit its amyloid-lowering effects.
Finally, cinnamic acid treatment also improves the memory and behavioral performance of 5XFAD mice.
Hence, cinnamic acid might be beneficial in countering the toxic protein accumulation observed in AD as well as other neurodegenerative disorders and LSDs.
While exploring the mechanism underlying cinnamic acid-mediated lysosomal biogenesis, we observed that cinnamic acid specifically activates PPARα, a class of nuclear hormone receptors that act as lipid sensors
Previously, we have demonstrated a role of PPARα in stimulating lysosomal biogenesis
PPARs are ligand-inducible transcription factors with multiple functional domains: a highly conserved, zinc finger containing DNA binding domain, a hinge region, C-terminal ligand binding domain, the E/F domain for dimerization and transactivation of the receptor and N-terminal domain for ligand-independent regulation.
They form heterodimers with retinoid-X-receptors (RXRs) and bind to specific PPRE on the promoter of the target genes to regulate gene expression
The α isoform of these receptors, PPARα is primary involved in regulation of energy homeostasis
Multiple evidence in this study indicate that cinnamic acid activates PPARα to induce lysosomal biogenesis.
Firstly, cinnamic acid treatment results in nuclear translocation of PPARα in primary astrocytes.
Secondly, cinnamic acid stimulates PPRE luciferase activity in WT and PPARβ -/-, but not in PPARα -/-, astrocytes.
Thirdly, cinnamic acid promotes the recruitment of specifically PPARα, but neither PPARβ nor PPARγ, to the Tfeb promoter.
Finally, cinnamic acid stimulates lysosomal abundance in PPARαdependent manner.
Next, we examined how cinnamic acid could activate PPARα.
Interestingly, using in-silico and biochemical approaches, we observed that cinnamic acid could bind to the ligand binding domain of PPARα.
Hence, here, for the first time, we established that cinnamic acid might serve as a ligand of PPARα.
Our In-silico docking analysis revealed that cinnamic strongly interacted with a tyrosine residue (Y314) of PPARα.
Consistently, TR-FRET analysis and Thermal shift assay further demonstrated that cinnamic acid indeed is a very strong agonist/ligand of PPARα.
Therefore, our study establishes that cinnamic acid binds to and activates PPARα.
We further explored the downstream targets of cinnamic acid-mediated PPARα activation which could promote lysosomal biogenesis.
Growing evidence has shed light on the mechanisms of lysosomal biogenesis.
Lysosomal response to different environmental stimulus is coordinated by the central regulator, TFEB and the regulatory lysosomal gene network CLEAR (coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation)
TFEB is a MiT family transcription factor that binds to the CLEAR sequence present on multiple lysosomal genes and thereby positively regulates gene expression, lysosomal abundance and degradation of lysosomal substrates
Interestingly, the Tfeb promoter harbors a PPAR-response element (PPRE) and activation of PPARα by its agonist Gemfibrozil leads to transcriptional upregulation of TFEB and stimulates lysosomal biogenesis
In this study, we show that cinnamic acid transcriptionally enhances TFEB expression and induces lysosomal biogenesis via PPARα.
Moreover, oral administration of cinnamic acid upregulates TFEB levels in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.
Several studies have documented a beneficial role of TFEB induction in animal models of AD and tauopathy.
Targeted TFEB expression in the astrocytes was shown to enhance lysosomal biogenesis and promote uptake and degradation of Aβ leading to attenuation of amyloid pathology
In addition to that, activation of TFEB in the neurons facilitates lysosomal degradation of holo-APP and thereby reduces Aβ generation and amyloid plaque pathology in APP/PS1 mice
In another study, inhibition of Glycogen kinase 3β (GSK3β) caused lysosomal biogenesis via nuclear translocation of TFEB and promoted lysosomal degradation of APP
Moreover, in an AD mouse model demonstrating tauopathy, TFEB was shown to effectively reduce NFT pathology along with improvement of behavioral deficit and neurodegeneration
Besides AD, disruption of multiple facets of the lysosomal and autophagic network has identified aberrant lysosomal function as a common underlying mechanism of various neurodegenerative diseases.
Therefore stimulation of TFEB to rescue or augment lysosomal function has been widely explored as a therapeutic strategy
Accumulated evidence has reported that in cellular and mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD), overexpression or pharmacological activation of TFEB improved lysosomal function and ameliorated α-synuclein aggregate mediated neurotoxicity
Overexpression of TFEB was shown to protect dopaminergic neurons by promoting α-synuclein clearance
Moreover, genetic and chemical activation of TFEB facilitated autophagosome clearance and reduced cell death in a MPTP mouse model
In addition, in cellular and different animal models of Huntington's disease (HD), multiple studies have revealed the efficacy of augmenting the lysosomal function and autophagy in countering the disease pathogenesis.
Overexpression of TFEB in cultured cells was observed to induce lysosomal biogenesis and increase degradation of pathogenic huntingtin proteins
Importantly, in a mouse model of HD, TFEB activation by PGC-1α facilitated huntingtin aggregate clearance
Given the ability of TFEB to effectively coordinate lysosomal biogenesis with autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis, stimulation of TFEB has enormous therapeutic potential for various Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs).
TFEB has been established as a specific modulator of lysosomal proteostasis in Gaucher disease and Tay-Sachs disease, LSDs characterized by deficient activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase and hexosaminidase-A respectively
Moreover, in case of Pompe disease, characterized by dysfunctional autophagy and lysosomal abnormality, overexpression of TFEB was shown to reduce lysosomal size and improve overall autophagy by inducing exocytosis of the autophagolysosomes in cellular as well as mouse model
Furthermore, in cystinosis, caused by accumulation of cystine in lysosomes, TFEB overexpression or stimulation of TFEB by genistein lowered the cystine levels and rescued the abnormalities of lysosomal compartments
Therefore, TFEB induction is an attractive therapeutic strategy to augment lysosomal function under pathological conditions and stimulation of TFEB and lysosomal biogenesis by cinnamic acid has therapeutic implications for various neurodegenerative diseases and LSDs.
In addition to TFEB, interestingly, in our study, we observed that cinnamic acid enhances the activity of lysosomal proteases Cathepsin B and TPP1 in cultured primary astrocytes as well as in the cortex of 5XFAD mice.
Mounting evidence has highlighted the role of Cathepsin B and TPP1 have as therapeutic targets in AD models
Enhancement of cathepsin B activity has been demonstrated to have anti-amyloidogenic and neuroprotective effects.
In aged hAPP mice, induction of Cathepsin B reduces the amyloid plaque deposits including thioflavin-S plaques
Recent study has highlighted the role of another lysosomal protease TPP1 in destabilizing and degrading fibrillar Aβ by cleaving it within the β-sheet region
Therefore, cinnamic acid mediated induction of lysosomal proteases might play roles in countering the amyloid pathology.
Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for preventing or halting AD.
The available therapies are designed to provide only symptomatic relief.
Furthermore, these therapeutics often exhibit many side effects and inadequate outcomes.
Enhancement of lysosomal function has been explored as a therapeutic strategy in several animal models of AD.
In one study, positive lysosomal modulation by PADK demonstrated reduction of amyloid pathology and improvement of memory
Moreover, virus mediated TFEB overexpression have been shown to attenuate amyloid burden by facilitating lysosomal function
Cinnamic acid has several benefits over available AD therapeutics.
Firstly, it is a natural plant-based product and is relatively non-toxic.
Cinnamic acid is present in huge amount in vegetables, fruits and grains which are regularly consumed by people all over the world.
Secondly, cinnamic acid can be taken orally, the least painful route.
Thirdly, cinnamic acid is readily available and much cheaper compared to available AD therapeutics.
Importantly, cinnamic acid derivatives have been demonstrated to function as cholinesterase inhibitors and might have therapeutic beneficial in AD
In-vitro study by
These findings further suggest that cinnamic acid could be a potential therapeutic target in AD.
In conclusion, our study delineates a role of cinnamic acid in inducing lysosomal biogenesis via upregulation of the master regulator, TFEB.
Furthermore, our study identifies cinnamic acid as a ligand for the nuclear hormone receptor PPARα and establishes activation of PPARα by cinnamic acid as the underlying mechanism through which it transcriptionally upregulate TFEB to promote lysosomal abundance.
Finally, our study demonstrates that cinnamic acid treatment attenuates amyloid plaque pathology and improves memory in 5XFAD mice through PPARα.
Therefore, cinnamic acid may have therapeutic implications for lowering the pathogenesis of AD and other lysosomal storage disorders.
