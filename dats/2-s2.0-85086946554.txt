Effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 allele on the progression of cognitive decline in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease
Introduction: Possession of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele advances amyloid  (A) deposition and symptomatic onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas its effect on the rate of cognitive decline remained controversial.
We examined the effects of APOE 4 allele on cognition in biomarker-confirmed late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and mild AD subjects in the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) and North American ADNI (NA-ADNI).
The "early AD" (ie, combined LMCI and mild AD) cohort of 649 subjects from J-ADNI and NA-ADNI were selected based on positivity of A confirmed by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid testing.
The rates of cognitive decline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog) from baseline were examined using mixed-effects model.
The effect of 4 on time to conversion to dementia was also analyzed in LMCI using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and log-rank test.
The rates of cognitive decline were not significantly different between 4 carriers and 4 non-carriers in the total early AD cohort, which were affected neither by region nor by the number of 4 alleles.
In LMCI, 4 carriers showed almost the same progression rates as 4 non-carriers, except for a significantly faster decline in MMSE (P = .0282).
Time to conversion to demenita was not significantly different between
and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

In 4-positive mild AD, the rates of decline in MMSE (P = .003)
and CDR-SB (P = .0071)
were slower than those in 4 non-carriers.

DISCUSSION:
The APOE 4 allele had little effect on the rates of cognitive decline in the overall biomarker-confirmed early AD, regardless of region and number of 4 alleles, with a slight variability in different clinical stages, the 4 allele being slightly accelerative in LMCI, while decelerative in mild AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, which is pathologically characterized by amyloid deposits composed of amyloid  (A) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles rich in tau protein.
Recent studies suggest that pathological changes in AD brains, especially A accumulation, precede symptomatic manifestation by ∼15 to 20 years, followed by tau-mediated neurodegeneration.
The 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE)
gene is a strong genetic risk factor for the development of AD.
Among the three genetic polymorphisms of the human APOE gene causing variation in two amino acid residues, that is, 2, 3, and 4,
5]
contrast to the well-established effects of the 4 allele on the onset age of AD, it is controversial whether 4 allele affects the speed of cognitive decline after the symptomatic onset.
Some studies have suggested the accelerating effects of the 4 allele on the progression rate of AD: The cognitive decline in 4 homozygotes has been reported
to progress faster compared with 4 heterozygotes
Of interest, some studies have documented a longer disease duration and less mortality of 4-positive patients with AD,
In view of the needs for earlier intervention into the pathophysiology of AD using mechanism-based therapies, the earlier stages of AD are being highlighted.
Clinically, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as a stage between the cognitively normal stage and dementia,
Carriage of the 4 allele also has been shown
to increase the risk of development of MCI.
Although the effects of the 4 allele on the progression rate of MCI have not been established yet, some studies have suggested that 4-positive MCI individuals show faster cognitive deterioration, higher rate of conversion to dementia, and faster brain structural changes than the 4-negative individuals.
3]
However, previous clinical studies on MCI and AD, in which the diagnosis was not necessarily based on amyloid biomarkers, have been inaccurate in the diagnosis of the early stages of AD.
Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) data in recent phase 3 trials of solanezumab showed that ∼22% of subjects diagnosed as mild AD by clinical criteria did not show evidence of amyloid accumulation.
Furthermore, a number of recent clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for AD target "early AD," combining MCI due to AD (prodromal AD) and mild AD as a single continuous entity.
Especially, in the recent phase 2 trial of an anti-A protofibril antibody BAN2401 on early AD participants, the restriction of enrollment of 4 carriers in the highestdose, active-drug arm but not in the placebo group, raised a question if the observed significant effects of the antibody treatment were due in part to the difference in the rates of progression in cognitive decline between 4 carriers and non-carriers.
This prompted us to examine the effects of the 4 allele on the progression rate of early AD population with biomarker confirmation of A pathology.
In this present study, we aimed at elucidating the impacts of APOE 4 carriage on the progression of cognitive decline in the early AD population, based on the data sets of the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) and the North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (NA-ADNI) studies, which provide ideal information for the analysis of longitudinal effects of APOE 4 allele on individuals with confirmed A pathology.
These two studies are one of the largest observational studies on early AD in Asians and Caucasians, and can be compared and integrated because they were conducted with nearly identical protocols.
We further analyzed the regional difference, allele-number dependency, and disease-stage specificity of the effects of 4 alleles on the progression rate of early AD.

METHODS

Sample datasets
The data set of the J-ADNI (Research ID: hum0043.v1,
2016) was obtained from the National Bioscience Database Center (Tokyo, Japan)
with approval from its data access committee (
Entire data were downloaded on October 11, 2017.
The inclusion/exclusion criteria of LMCI and AD in J-ADNI are described in a previous report.
Briefly, the age of participants must be between 60 and 85 years.

Assessments and variables analyzed
Progression rates of cognitive decline were evaluated by changes of the scores of MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog), and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).
In accordance with the study protocol of J-ADNI and NA-ADNI, longitudinal changes were evaluated by scores at baseline, 6 , 12, 18, 24, and 36 months for LMCI subjects and at 6, 12, and 24 months for mild AD subjects and early AD subjects.
The data after those time points and one data point at 18 months in NA-ADNI were not used for analyses, in order to ensure comparability and consistency between NA-ADNI and J-ADNI.
We analyzed age when subjects are diagnosed at baseline visit (age at diagnosis) instead of age at onset, because ADNI study does not collect age when symptoms start.
In the J-ADNI data set, positivity of A accumulation was defined as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) >1.5 in 11 C-Pittsburgh

In the NA-ADNI data set, positivity of A accumulation was defined as an SUVR >1.5 in 11 C-PiB PET, SUVR >1.11 in AV45 (florbetapir)-PET, or CSF A 42 <192 pg/mL.
The amyloid status of subjects was determined to be positive when at least either of the PET or CSF results at baseline were positive.
Subjects who showed contradictory results in PET and CSF tests were included in the A-positive group.

RESULTS

APOE 𝜺4 carriage does not influence the rate of cognitive decline in early AD
We and non-carriers using a mixed-effects model, and found that the rates of decline in the above three cognitive scales were not significantly different between 4 carriers and non-carriers, suggesting that the carriage of 4 alleles does not affect the rate of progression after the symptomatic onset in early AD (Table
To see the effects of regional difference, we compared the slopes of decline in 4 carriers and noncarriers separately in the J-ADNI and NA-ADNI data sets.
No significant differences were observed in the slope of decline between 4 carriers and non-carriers in J-ADNI or NA-ADNI (Table
Furthermore, we compared the speed of cognitive decline among the 4 non-carriers (0), heterozygotes (1), or homozygotes (2) of 4 alleles, to see if there is a gene dosage effect of 4 alleles on the rate of progression.
The progression rates of cognitive decline in heterozygotes and homozygotes were not significantly different from those in 4 non-carriers, suggesting that the number of the 4 alleles had little effect on the symptomatic progression in early AD (Table
Taken together, the APOE 4 carriage did not affect the rate of progression in cognitive deterioration in early AD, regardless of the regional difference or the gene dosage of 4 alleles.

Differential effects of APOE 𝜺4 carriage on the rate of disease progression in LMCI and mild AD
To examine the effects of the 4 allele on the rate of disease progression in different disease stages, we separately analyzed the data in LMCI and mild AD.
The demographics of 348 LMCI (232 4 carriers and 116 non-4 carriers) and 301 mild AD (216 4 carriers and 85 non-4 carriers) are shown in Table
In LMCI, 4 carriers showed significantly younger age at baseline (P = .0441),
higher frequency of family history (mother: P = .0008,
father: P = .0004),
and higher score of ADAS-Cog at baseline (P = .0427)
than 4 non-carriers.
CSF biomarkers at baseline showed higher total tau and p-tau levels in 4 carriers than in 4 non-carriers.
We analyzed the 3-year longitudinal changes of MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-Cog in 348 LMCI subjects (74 from J-ADNI and 274 from NA-ADNI) using a mixed-effects model.

Carriers showed almost the same progression rates as non-carriers, except for a small but significantly faster cognitive decline in MMSE (P = .0282)
(Figure
We then asked whether carriage of 4 affects the time to conversion to dementia, another indicator of cognitive decline of LMCI.
Time to conversion of 4 carriers and noncarriers were shown as the Kaplan-Meier plots (Figure
Finally, we analyzed the rate of progression in 301 AD subjects, including 216 4 carriers and 85 non-carriers.
The demographics of 4 carriers and non-carriers in the AD cohort were not significantly different in most variables analyzed, except for a higher frequency of having family history of the mother (P = .0174)

DISCUSSION
Our present study showed that the APOE 4 allele does not affect the speed of cognitive decline in early AD, regardless of region and gene dosage of the 4 alleles.
This result may enable the precise interpreta-tion of the rate of changes in MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-Cog used as primary end points in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies targeting A on early AD.
Because of the variability in drug responsiveness depending on the APOE genotype in the past clinical trials,
The levels of CSF p-tau and total tau, markers of tau-related neurodegeneration,
These findings may suggest that the 4 allele accelerates tau-mediated neurodegeneration in the LMCI stage, but no longer in the mild dementia stage.
Previous studies on the effects of ApoE 4 alleles in cognitively normal individuals suggested that 4 contributes to lower cognitive performance and faster progression of cognitive decline.
It has also been shown that the accelerating effect of 4 on cognitive decline was observed in A-positive cognitive normal individuals, but not in A negatives.
Taken together, our results suggest that the 4 allele may contribute to neurodegeneration and associated cognitive decline in relatively earlier stages of AD pathophysiology, ranging from cognitively normal to amyloid-positive MCI stages.
Previous clinical studies, including ADNIs, have shown a strong association between carriage of 4 alleles and positive amyloid biomarkers in cognitive normal, MCI, and dementia.
Experimental studies in mice models of AD also have suggested that the APOE 4 alleles affect the biological process of A accumulation to increase its deposition.
Although at least one study suggested the effects of APOE 4 on tau-mediated neurodegeneration,
There are a couple of limitations in our study.
First, the observation period of our analyses was limited to 2 to 3 years, which might have characterized a limited duration of the early stages of AD, although we believe that our data might have implications in the interpretation of results in clinical trials at the early AD stage, which usually have a maximum follow-up of 2 years.
Second, the combined analysis of the J-ADNI and NA-ADNI data, which exhibited a couple of minor differences,
Finally, our study focusing on the composite cognitive battery may have missed the differential effects of 4 on specific cognitive domains; considering the previous report suggesting that 4 might specifically affect the episodic memory,


LMCI and AD subjects must have memory complaints by subject or study partner that is verified by a study partner.
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score must be between 24 and 30 for LMCI and between 20 and 26 for AD.
The global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score must be 0.5 (and memory box must be 0.5) for LMCI, and 0.5 or 1 for AD.
The cutoff score of Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised logical memory IIA (WMS-R LMIIA) is various depending on years of education: LMCI and AD subjects must be ≤8 for 16 or more years, ≤4 for 10 to 15 years, and ≤2 for 0 to 9 years.
NA-ADNI data sets were obtained from The Image Data Archive at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (https://ida.loni.usc.edu) with their approval.
Entire data were downloaded on July 11, 2017.
The inclusion/exclusion criteria of LMCI and AD in NA-ADNI are generally comparable with those in J-ADNI, except for age (between 55 and 90) and range of years of education in WMS-R LMIIA criterion: LMCI and AD subjects must be ≤8 for 16 or more years of education, ≤4 for 8 to 15 years, and ≤2 for 0 to 7 years.
Only LMCI subjects in NA-ADNI were used for analyses, and early MCI (EMCI) subjects in NA-ADNI were not included.
The "early AD" cohort was defined as LMCI or mild AD with positivity of A accumulation confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker or amyloid PET.


selected 74 LMCI and 70 mild AD subjects from the J-ADNI cohort, and 274 LMCI and 231 AD subjects from the NA-ADNI cohort, based on the A positivity verified by CSF A 42 and/or 11 C-PiB PET and the availability of APOE genotype.
The "early AD" cohort of 649 subjects represented the total of the LMCI and AD subjects from J-ADNI and NA-ADNI.
The demographics of the 448 4 carriers and 201 noncarriers in the early AD cohort are shown in Table1A.
The 4 carriers presented a significantly lower age at baseline (P = .0172)
and higher positivity of family history of AD (mother: P < .0001,
father: P = .0025)
compared with the non-carriers.
No significant differences were found between the 4 carriers and non-carriers in sex, education, baseline scores of cognitive tests, CSF total tau, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and SUVR of amyloid PET, except that 4 carriers showed slightly lower CSF A 42 compared with the non-carriers.
The 2-year longitudinal changes of MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-Cog from baseline in early AD are shown in Figure 1.
We compared the slopes of decline in MMSE, CDR, and ADAS-Cog between 4 carriers

Furthermore, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), an important adverse event in amyloid-removing antibody trials, are more frequent in 4 carriers.
Notably, it has recently become controversial if the imbalanced allocation of 4 carriers to the highest dose group in the trial of an anti-A protofibril antibody BAN2401, in which enrollment of 4 carriers in the active drug arm was avoided due to concerns of ARIAs, might have biased the effects in the activedrug group, if the natural course of progression of the 4 carriers were faster.
Our present results suggest that the effect of the frequency of 4 carriers on the speed of progression in the early AD population might be negligibly small, validating the signal of efficacy observed in the trials.

Further detailed analysis of data, especially those from the placebo group of large-scale clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies of AD with imaging and biomarker data, will elucidate the effects of APOE 4 alleles on the pathophysiological and symptomatic progression of AD at its early stages.


The survival distributions of time to conversion to AD were estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and the APOE 4 group difference was tested using the log-rank test.
The changes of cognitive variables (ie, MMSE, CDR, or ADAS-Cog) from baseline were analyzed based on the mixed-effects model that includes the APOE 4 status (eg, presence/absence or number of alleles [0, 1, or 2] of APOE 4), time point (months), interaction between time point and APOE 4 status, baseline value of the cognitive variable, age (continuous), and data source (J-ADNI or NA-ADNI) as fixed effects and the time point as random effects.
Using this model, we compared the slope of decline from baseline per month between the groups defined as APOE 4 status.
P-value <.05 were considered statistically significant.
All the statistical analyses were performed using the JMP pro 14.0.0 program and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
