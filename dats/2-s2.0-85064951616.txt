Introduction
The hallmark pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are known to start accumulating years before the onset of clinical symptoms
With the molecular definition of the disease
This interpetation of AD was enabled by advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers such as Aβ and tau to move from a clinically defined late stage disease to a biological definition of a disease process that starts many years before onset of clinical symptoms.
These research avances have resulted in a new set of criteria for AD to define the earliest stages in the AD continuum, i.e., cognitively normal individuals with an abnormal AD biomarker pattern, being preclinical AD
The amyloid cascade hypothesis brings forward the deposition of Aβ as a result of increased production and/or decreased clearance of A from the central nervous system, as the initial pathological trigger in the disease continuum, interacting with the microtubule-binding protein tau, forming NFT leading to widespread neuronal degeneration and dysfunction, cognitive decline and dementia
Genetic evidence from rare familial forms of AD as well as mutations in amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2 genes support the accumulation of Aβ as the causative factor for AD
While genetic evidence points towards Aβ as the initiator of pathology, the eventual clinical syndrome appears to be more closely related to the progression of the tau pathology.
The rate of cognitive impairment in AD and neuronal loss however strongly correlate spatially and temporally with the total tau burden and NFT formation
While Aβ pathology spreads inwards starting from the cortex, progression of tauopathy in AD topographically disconnects and goes in the opposite direction
In animal models, both Aβ and tau have shown self-propagation capabilities
Despite the prominent correlation of NFTs with cognitive impairment in AD, mutations in tau are not causative for AD but may result in dementia, without an AD clinical or neuropathological phenotype
Increasing preclinical evidence supports a possible interplay between Aβ and tau, whereby Aβ may exert its toxicity through tau by influencing or inducing the hyperphosphorylation, misfolding and secretion of tau
In addition, preclinical data demonstrates that tau is required for learning and memory deficits in the presence of Aβ
Aβ is being proposed as the trigger to AD, which may induce the cascade of downstream events including tauopathy, and tau as the bullet, driving the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits
This potential interplay would further strengthen the interaction between both key hallmark features of the amyloid cascade hypothesis already at the start of the AD continuum, hypothesizing that the relation of CSF tau to cognitive performance is dependent on Aβ pathology as measured by CSF Aβ levels.
The interaction of Aβ and tau, measured by means of CSF biomarkers  and p-tau181P), on cognitive performance as a clinical marker in normal participants and those in the earliest stages of the AD continuum defined as preclinical and prodromal AD (pAD) was investigated.

Methods

Study population
Participants screened from two separate clinical trials in early Alzheimer's disease (Study 1: NCT01978548
Both studies were conducted in sites across Europe in Caucasian participants between December 2013 and June 2016.

Study participants
A total of 256 participants (Study 1: n=112; Study 2: n=144), aged 50 to 90 years inclusive, who completed a standardized 4-step screening process for either studies to assess their eligibility according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Supplemental fig S1), were included in this study
Of the 256 participants who completed the screening process, a total of 10 participants were further excluded from final analysis, due to incorrect, incomplete or missing RBANS data recorded (n=7), missing p-tau181P data (n=1) or no CDR data (n=2) available, resulting in 246 evaluable participants.
Two paradigms were used to classify participants included (n=246) as depicted in Supplemental Fig.

Biomarker CSF Aβ1-42 and cognitive status (CDR).
Participants were identified as "preclinical AD" (CDR=0 and Aβ < 600ng/L [A+] n= 33), prodromal Alzheimer's disease (pAD; CDR ≥ 0.5 but no dementia; CDR=0.5 [n=104] and 1.0
[n=2], together with Aβ < 600ng/L [A+], n=106), "mild cognitive impairment" (MCI; CDR=0.5 and normal Aβ levels [A-](≥600 ng/L) , n=38) or "control" (CDR=0 and normal Aβ levels [A-], n=69).

Biomarker status alone independent of clinical stage; i.e., by Aβ (A-/A+) and tau (T-/T+) status.
Participants were considered T+ if CSF t-tau and/or p-tau181P were above the pre-defined cut-off (t-tau >350 ng/L; p-tau181plevels >70 ng/L).
All participants positive for p-tau181P were positive for t-tau given the strong correlation between both markers independent of Aβ status (A-: r= 0.95, p<0.001;
A+: r=0.95, p<0.001;
Supplemental Fig.
Overall, n=70 were A-/T-, n=37 were A-/T+, n=23 were A+/T-, and n=116 were A+/T+.

Assessments

Mini-Mental State Examination
The MMSE

Clinical Dementia Rating Scale
The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), a semi-structured interview of patients and informants, was used to measure a patient's current dementia status
The CDR demonstrates good reliability

Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)
The RBANS
For the purpose of this study, the first completion of the RBANS (either FORM A or B) was included in the analysis.

Collection and analysis of CSF A1-42, p-tau181p and t-tau Levels
All participants had a baseline CSF sample (12 mL) collected during screening by single lumbar puncture between the L3 and L4 or L4 and L5 intervertebral space.
CSF samples were collected in polypropylene tubes to avoid adsorbance of proteins to test tube walls.
CSF samples were mixed to avoid possible gradient effects, aliquoted, frozen and stored at -80°C immediately after collection.
All samples analyzed in this study had at most 1 freeze-thaw cycle.
CSF samples were analyzed at one central lab (Sahlgrenska University hospital, Sweden) for Aβ1-42, phosphorylated tau at position threonine 181 (p-tau181P) and total tau (t-tau) concentrations using INNOTEST  Phospho-TAU181, INNOTEST  hTAU Ag, and INNOTEST  β-AMYLOID1-42 (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium)
Diagnostic threshold CSF concentrations for AD versus normal control for Aβ1-42 (CSF A1-42 levels below cut-off value of 600 ng/L) were applied to the current sample set to assess the likelihood of having cerebral Aβ plaque deposition (A+)
In addition, elevated CSF t-tau (>350 ng/L) and/or p-tau181p levels (>70 ng/L) respectively (T+) as set by the analysis lab at the start of Studies 1 and 2 were applied to the current sample set to assess the likelihood of having neuronal injury and/or cerebral tau pathology (T+).

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Software version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
For categorical data, group differences were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test.
For numerical data when there were no clear departures from a normal distribution (age, height, weight, and BMI), balance across groups was evaluated with an F-test and pairwise group comparisons were analyzed by Student's t-test (equal variances) or Satterthwaite test (unequal variances).
Nonparametric statistics
Balance across groups was evaluated with a Kruskal-Wallis test.
For pairwise comparisons, Hodges-Lehmann estimates for median differences between groups were calculated.
Confidence intervals (CIs) and nominal p-values for the pairwise differences between groups were based on the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.
The choice of parametric versus nonparametric methods was driven by normality versus non-normality of data distributions.
Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the strength of association between RBANS indexes and tau (t-tau and p-tau181P).
Multiple linear regression models were employed to explore the relationship between cognition (RBANS) and biomarkers (Aβ1-42, t-tau and the interaction of Aβ1-42 with t-tau).
Similar models using p-tau181P instead of t-tau were analysed.
Both t-tau and p-tau181P were not included together in the same model due to colinearity.
Ranktransformed values were used for RBANS and biomarker variables in multiple regression models because assumptions for normality in the model residuals were not met.

Results

Demographic, biomarker and cognitive characteristics
Two paradigms were used to classify participants as depicted in Supplemental Fig.
i.e., by Aβ1-42 and tau (T-/T+) status (see
For both classifications, the demographic, cognitive (RBANS, CDR, MMSE) and biomarker characteristics (A1-42, p-tau181p, t-tau) are summarized in Table
The distribution of the overall population enrolled based on their Aβ and tau biomarker profiles is shown in Supplemental Fig.
Gender distribution was equal across groups independent of classification used (by Aβ1-42 and cognitive status or biomarker only).
A tendency towards higher representation of male subjects in the A+/T-vs the A+/T+ group was observed which was in line with earlier reports
Participants classified as pAD and A+/T+ had lower weight and BMI and participants classified as A-/T-were younger.

Prodromal AD, preclinical AD, control and MCI groups
No differences in CSF Aβ1-42 levels were observed amongst A+ groups (pAD vs preclinical AD) or amongst A-groups (MCI vs control).
Tau levels (t-tau; p-tau181P;median [range]) were significantly increased in both pAD (644.
The pAD group showed significantly increased tau levels compared with the preclinical AD group (p<0.001 for both t-tau and p-tau181P) (Table
Overall, pAD participants presented with a lower (median [range] global MMSE score (26 [14;30], p<0.001), and a lower RBANS Total Scale score (74 [47;124], p<0.001;

The pAD participants showed highest impairment (lowest score) on the Delayed Memory Index followed by the Attention Index, Immediate Memory Index, Language Index and Visuospatial Index.
The preclinical AD group showed a normal cognitive profile on the RBANS Total Scale and Index scores (Table

The MCI group showed the highest impairment on the Attention Index, followed by Delayed Memory, Immediate Memory, Language, and Visuospatial Index.

A-/T-, A-/T+, A+/T-, A+/T+ groups
High tau values (p-tau181P and t-tau) were observed only in the A+ participants.
Significantly (p<0.001) higher t-tau and p-tau181P levels (median [range]) were observed in the A+/T+ group (Supplemental Fig.
The A+/T+ participants presented with a significantly lower

The highest impairment (lowest score) was observed on Delayed Memory index, followed by Attention, Immediate Memory, Language Index, and Visuospatial Index (no significant difference with the A+/T-group; Supplemental Table
The A+/T-, A-/T+ or A-/T-group did not differ from each other based on the RBANS Total Scale score or RBANS Index scores.

Correlation between CSF tau levels (t-tau and p-tau181P) and cognitive impairment
In the overall group, the RBANS Total Scale score showed a moderate negative correlation to ttau (n=246; r=-0.434;
p<0.001;

However, when classified by Aβ status, the RBANS Total Scale score showed a moderate negative correlation to t-tau in the A+ participants (n=139; r=-0.451,
p<0.001) and not in the A-participants (n=107; r=0.137, p=0.16) (Fig.

Similar findings were observed for p-tau181P (Table
Both t-tau (p<0.0001) and the interaction of Aβ1-42 with t-tau (p=0.006) were statistically significant in their effect on RBANS, but not Aβ1-42 (Supplemental Table
When the regression included independent variables for age and sex (0 for female, 1 for male), again both ttau (p<0.0001) the interaction of Aβ1-42 with t-tau were significant (p=0.0127),
but not the other variables (Supplemental Table
APOE ε 4 carrier status was not included in the model since it was only available for the A+ participants.
Similar findings were observed for p-tau181P (Supplemental Tables

Discussion
We examined the role of tau and its possible interplay with Aβ, measured based on CSF biomarkers (Aβ1-42, t-tau and p-tau181P), on cognitive performance (RBANS) as a clinical marker in participants in the early AD continuum ranging from normal to preclinical AD and pAD.
Original screening paradigm allowed classification of participants based on their clinical function and evidence of Aβ pathology along the early stages of the AD continuum.
In addition, across the early AD continuum, CSF Aβ levels were shown to plateau while tau levels steadily increased with increased cognitive impairment.
In the current study, the correlation of cognitive/memory impairment with CSF tau was dependent on CSF Aβ levels indicative for Aβ pathology, suggesting the importance of an interplay between both hallmark features of the disease.
In addition, both tau and the interaction of Aβ1-42 with tau were significant in their effect on RBANS, but not Aβ1-42 alone.
Earlier publications have suggested that tau correlates with, and is predictive of, clinical function and cognitive impairment
In the current study, clinical function aligned with cognitive performance
The pAD group presented an RBANS Total Scale score and RBANS Index scores in line with AD pathology
CSF tau levels (t-tau and p-tau181P) increased across stages in the early AD continuum (preclinical and pAD) with the pAD group showing highest tau levels.
No further decline in CSF Aβ levels was observed across early AD stages, suggesting that CSF Aβ levels may plateau early while CSF tau levels further increase and may drive cognitive decline
High CSF levels of t-tau and p-tau181P have been associated with a distinct cognitive profile with more severe impairment of memory and mental speed, and executive functions, not explained by disease severity (van der
In contrast, the amount of Aβ accumulation or its removal by immunotherapy has been shown not to correlate with cognitive performance
In addition, substantial Aβ deposition may also occur without affecting cognitive performance overall
Based on the above, Aβ pathology appears to be an early marker of incident disease.
The observation of elevated CSF tau levels already in the preclinical AD stage is in line with previous studies
However this finding is not observed in some studies
The CSF tau elevations may indicate that the preclinical and pAD groups are already in a state of neuronal injury/degeneration.
CSF Aβ levels did not significantly differ between A+ populations, despite the fact that pAD participants presumably have more accumulated brain Aβ pathology compared to preclinical AD participants.
CSF Aβ and Aβ PET measures do not change precisely in parallel as they measure different aspects of the AD amyloid pathology
CSF Aβ significantly decreases early in preclinical AD and then remains rather stable, whereas the Aβ PET signal would continuously increase in the non-demented AD stages, lowering again in the symptomatic stage of the disease
In contrast to the pAD group, the MCI group presented with a less severe and slightly distinct cognitive profile from the pAD group.
The overall MCI group presented normal CSF tau levels indicating that the cognitive impairment may have another etiology than AD.
When classifying participants solely based on their CSF biomarker profile, it became apparent that CSF Aβ or tau levels alone did not result in significant cognitive changes compared with the participants having normal CSF levels.
While T+ participants were observed in both A+ and A-groups, high CSF tau levels were only in A+ participants, suggesting that Aβ pathology may further drive or advance CSF tau levels resulting in synergistic rather than additive
Recent in vivo labelling data suggest that neurons may respond to Aβ pathology by increasing their secretion of both total and phosphorylated tau
In the current analysis, cognitive/memory performance correlated with CSF tau levels (t-tau and p-tau181P) in the early stages of the AD continuum
However, the correlation observed is Aβ dependent and only present in the Aβ positive group,.
This correlation with CSF tau levels (t-tau and p-tau181P) was also observed for all relevant RBANS subdomains, Delayed Memory, Attention and Immediate Memory on the background of Aβ.
A recent meta-analysis of preclinical data in transgenic mice further supports a primary role for tau in cognitive decline in preclinical AD, while Aβ may rather play an indirect role in the development of NFT
In contrast, other groups have observed the opposite, showing a correlation of cognitive impairment with Aβ on the backbone of tau in preclinical AD and MCI
The data presented in this study are suggestive of an interplay between Aβ and tau in relation to cognitive impairment/decline in AD.
Both are required to induce the impairment while tau pathology is driving the level of impairment.
Supportive hereof is that widespread cortical tau pathology (Braak stage≥3) has commonly been observed in patients with Aβ plaques, although not in patients without plaques, supporting the hypothesis that Aβ aggregation is required for the appearance of high cortical tau pathology
In addition, significant interactions between CSF Aβ and CSF p-tau levels have been shown to affect brain structure (MRI) only in preclinical AD patients positive for both CSF Aβ and tau.
This interaction is suggestive of a 2-phase phenomon of pathological cortical thickening associated with low Aβ, followed by atrophy and cognitive decline associated with abnormal (high) CSF p-tau levels
Recent preclinical studies have highlighted several possible pathways by which Aβ could directly and indirectly influence the levels of tau, induce hyperphosphorylation of tau and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles
In in vitro and in vivo (transgenic mice) models, inhibition of Aβ production by beta and gamma secretases elicits Aβ aggregation and subsequent tau pathology (incl.
CSF tau) suggesting tau to be downstream effect of Aβ pathology
Extracellular p-tau seeds can induce tauopathy in neurons, supporting the hypothesis that tauopathy can spread in a prion-like fashion between neurons, a cascade that could be potentially initiated or accelerated by Aβ pathology
In such a case, optimal treatment to prevent cognitive decline/impairment should ideally start prior to tau reaching pathological (high) levels in CSF or before reaching levels associated with cognitive decline, hence in preclinical AD stage 1 or 2
Current ongoing studies in preclinical AD targeting Aβ (e.g., BACE inhibitor studies) will provide further insight into this possible interaction between Aβ and tau and the ability to prevent cognitive decline and increases in tau pathology by Aβ inhibition.
As all participants were screened in light of an AD clinical trial, the population included may not be representative for the overall continuum as some patients may have presented with subjective memory complaints.
However, data presented clearly demonstrated that based on the screening paradigm applied, different population groups could be identified from normal controls to preclinical AD and ppAD and even MCI .
Secondly, this study only reports cross-sectional data, and longitudinal data further supporting the hypothesis that tau pathology correlates to cognitive decline on the backbone of Aβ (CSF) are needed.
Furthermore, although similar correlations between CSF tau and cognitive impairment have been reported before, opposite results have also been reported, still describing an interaction between Aβ and tau in the opposite direction.
Where most studies opted for the classical clinical and cognitive measures such as MMSE, CDR and ADAS-cog, we applied next to the CDR and MMSE, for the RBANS as a sensitive and specific measure for cognitive function, currently applied in several multicentre trials in AD, which may clarify some of the differences observed.

Conclusion
Across the early stages of the AD continuum, cognitive/memory performance correlated well with CSF tau levels.
However, the observed correlation is Aβ-dependent and only present in the Aβ-positive group indicating the importance of a possible interplay between both neuropathological hallmarks of AD.
