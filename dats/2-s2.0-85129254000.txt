Neuroprotective Effects of Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Current Scenario in Therapies for Alzheimer’s Disease and Future Perspectives
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease conceptualized as a continuous process, ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to the mild, moderate, and severe clinical stages of AD dementia.
AD is considered a complex multifactorial disease.
Currently, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI), such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, has been the main treatment for AD patients.
Interestingly, there is evidence that ChEI also promotes neuroprotective effects, bringing some benefits to AD patients.
The mechanisms by which the ChEI act have been investigated in AD.
ChEI can modulate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is an important signaling cascade that is capable of causing a significant functional impact on neurons by activating cell survival pathways to promote neuroprotective effects.
However, there is still a huge challenge in the field of neuroprotection, but in the context of unravelling the details of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a new scenario has emerged for the development of more efficient drugs that act on multiple protein targets.
Thus, the mechanisms by which ChEI can promote neuroprotective effects and prospects for the development of new drug candidates for the treatment of AD are discussed in this review.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease.
AD is conceptualized as a continuous process, spanning from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by progression from the mild, moderate, and severe clinical stages of AD dementia
AD is the most common cause of dementia worldwide.
It is estimated that over 139 million people worldwide will develop dementia by 2050, and among them, about 50-60% will develop AD
AD is characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as a result of the accumulation of extracellular aggregated amyloid-␤ ISSN 2542-4823 © 2022 -The authors.

(A␤) and intracellular aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively
The loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain leads to impairment of cholinergic transmission, being the main cause of a cognitive decline in patients with AD
Due to the essential role of acetylcholine (ACh) in cognitive function, a cholinergic hypothesis was raised for the pathogenesis of AD, based on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation and reduced ACh synthesis
Since ACh is involved in several physiological processes (such as memory, attention, learning, sensory information, and other critical functions), the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the brain leads to reduced ACh levels, affecting cholinergic transmission, generating cognitive deficits
Therefore, the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE), which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, has become an important therapeutic target for AD
Different AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) were developed based on the cholinergic hypothesis
However, the effectiveness of these drugs is limited since they reduce AD symptoms, but they are unable to stop disease progression
There are several literature reports showing that some AChEIs demonstrate neuroprotective effects that were unrelated to enzyme inhibition
Thus, new therapeutic strategies are focusing not only on the amplification of cholinergic activity but also on modulating non-cholinergic functions; these strategies have been emerging to develop new disease-modifying agents for AD treatment
This review addresses the mechanisms by which cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors promote neuroprotective effects, which are capable of bringing benefits to patients with AD.
In addition, we also show new perspectives in the development of potential drug candidates endowed with neuroprotective capacity, which have been designed for AD therapy.

CHOLINESTERASE ENZYMES
ChE is a ubiquitous class of serine hydrolases that cleaves choline esters.
There are two forms of ChE (encoded by two distinct genes): AChE, which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)
Although both enzymatic forms exhibit similar catalytic activities, they differ in ionic or hydrophobic interactions
AChE is primarily located at neuromuscular junctions and cholinergic synapses in the central nervous system (CNS), where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of ACh into choline and acetate, making it responsible for terminating ACh-mediated synaptic transmission with high catalytic efficiency
AChE is structurally composed of an active catalytic site (CAS), the peripheral anionic site (PAS), and the gorge region (Fig.
The CAS site is located at the bottom of the gorge region, which is about 5 Å wide and 20 Å deep, lined with up to 14 conserved aromatic residues, whose rings constitute ∼70% of the gorge surface
CAS is the local where the hydrolysis reaction occurs and contains a catalytic triad (H440-E327-S200) and the critical aromatic residues, W84 and F330.
The PAS is located near the entrance to the gorge, being composed of Y70, Y121, and W279 aromatic residues that are essential components of this site.
PAS is a low-affinity binding site essential to forwarding ACh and to controlling substrate specificity at the gorge
BuChE, also known as pseudocholinesterase or nonspecific cholinesterase, can hydrolyze larger substrates such as succinylcholine and acetylcholine, and, in particular, butyrylcholine
Similarly to AChE, BuChE is structurally formed by a 20 Å gorge lined with six aromatic amino acid residues, a CAS site, and a PAS site
Unlike AChE, in BuChE, the choline-binding site was replaced by Ala (A328), and the peripheral site was reduced to only two residues (D70 and Y332).
These changes are likely responsible for the activation of the substrate characteristic of BuChE.
In the acyl pocket of AChE, the Phe residues were replaced by less bulky aliphatic residues (L286 and V288); in BuChE, it increases the volume of the pouch, allowing the accommodation of larger substrates
AChE is mainly from the neuronal origin, whereas BuChE is primarily originated from glial cells
Under normal conditions, ACh is predominantly decomposed by AChE, while BuChE plays a supportive and functional role
Thus, the development of novel ChE inhibitors (ChEI) has been a promising approach for AD therapy
However, it has been reported that BuChE levels increase as the AChE level decreases in AD patients at late-stage
Furthermore, there is evidence that both AChE and BuChE have secondary non-cholinergic functions, which include the deposition of A␤ peptides in the form of senile plaques and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of patients with AD
Therefore, the development of new selective AChE and BuChE inhibitors is of crucial importance for new therapeutic modalities in AD

INTERACTIONS OF ChE WITH A␤ PEPTIDES
A␤ peptides are the main constituent of senile plaques and an important neurotoxic agent in AD
AChE forms stable complexes with A␤ peptides during the enzyme assembly into filaments, consequently accelerating this process and stimulating the fibril elongation
This may be one of the reasons by which AChE is consistently found in deposits of amyloid plaques
The interaction between AChE and A␤ peptides occurs due to the involvement of a small hydrophobic peptide that contains a conserved tryptophan (W279) located at the PAS site of AChE, contributing to the formation of a highly toxic complex
In vitro studies showed that the action of AChEIs directed towards the PAS site are capable of inhibiting the AChE effect on the assembly of A␤ filaments, whereas inhibitors of the AChE CAS site did not show the same effect
BuChE is also associated with amyloid plaques and it co-localizes with the A␤ peptide
In contrast to AChE, reports show that BuChE inversely associates with A␤ peptides and delays the beginning of their assembly, decreasing the rate of in vitro A␤ fibril formation
The PAS site of BuChE lacks three out of four aromatic residues that are found in the PAS site of AChE, thus exhibiting an inverse biochemical property
Several studies indicate that AChE-A␤ complexes promote major neurotoxic effects when tested in vitro or in vivo, compared to treatment with A␤ peptides.
Experiments performed in PC12 neuronal cell line demonstrated that treatments with AChE-A␤ complexes showed greater cytotoxicity than fibrillar A␤ complexes
Interestingly,
There is evidence that AChE strongly stimulate mouse A␤ aggregation in vitro, resulting in A␤-AChE complexes that are more toxic than A␤ fibrils
Accordingly, AChEIs that selectively act at the PAS site of the enzyme also prevent the formation of AChE-AB complexes, as well as the acceleration of A␤ peptide assembly into filaments.
Thus, AChEI seems to be an attractive and promising target for the development of new potential candidates for anti-AD therapeutic drugs

TRADITIONAL CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS
The various physiological alterations occurring in AD patients culminate in a reduction of ACh synthesis, as well as a decrease in cholinergic receptors, thus causing a reduction in cholinergic transmission
Thus, ChEI was developed to block the catalytic action of the AChE, resulting in increased levels of ACh in the synaptic cleft and activation of cholinergic receptors
Thus, Tacrine 1, donepezil 2, rivastigmine 3, and galantamine 4 (Fig.
Tacrine, an acridine derivative, was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993 to treat AD
It is a potent reversible and non-competitive AChE/BuChE inhibitor
Tacrine inhibits AChE through its interaction with the CAS site
Despite being an excellent cholinesterase inhibitor, soon after its registration, tacrine was withdrawn from the market due to adverse side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and low bioavailability
Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and diarrhea were also common side effects caused by regular tacrine administration
However, its chemical structure has been widely used to design new compounds that are capable of inhibiting ChE, with lower side effects and toxicity
Donepezil is widely prescribed for mild, moderate, and severe AD and has been considered a first-line treatment against this disease since 1996
It is a reversible, mixed inhibitor that exhibits competitive and non-competitive AChE activity
Donepezil is capable of simultaneously inhibiting both CAS and PAS sites of AChE
It has a selective activity for AChE, but only a modest effect on BuChE, unlike other compounds such as rivastigmine and tacrine
In addition to inhibiting AChE, donepezil also has activities at molecular and cellular levels in almost all stages involved in the pathogenesis of AD
However, adverse events can occur during its use, being significant at higher dosage (10 mg/d) compared to lower dosage forms (5 mg/d)
Symptoms can range from appetite loss, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and rhinitis.
However, gastrointestinal side effects are mainly observed
Rivastigmine was approved for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD in 2000.
It is a pseudo-irreversible carbamate-type of AChE and BuChE inhibitor, being selective for the CNS compared to peripheral tissues
It is classified as a pseudo-irreversible inhibitor because it binds to AChE that cleaves the rivastigmine molecule.
A covalent carbamoyl-AChE complex is formed, preventing the catalysis of acetylcholine and temporally inactivating the enzyme
Rivastigmine was initially administered orally, but due to gastrointestinal adverse events
Galantamine is an alkaloid belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, isolated from the Galanthus woronowii plant and indicated for treating mild to moderate AD
It is a reversible competitive and selective inhibitor of AChE interacting with the anionic subsite and the aromatic gorge, having only slight activity in the inhibition of BuChE
Galantamine has CNS selectivity with little effect on peripheral tissues
Furthermore, it is an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)
Although its clinical efficacy is equivalent to that of donepezil

NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT OF TRADITIONAL ChE INHIBITORS
The mechanisms underlying the action of AChEIs drugs (donepezil, tacrine, rivastigmine, and galantamine) have been investigated not only for their effects on AChE inhibition but also for their ability to promote neuroprotection against cell damage.
However, there still remains an immense challenge in the field of neuroprotection
The A␤ cascade hypothesis, the most cited hypothesis in AD pathology, focuses on the abnormal processing of amyloid-␤ protein precursor (A␤PP), leading to imbalance between the production and clearance of A␤, generating an excess of A␤ aggregation and neurotoxicity
Several studies conducted in neuronal cultures treated with donepezil
In animal models, donepezil was able to induce cognitive and behavioral improvements, as well as decrease the deposition of A␤ peptide and reduction of neuronal death
Other studies showed that donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine could promote neuroprotection and reduce A␤ deposition
Furthermore, AD patients treated with donepezil revealed improvements in cognitive functions and decreased levels of A␤ in peripheral blood cells
Another hypothesis is based on tau protein hyperphosphorylation leading to the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain of AD patients
Glycogen synthase kinase-3␤ (GSK-3␤) is one of the central kinases responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation. Studies suggest that the neuroprotective effects of donepezil would also be occurring through the inhibition of GSK-3␤ activity
Interestingly, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine showed a neuroprotective effect against the toxicity of okadaic acid, an inducer of tau protein hyperphosphorylation, reducing neuronal death
Treatment of AD patients with donepezil for six months caused an increase in phosphorylated GSK-3␤ (inactive enzyme), which would reflect a reduction in tau protein phosphorylation
The cortical neurodegeneration of AD is also attributed to glutamate-induced neurotoxicity
Several studies have shown that donepezil protects neurons against glutamate-induced toxicity by reducing Ca 2+ influx, caspase-3 activation, and neuronal death
There are reports showing that tacrine and galantamine can also reduce glutamate-induced cell death
Under conditions of tissue injury, such as ischemia, the generation of oxidative stress can cause damage to all major cellular molecules
On the other hand, under oxygen-glucose deprivation, assays performed in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons showed that donepezil caused protective effects against ischemic damage; however, galantamine, tacrine, and rivastigmine did not promote the same effect
A protective effect of galantamine against oxidative damage has been observed in neuronal cultures
Furthermore, in vitro pre-treatment with donepezil could protect endothelial cells against damage induced by hydrogen peroxide
In the last decade, several reports in the literature have focused on the ability of ChEI to induce neuronal recovery by increasing neurogenesis and neuritogenesis.
Several studies demonstrated that donepezil could promote neuronal differentiation and neurite growth in vitro and in vivo
The importance of ChEIs is mainly centered on their mechanisms related to neuroprotection, and its capability of acting on different targets or processes in AD (Fig.
The ChEIs action occurs by modulating the cell survival pathway to promote neuroprotective effects.
Most of these effects induced by ChEI are related to the stimulation of nAChRs, downregulation of NMDA receptors, and consequently, induction of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways
PI3K/AKT pathway plays a significant functional impact on synaptic plasticity, neuronal polarity, neurotransmission, usedependent translation, metabolic control and stress responses, including DNA repair in the brain
Thus, the PI3K/AKT pathway has been increasingly investigated regarding its role on the induction of neuroprotective effects.

PI3K/AKT PATHWAY MEDIATING THE MULTI-TARGET EFFECTS IN AD
PI3K/AKT pathway provides a link between several pathological processes in AD, such as ageing "itself", glucose metabolism, A␤ aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, synapse loss, oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuronal death
The PI3K/AKT pathway can be induced by AChEI through signaling by nAChRs reported in in vitro studies
To date, about seventeen subunits of nAChRs have been described
In mammalian brain cells, the most commonly found nAChRs are the ␣4␤2 heteromeric (␣4␤2-nAChR) and the ␣7 homomeric subunit-␣7 nicotinic ACh receptor (␣7-nAChR)
For example, the stimulation of ␣7-nAChRs contributes to memory formation and consolidation
On the other hand, the blockade of ␣7-nAChRs induces cognitive deficits in mice
In addition to inhibiting AChE, there is evidence that ChEI interacts with ␣7-nAChRs, which in conjunction with tyrosine kinase Fyn and Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2), lead to the activation of PI3K signaling cascade and induction of neuroprotective effects
PI3K is a plasma membrane-associated kinase protein composed of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit.
Upon activation, PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ), which further activates several downstream proteins, such as AKT
Activated AKT modulates key biological processes that are essential for maintaining cellular metabolism and cell survival
Notoriously, AKT plays an important role in the regulation of cell death through the activation of proteins, such as the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein family
Bcl-2 protein family includes Bcl-2associated death promoter (BAD), Bcl-2 Associated X-protein (BAX), Bcl-2, and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) proteins that localize within the mitochondrial membrane
Whereas Bad and Bax are pro-apoptotic proteins that can trigger the release of cytochrome C or caspase, thus inducing apoptosis, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are anti-apoptotic proteins that contribute to cell survival
Furthermore, AKT also acts on different processes, such as stress response, antioxidant defense and autophagy, through the inhibition of FOXO transcription factors
There are reports showing that A␤ oligomers alter the PI3K-AKT signaling
Actually, studies in AD patients demonstrated a downregulation of PI3K and its downstream targets
Of particular interest in AD, AKT normally inhibits GSK-3␤ and activates the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) protein, which is the main transcription regulator of antioxidant genes
As a consequence of GSK-3␤ activation, there is an increase in A␤ production, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and consequently, NFTs formation
In this context, GSK-3␤ seems to be an interesting, promising target for designing new drugs, under the hypothesis that its inhibition might impact several alterations in AD; some of them have been associated with reduced levels of A␤, tau protein, and neuronal death
An interesting finding is that activated GSK-3␤ promotes NRF2 downregulation
Since the role of the NRF2 gene is related to the antioxidant system, NRF2deficient mice present increased levels of oxidative stress, phosphorylated tau, A␤ accumulation
Interestingly, studies on mouse AD models showed that drugs targeting NRF2 are potential neuroprotectors and can ameliorate cognition in mice
Another key protein in the PI3K/AKT pathway is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is phosphorylated and activated by AKT.
mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two multi-protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORc1) and 2 (mTORc2)
mTORc1 plays a crucial role in preventing the initiation of autophagy, which is an essentially biological process responsible for the clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins, such as A␤ and tau, two proteins considered as hallmarks of AD.
Enhanced mTORc1 activity is associated with reduced A␤ clearance, accumulation of A␤ aggregates
mTORc1 can also upregulate A␤PP processing, enhancing A␤ formation
On the contrary, mTOR inhibitors have ameliorated cognitive function
mTORc2 can phosphorylate AKT and induce AKT signaling.
Additionally, mTOR plays a role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission
It has been demonstrated that the coordination between mTORc1 and mTORc2 is necessary for the correct functioning of AKT signaling
To counterbalance the PI3K-AKT pathway, other proteins, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein and Src homology domaincontaining inositol 5 -phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) are required as negative regulators of AKT signaling; these proteins induce the dephosphorylation of PIP 3 into PIP 2
In addition, PH domain and leucinerich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are also downregulators of Fig.
PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol
mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) also activate AKT signaling.
PI3K/AKT pathway regulates several cellular functions, such as inhibition of Glycogen synthase kinase-3␤ (GSK-3␤) that affects tau hyperphosphorylation, inhibition of Forkhead box O (FOXO) and Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) proteins, which are cell survival regulators, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2, and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL).
AKT also activates the mTOR Complex 1 (mTORc1) autophagy regulator and NRF2, which promotes antioxidant response.
In AD, the A␤ also acts by inducing GSK-3␤ activity, increased NFT formation.
The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can be regulated in several ways.
The Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein and Src homology domain-containing inositol 5 -phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) induce the dephosphorylation of PIP3 into PIP2, being negative regulators of PI3K/AKT signaling.
PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are also downregulators of AKT protein.
AKT by dephosphorylating AKT
Inhibition of PTEN in AD mouse models is associated with several consequences, such as reduced expression of Bax protein, decreased apoptosis, lower levels of DNA fragmentation, reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress
Noteworthy, reduced activation of PTEN and increased AKT phosphorylation might be involved in neuritogenesis and neurodifferentiation
Accordingly, targeting PTEN to induce AKT activation might be a potential approach to be investigated in AD therapy (Fig.
Over the years, the accumulation of literature information pointed out the increasing importance of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the pathogenesis of AD.
Altogether, several key proteins acting on this pathway can be selected as potential targets for the development of multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs), thus affecting simultaneously different stages of the signaling cascade
Thus, several compounds, that act in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, have been developed for the treatment of AD.
DL0410, a novel dual cholinesterase inhibitor, is a MTDL small molecule
Studies have shown that DL0410 improves cognitive deficits, and also mitochondrial function; besides, the activation of the AKT/GSK-3␤ and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway promotes the reduction of A␤ that can result in the induction of synaptic transmission
Treatment with EVP-6124 (encenicline), an ␣7-nAChR partial agonist, in patients with mild to moderate AD at Phase I (NCT00766363) and II (NCT 01073228) led to improvements in cognitive and clinical functioning, being safe and well-tolerated
However, Phase III studies (NCT01969136) have been suspended due to clinical hold.
Another potent and selective ␣7-nAChR antagonist, ABT-126, showed cognitive efficacy in animal models
ABT-126 was investigated in Phase I (NCT 00867399) and Phase II (NCT00948909) studies, demonstrating to be well-tolerated and safe, but a significant cognitive improvement was not observed in patients with mild to moderate AD
Phase I (NCT00948259) and II (NCT01350362) studies with NP031112, a GSK3 protein inhibitor, carried out in patients with mild and moderate AD demonstrated that the treatment was well tolerated, but without any clinical benefit
Another selective inhibitor of GSK3, AZD1080, tested in animal studies significantly reduced tau phosphorylation, reversing cognitive deficits
Hence, in the context of unravelling the details of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regarding its role linked to AD pathology and neuroprotective effects caused by certain therapeutic drugs, data in the literature on the outcome of clinical applications are still scarce; but in spite of this, a new scenario emerges towards the development of more efficient drugs, which act on multiple protein targets.
However, the consequences of inhibiting multiple targets must be investigated with caution, since the effects on more than one target may likely extend to different cellular processes, and these must be balanced against the desirable effects in terms of targeting the inherent changes to AD pathology.

NEXT-GENERATION ChE INHIBITORS
There is a growing interest in the development of potential MTDL drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.
This comes from the perception that for this disease, the pathophysiology may result from an impairment of a complex intracellular network, mainly involving important signaling cascade, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, as aforementioned.
In this context, relying on a single target or process will probably not achieve the desired result, mainly due to the existence of cross-signaling mechanisms, as well as a positive and negative control of molecular pathways.
Thus, interventions towards more than one step of this intricate molecular signaling network have great potential to overcome the pathological changes that occur in AD, although there are many limitations and the need to control biological responses and undesirable effects.
Although all initial AChEI drugs have been used as scaffolds to propose novel therapeutic compounds, a significant amount of these potential drugs relied on tacrine 1 to guide the research on anti-AD drug discovery.
It is still of interest nowadays, even though this compound was discontinued in 2013 due to its hepatotoxicity
Some novel tacrine-like hybrids were recently reported
Compounds with the highest ChE inhibition are represented in Fig.
It is worth mentioning that modifications in the tetrahydroaminacrine system have been proposed not only to increase the effectiveness of ChE inhibition, but also aiming to reduce hepatotoxic effects
Besides, many structures are endowed not only to achieve ChE inhibition, but also to obtain antioxidant properties, metal chelation, blockage of A␤ 42 self-aggregation, inhibition of BACE1, HDAC, or NMDA receptors, aiming to prevent neurodegeneration
Although there is a great interest in developing rivastigmine and galantamine analogues
Thus, here we focused on these kinds of structures.
Donepezil-based derivatives were also designed and synthesized as AChEI.
Their structure modification mainly relied upon replacing dimethoxy indanone fragment, responsible for the interaction with the PAS site, while preserving the benzylpiperidine moiety, which fulfils the CAS site
The hybrid molecular strategy was also employed, leading not only to novel selective ChEIs but also MTDLs, which possess other non-cholinergic effects, such as inhibiting MAO 19
Nevertheless, the hybridization of donepezil with tacrine was also attempted, originating potent compounds (Table
As mentioned above, despite ChE inhibition is still considered an important strategy for anti-AD therapy, interest in novel MTDLs designed for AD treatment is a crucial aspect in the search for effective outcomes.
Despite the neuroprotective effects reported for ChEIs, the effectiveness of drugs traditionally used in the clinic is modest, and there is an immense challenge in the search for more effective drugs capable of slowing the progression of AD, in addition to controlling the symptoms of the disease (Fig.
Thus, the search for understanding the molecular mechanisms of action of these compounds remains, highlighting the relevance of designing new drugs capable of reaching multiple targets in AD.

CONCLUSIONS
AD is considered a complex multifactorial disease.
The use of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) is currently the main treatment modality.
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that traditional ChEI is provided with cholinergic activities as well as activity against various AD molecular targets, but their effects in reducing AD progression are still limited.
In the field of therapeutic strategies for AD patients, it is extremely important to understand the signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms that are relevant for inducing neuroprotection.
In this context, a substantial progress has been observed and, for the short-term future, the expected amount of information may provide the essential basis for the development of new highly effective multi-target-directed ligand drugs designed to improve cognitive functions and reduce AD neurodegeneration.
