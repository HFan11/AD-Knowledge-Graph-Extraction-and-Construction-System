Discovery of nitazoxanide-based derivatives as autophagy activators for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
Drug repurposing is an efficient strategy for new drug discovery.
Our latest study found that nitazoxanide (NTZ), an approved anti-parasite drug, was an autophagy activator and could alleviate the symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In order to further improve the efficacy and discover new chemical entities, a series of NTZ-based derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as autophagy activator against AD.
All compounds were screened by the inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6K, which was the direct substrate of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its phosphorylation level could reflect the mTOR-dependent autophagy level.
Among these analogs, compound 22 exhibited excellent potency in promoting b-amyloid (Ab) clearance, inhibiting tau phosphorylation, as well as stimulating autophagy both in vitro and in vivo.
What's more, 22 could effectively improve the memory and

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction
There are lots of hypotheses about its cause but the underlying pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, which seriously hinders the development of new drugs for AD treatment.
Although so many efforts have been devoted to the R&D of anti-AD agents in recent years, the 99.6% failure rate of clinical research is among the highest for any therapeutic area, and it has been 16 years since the last drug, memantine, was launched
Currently, the available therapeutic options for AD are limited to several acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and one N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, which only provide limited symptomatic relief.
Therefore, there are still lack effective drugs in the clinic that could slow down or halt the disease progression, and new drug discovery strategy with high efficiency and low risk should be encouraged.
The two most representative pathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid senile plaques (SPs) caused by accumulated b-amyloid (Ab) peptides, and neurofibrillary tangles caused by abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein (NFTs)
SPs and NFTs have been closely involved in the pathogenesis of AD, and simultaneous regulations of Ab clearance and tau phosphorylation have been treated as promising strategies for drug discovery against AD
Ab is a type of peptides, which is produced from proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by band g-secretase
The amyloid hypothesis believes that excessive production and accumulation of Ab peptides can promote the formation of SPs and result in neuronal death
Ab-targeted therapies have played a central role in the treatment of AD in the last two decades.
A large number of research projects focusing on this therapeutic strategy for decreasing Ab level have been published, and some drug candidates have entered clinical trials, such as b-secretase (BACE1) inhibitor verubecestat (MK-8931)
Tau protein is kind of microtubule-associated protein that able to promote microtubules assembly and stabilize the integrity and function of microtubules in the neuronal cytoskeleton
In AD patients, hyperphosphorylated tau protein disengaged from microtubules, misfolded, and self-assembled into neurotoxic paired helical filaments (PHFs) which eventually aggregated to form the intracellular NFTs
Therapeutic strategies that target the tau pathway have received much attention for the potential treatment of AD, and some tau-based drug candidates also have reached to clinical research
However, at present, the two hypotheses are still controversial and questionable, for the clinical drugs targeting these two pathological hallmarks can't cure AD.
Based on the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD, more and more study showed that these two pathological symptoms are not independent but promote each other.
Under pathological conditions, Abinduced neurotoxicity induces abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, which in turn directly or indirectly promotes Ab production and inhibits Ab clearance, leads to the inability to completely cure AD for compounds that target only a single pathology.
Therefore, the compound nitazoxanide (NTZ) and its analogues able to break the cycle of Ab and tau hyperphosphorylation may show potential in the treatment of AD.
Autophagy is the process of clearing abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles that affect normal functions in cells
Mounting evidence suggests that autophagy deficits might contribute to the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including AD 25e28 .
Ab can be swallowed into autophagic vesicles and fuse with the lysosome, and then be degraded in the process of autophagy
Autophagy has been confirmed to be a major pathway for Ab clearance, along with Ab degradation enzymes
In addition, many studies indicated that autophagy could facilitate the degradation of a variety of forms of tau proteins
For example, autophagy inducer, rapamycin, was beneficial to the degradation of insoluble forms of tau
Thus, autophagy may be a promising therapeutic target for the development of anti-AD drugs.
Chemical genetics facilitates the discovery of new drug molecules, especially the forward chemical genetics, which screens the chemical libraries of small molecules for a interested phenotype, to discover positive molecules that could regulate the phenotype, and then uses the resulting molecules to treat the corresponding disease and identify potential drug targets.
Therefore, this strategy can be used to discover new drug molecules and explore new mechanisms
With a lab in-house FDA-approved drug library as the screening chemical library, and the phosphorylation level of p70S6K as the interested phenotype, NTZ (an antiparasite drug) was screened out as an autophagy activator for the potential treatment of AD, this is the R&D strategy of drug repurposing.
Our latest study has reported this finding
NTZ was able to stimulate autophagy and promote Ab clearance by inhibiting signaling pathway of both PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ULK1 and NQO1/mTOR/ULK1, and restrain tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/GSK3b signaling pathway, as well as effectively ameliorate memory and cognitive impairments of APP/ PS1 transgenic AD model mice
In order to discover new chemical entities (NCEs) and further improve the anti-AD efficacy, structural modification based on NTZ has been carried out, this is the so called drug redevelopment (Fig.
In this work, 52 NTZ-based compounds were designed and synthesized, and their abilities to promote autophagy were evaluated by phosphorylation level of p70S6K, which was the direct substrate of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin).
The phosphorylation of p70S6K could reflect mTOR-dependent autophagy level
At last, we found a candidate compound 22 with good bloodebrain barrier (BBB) permeability and low hERG inhibition activity.
What's more, 22 exhibited the most potent efficacy, even far more than NTZ, and it could not only significantly promote b-amyloid (Ab) clearance and inhibit tau phosphorylation but also largely improve the memory and cognitive impairments of APP/PS1 AD model mice.
These results demonstrated that compound 22 is a new chemical entity and promising agent for the treatment of AD.

Results and discussion

Design and synthesis of NTZ derivatives
In this study, NTZ was set as the lead compound and structural modification was carried out, aim to discover NCEs with improved efficacy and good BBB permeability that like central nervous system (CNS) drugs.
First, the 2-acetoxy group of NTZ was modified to obtain derivatives 2 (hydroxyl, tizoxanide) and 3 (hydrogen).
Then we investigated the substituent effect of 5-position on the thiazole ring of NTZ.
The 5-nitro group of NTZ was replaced by hydrogen (4), cyano (5), ester group (6 and 7), methylthio (8), methanesulfonyl (9), carboxyl (10), piperidyl (11), morpholinyl (12), pyrrolyl (13), and piperazinyl (
Compound 2, the active metabolite of NTZ, was commercially available.
The general synthetic routes of derivatives 3e10 were described in Scheme 1.
The commercially available substituted 2aminothiazoles (55e58) and previously prepared substituted 2aminothiazoles (59 and 60, Supporting Information Sections 1 and 2) were reacted with benzoyl chloride or 2-acetoxybenzoyl chloride with the Et 3 N as base to obtain target compounds 3e8.
Compound 8 reacted with m-chloroperbenzoic acid and the S atom was oxidized to sulphone to afford compound 9.
The ester group of compound 6 was hydrolyzed by LiOH to give intermediate 61, followed by reaction with acetic anhydride to afford target compound 10.
Scheme 2 depicted the synthetic route of derivatives 11e14.
The starting material 2-amino-5-bromothiazole hydrobromide was reacted with corresponding secondary amine derivatives through nucleophilic substitution reaction to provide key intermediates 62 (piperidine), 63 (morpholine), 64 (pyrrole), and 65 (1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperazine).
The intermediates 62e65 were reacted with 2-acetoxybenzoyl chloride in the presence of Et 3 N to afford target compounds 11e13, and intermediate 62 respectively.
The N-Boc protecting group of 62 was removed by utilizing silica gel in toluene at 80 C to afford target compound 14.
Morpholinyl containing derivative 12 was identified to display excellent p70S6K phosphorylation inhibitory activity (Table
The 2-acetoxyphenyl fragment of 12 was treated as the next modifying part, replaced by different substituted 2-hydroxyphenyl (15e18), various substituted phenyl (19e29), naphthyl (30 and 31), heteroaryl (32e38), cycloalkyl (39e44), alkyl (45e49), fluoroalkyl (50), arylalkyl (51 and 52), oxocycloalkyl (53) and oxoalkyl (54), and 40 derivatives (15e54) were designed.
The syntheses of derivatives 15e54 were outlined in Scheme 3. Derivatives 15e18, and 23e54 were obtained by acylation reaction of intermediate 63 with corresponding acyl chlorides 76e103 respectively.
Some acyl chlorides were commercially available, and the others were prepared by corresponding carboxylic acids reacting with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.
The acetyl group of compounds 11, 22 and 23 were hydrolyzed by LiOH to obtain derivatives 19e21 respectively.

Inhibitory activity of p70S6K phosphorylation
For the primary assay, the inhibitory activities of tizoxanide (2, the active metabolite of NTZ) and derivatives 3e54 for the phosphorylation of p70S6K with concentration of 20 mmol/L were measured by a-screen assay in SH-SY5Y cell.
NTZ and wortmannin (WORT) were the reference compounds.
The results were summarized in Tables
First, since NTZ was a prodrug which could be rapidly hydrolyzed to its active metabolite tizoxanide (2) in vivo, we tested the inhibitory activity of tizoxanide against the phosphorylation of p70S6K, and found its activity was almost comparable to that of NTZ (Table
Then, we also replaced the 2-acetoxy with hydrogen to give compound 3, and its activity was slightly improved compared to NTZ.
Subsequently, we modified the substituents on the 5-position of thiazole ring to afford compounds 3e14 to determine whether the activity may be enhanced.
Among them, compound 12, with the nitro group replaced by morpholinyl group, exhibited the most potency with an inhibitory ratio of 85.20% at 20 mmol/L (Table
However, once the 5-nitro group was removed (4) or replaced by ester groups (6 and 7), carboxyl (9), methanesulfonyl (10), or piperazinyl (14), the inhibitory activities against the phosphorylation of p70S6K were decreased significantly (Table
As shown in Table
First of all, we replaced the 2-acetoxy on the phenyl of compound 12 with the hydroxyl (19), and also introduced a substituent on the 4-position of phenyl to afford compounds 15e18, which both lead to significant decline in activities.
Then, we varied the position of hydroxyl and acetoxy on the phenyl or removed the 2-acetoxy, and compounds 20e24 with relatively effective activities were identified.
Especially, compound 22 with acetoxy on the metaposition of the phenyl, exhibited the most inhibitory potency (88.95% at 20 mmol/L, Table
Furthermore, changing 2acetoxy on the phenyl into other substituents (25e29) was not tolerated, leading to an obvious decline in potency.
In addition, the 2-acetoxyphenyl was modified to naphthyl (30 and 31) and heteroaryl (32e38), and these compounds showed good inhibitory activities.
However, replacing the 2-acetoxyphenyl with (cyclo)alkyl (39e49), fluoroalkyl (50), arylalkyl (51 and 52), oxocycloalkyl (53) and oxoalkyl (54) was not beneficial for the inhibitory potency.

In vitro bloodÀbrain barrier permeation assay
One of the major requirements for the development of drugs targeting the CNS is the good BBB permeability.
A parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) 36e40 , was performed to explore whether the optimized compounds 12, 20e24, 30e38, and 52 had the ability to penetrate into the brain.
The in vitro membrane permeability (P e ) of the selected compounds were determined through the porcine brain lipid (PBL), and it had been concluded that the compounds with the P e value more than 3.08 Â 10 À6 cm/s could penetrate BBB (CNSþ), while the P e values less than 1.13 Â 10 À6 cm/s could not penetrate BBB (CNSÀ).
For the compounds with the P e values in these boundary limits (1.13 Â 10 À6 cm/s < P e < 3.08 Â 10 À6 cm/s), their BBB permeability were unsure (CNSþ/À, Supporting Information Section 3, Fig.
As described in Table
Whereas, except for the compounds 20 and 21, the majority of the tested compounds (12, 22e24, 30e38, and 52) exhibited P e values above 3.08 Â 10 À6 cm/s, demonstrating that they had the potency to penetrate BBB.
Given that p70S6K is the direct substrate of mTOR
Next, we explored whether the optimized compounds 22 and 36 could regulate AKT/ mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathways and enhance autophagy by Western blot assay.
As shown in Fig.
These results indicated that compound 22 could suppress the inactivation of ULK1 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR, thus promoting the activation of autophagy.
As shown in Fig.
Therefore, it was uncertain that compound 36 could stimulate autophagy.
In addition, the compounds-induced autophagy stimulation was assessed by evaluating the expressions of 3 classic autophagy marker proteins, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II (LC3 II), Beclin 1 and p62
We found that compounds 22 and 36 both could upregulate the protein levels of Beclin 1 and LC3 II, and decrease the p62 protein level (Fig.
Moreover, an overexpression vector encoding mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 was used to verify the activation of 22 and 36 on

Compound 22 promoted Ab clearance and decreased the phosphorylation of tau protein
The modulation of Ab clearance by compound 22 was studied through an ELISA assay in BV2 cell.
As depicted in Fig.
What's more, compound 22 exhibited stronger potency than NTZ both for Ab 1À40 (20 mmol/L) and Ab 1À42 (5 and 10 mmol/L).
Next, we investigated whether compound 22 also exhibited the activity in suppressing the phosphorylation of tau protein by Western blot assay in the SH-SY5Y cell, and LiCl was used as positive control.
The BV2 cell was more suitable for Ab related assay
As shown in Fig.
Therefore, it was proved that compound 22 was able to promote Ab clearance and suppress the phosphorylation of tau protein.
Hence, compound 22 exhibited the multiple properties as potential anti-AD agent, for both promoting Ab clearance and decreasing the phosphorylation of tau protein.

hERG inhibitory activity
The effect on hERG potassium channels is an important evaluation method for cardiotoxicity of preclinical drugs
Therefore, the hERG inhibitory activities of compound 22 and NTZ were detected by patch clamp assay using cisapride as a positive control (Supporting Information Section 4).
The results were shown in Table

Compound 22 improved memory and cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic mice
The effects of compound 22 on ameliorating memory and cognitive impairments were evaluated in APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice by Morris Water Maze (MWM) assay and nesting test.
The APP/PS1 transgenic mice [B6C3-Tg (APP swe , PS1 dE9 )], which expressed chimeric mouse/human Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and mutant human presenilin 1 protein (PS1-dE9), exhibited early AD symptoms at 6e7 months of age, and these symptoms became more serious after 9 months of age
Herein, non-transgenic normal mice were orally administered vehicle (NV), while 9-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were orally administered vehicle (TV).
NTZ was at a dose of 30 mg/kg, and compound 22 was at two doses (10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively) over a period of 100 days before conducting MWM assay and nesting test.
During the last 7 days of the treatment, escape latencies to find the platform were recorded for the animals of different experimental groups in the MWM assay.
Besides, we removed the platform on the 8th day, and recorded their crossing times over the hidden location of the platform.
As shown in Fig.
3).
b
Compounds with permeabilities P e > 3.08 Â 10 À6 cm/s could cross the BBB by passive diffusion (CNSþ).
Compounds with P e < 1.13 Â 10 À6 cm/s show low BBB permeation (CNSÀ), and compounds with 1.13 Â 10 À6 cm/s < P e < 3.08 Â 10 À6 cm/s show uncertain BBB permeation (CNSþ/À).
PS1 mice (transgenic vehicle, TV) obtained longer escape latencies and less crossing time than normal mice (nontransgenic vehicle, NV).
Whereas, NTZ (30 mg/kg) significantly shortened the escape latencies of APP/PS1 mice compared with that of the TV group.
Corresponding to NTZ, compound 22 significantly reduced the escape latencies at an equivalent dose (30 mg/kg) and a lower dose (10 mg/kg).
Even more, 22 significantly increased the crossing times at a dose of 30 mg/kg compared with the TV group.
APP/PS1 mice suffered from impaired the nest-building ability at 6 months of age.
The nesting test was reported as a useful index of behavioral deficits, and widely used in the evaluation of anti-AD agents
As shown in Fig.
These results above revealed that compound 22 effectively improved memory and cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice.

Compound 22 reduced Ab level and inhibited tau phosphorylation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice
Our above assays demonstrated compounds 22 could reduce Ab level and inhibit tau phosphorylation level at cellular level, so what about the in vivo condition.
We subsequently evaluated the inhibition of compound 22 against the Ab 40/42 level in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the APP/PS1 transgenic mice using an ELISA assay.
The results were shown in Fig.
The NTZ and 22 treating group displayed significantly reduced Ab 40/42 level both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and 22 was more potent than the    approved NTZ.
A Western blot assay was subsequently conducted to detect the inhibition of 22 against p70S6K and tau phosphorylation in the cortex of the APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
As depicted in Fig.
NTZ was treated as reference.
These results demonstrated compounds 22 promote Ab clearance and inhibit hyperphosphorylation of tau both in vitro and in vivo.

Conclusions
Given that the current drugs for the treatment of AD only provide limited symptomatic relief, it is of great significance to discover more effective therapies against AD based on new strategies.
Prof.
Chong and Sullivan claim that the most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug
The FDA approved anti-parasitic drug NTZ was found to potentially treat AD by promoting Ab clearance and inhibiting tau protein phosphorylation.
The main purpose of redevelopment of NTZ is to acquire new chemical entities with more potent efficacy than NTZ.
We designed and synthesized 52 NTZ-derived compounds and they were evaluated as autophagy activator against AD. 14 derivatives (12, 22e24, 30e38, and 52) were found to display significantly enhanced p70S6K phosphorylation inhibitory activities, as well as greatly improved BBB permeability compared to NTZ.
Among them, compound 22 exhibited the most potent activity in promoting Ab clearance, inhibiting tau phosphorylation, and stimulating autophagy.
Further experiments demonstrated that compound 22 stimulated autophagy by suppressing the phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway.
Compound 22 also displayed good BBB permeability, low cytotoxicity, and low hERG inhibitory activity.
The in vivo pharmacological results revealed that compound 22 could reduce the escape latency, increase the crossing times in MWM assay, and improve nestbuilding behavior of APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice, which indicated compound 22 could effectively improve memory and cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice even more potent than NTZ.
In summary, our findings suggested that compound 22 could be considered as a potential drug candidate for further development of novel anti-AD agent.

Animal experiment
All animal experiments and care were performed according to the Institutional Ethical Guidelines of Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
APP/PS1 transgenic mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
Before the experiment, the genotypes of the mice were determined by tail biopsies with Tg-negative mice as negative control to confirm APP/PS1 DNA sequences.
The mice were fed in standard conditions of 12 h of light/day at a temperature of 22 C for 9 months.

Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica.
The mice were housed in separate cages before the experiment.
A piece of cotton (5 cm Â 5 cm in size) was placed into cage at 1 h before the dark cycle, and then the nesting score was determined after 12 h.
The nesting score included 0e5 points, with 0 indicating that the cotton was not touched observably, 1 indicating that the cotton was moved but only bit a little, 2 indicating that the bit area was less than 30% and only on the corner or on one side of the cotton, 3 indicating that most of cotton was shredded but scattered in the corner of the cage without building to a nest, 4 indicating that the cotton was completely shredded and an identifiable but flat nest was built, 5 indicating that the cotton was fully shredded and built to a nest with a burrow.

Detecting Ab level and phosphorylation of p70S6K, tau of APP/PS1 mice
The brain tissues were homogenized with RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and the homogenates were kept on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 20,000Âg for 30 min at 4 C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China).
Proteins were mixed with 4 Â loading buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and boiled for 15 min at 95 C. The Ab level was detected by ELISA assay and the following steps referred to the cellular ELISA assay.
The phosphorylation of p70S6K and tau were detected by Western blot assays and the following steps referred to the cellular assays.

autophagy.
At early stage of autophagosomes biogenesis, puncta of mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 accumulated and displayed both green and red fluorescent signals (mRFP-GFP þ yellow).
Notably, when autophagosomes were fused with lysosomes, they formed acidic autolysosomes (mRFP-GFP þ red), and the co-located mTagRFP-mWassbi-LC3 emitted only a red signal because the green signal quenched immediately under acidic conditions.
As shown in Fig.6A, both 22 and 36 increased the numbers of both yellow and red puncta compared with the control group, while autophagy inhibitor CQ efficiently abolished the effect induced by 22 and 36.
At the same time, compared with NTZ, 22 and 36 have better autophagy agonistic.
All the above results demonstrated that 22 and 36 could stimulate autophagy.
