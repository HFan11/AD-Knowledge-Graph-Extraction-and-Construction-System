Polygenic Score Models for Alzheimer’s Disease: From Research to Clinical Applications
The high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) among the elderly population and its lack of effective treatments make this disease a critical threat to human health.
Recent epidemiological and genetics studies have revealed the polygenic nature of the disease, which is possibly explainable by a polygenic score model that considers multiple genetic risks.
Here, we systemically review the rationale and methods used to construct polygenic score models for studying AD.
We also discuss the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with clinical outcomes, brain imaging findings, and biochemical biomarkers from both the brain and peripheral system.
Finally, we discuss the possibility of incorporating polygenic score models into research and clinical practice along with potential challenges.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD), an aging-related neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia, is a health threat to societies worldwide.
AD has a complex etiology that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, which account for its variable risk among individuals.
The presence of known coding mutations located in APP and PSEN genes that exhibit extremely high disease penetrance for early-onset AD can be determined by genetic analysis well before disease onset.
Moreover, sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD), which accounts for most AD cases, is suggested to be highly heritable (approximately 60-80%) in the general population
Therefore, studying individual genomes might identify individuals at high risk of developing AD, create a time window for intervention, and aid the development of intervention strategies.
However, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of LOAD have only revealed a few dozen genetic risk loci with mild or moderate disease risk-modifying effects; individually, these cannot adequately explain an individual's risk of having AD at the population level
The inconsistencies among epidemiological studies regarding the high heritability of LOAD as well as the lack of causal genetic factors that adequately explain disease risk imply that LOAD has a polygenic nature: its risk might be modulated by the aggregate effects of many hidden variants as well as environmental factors.
Accordingly, given that polygenic risk analysis has recently become a key facet in cohort studies of LOAD, herein we systemically review the current approaches to polygenic risk analysis along with their applications in AD.

KEY ELEMENTS OF POLYGENIC SCORE MODELS
Polygenic score models consider the aggregate effects of multiple variants to evaluate genetic contributions to continuous or discrete traits-for instance, gene expression levels or disease status
Hence, polygenic score models require knowledge about which variants modify the disease in question.
Variants are normally selected by screening the summary statistics generated by GWASs with proper filtering of the association p-values.
Various p-value thresholds can be applied (e.g., 0.0001, 0.01, or 0.5) to obtain the pools of variants that exhibit optimal performance for AD classification
Meanwhile, several methods have been applied to overcome the redundancy of genetic information (i.e., the effects of the variants on a given disease) due to high linkage disequilibrium among selected variants.
For instance, linkage disequilibrium-based pruning, which removes variants in high linkage disequilibrium, or linkage disequilibrium-aware clumping, which simultaneously removes variants in high linkage disequilibrium while retaining variants with the smallest p-values, have been applied to select the most informative variants to construct a polygenic score model.
In addition to p-value-based selection, other statistical learning methods such as lasso regression, which can select the most informative variants for AD classification by removing variants minimally associated with the disease, have been also incorporated into polygenic risk analysis for AD
Once the variants for model construction have been determined, their genotype dosages are summarized into a single value that can represent an individual's status (i.e., their relative risk of having AD).
The easiest way to achieve this is to simply sum the number of risk alleles across all selected variants to generate an unweighted polygenic score
Meanwhile, two types of weighting measures are commonly introduced into polygenic score models to account for the variable impacts of individual variants on disease risk and generate a more accurate polygenic score model.
First, the effect size can be determined from an association test, meta-analysis, or log-transformed odds ratios, thus yielding a weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) model
Second, log-transformed hazard ratios generated from association analysis for disease onset age can also be introduced to produce a polygenic hazard score (PHS), which indicates an individual's instantaneous risk of developing a given disease
Nevertheless, introducing statistical learning methods into polygenic risk analysis enables simultaneous variant selection and model construction.
Such methods, including lasso regression and support vector machines, can directly learn from the raw genotype data and use the same framework to construct models to predict various outcomes (e.g., phenotypes, cognitive performance, and onset age).
Moreover, they may perform better than PRS and PHS models given their ability to better capture both local and global genomic structures.

OVERVIEW OF POLYGENIC SCORE RESEARCH FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
The number of published research articles associated with AD polygenic score models has dramatically increased over the last 15 years (Figure
In 2005, one study reported an AD polygenic score model constructed from nine cholesterol-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including APOE-4 that exhibited superior performance for classifying AD compared to APOE-4 alone [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.74 vs. 0.66 for the polygenic score model and APOE-4, respectively] (
That study was also the first to demonstrate the applicability of polygenic score models to predict AD risk-even before AD GWASs demonstrated the polygenic nature of AD.
Large-scale AD GWASs in populations of European descent bolstered AD polygenic score research in recent years by providing comprehensive information about the effects of individual variants on AD risk at a genome-wide scale.
Those studies' summary statistics, which contain the effect sizes of individual variants, can be directly applied as weighting factors to construct a PRS model.
In fact, several AD polygenic risk studies were based on the summary statistics generated by the IGAP Consortium published in 2013
Meanwhile, a few other studies focusing on populations of non-European descent also applied the IGAP data to select variants for genotyping analysis
Notably, the study populations of most AD polygenic risk studies (Figure
The availability of GWAS results from AD genetics studies has enabled the selection of variants for model construction.
Studies using the same IGAP summary statistics can generate models with different numbers of variants (from 6 to 1.1 million sites) by selecting different p-value thresholds
Meanwhile, the sample sizes used for polygenic score models also vary among studies: from less than 80 to more than 20,000 participants
Regarding model construction, PLINK and PRSice are the most widely used tools to select variants and construct polygenic score models.
Other statistical analysis methods, such as linear support vector machine
Of note, polygenic score models have been implemented to investigate the effects of genetic variants on various aspects of AD pathogenesis and progression.
Most studies focus on clinical outcomes, specifically the classification of patients with AD
Some other studies investigated the possible associations between AD polygenic score models and the risk of conversion to AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
In the following section, we summarize the key findings of each of those aspects.

POLYGENIC SCORE MODELS FOR PREDICTING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RISK
The primary goal of a polygenic score model is to classify individuals according to disease risk (AD in this case).
Numerous studies conducted in recent decades have established various polygenic score models and report their ability to adequately distinguish patients with AD from cognitively normal individuals.
Reported AD prediction accuracy ranges from an AUC of 0.57
Notably,
0.69 for APOE genotype) in their discovery cohort
However, this model failed to surpass the accuracy of using APOE genotype to predict AD in their replication cohort (AUC = 0.62 vs. 0.63 for the PRS and APOE genotype, respectively; n = 276).
In contrast, several other studies demonstrate that PRS models exhibit superior performance to APOE genotype for predicting AD or associated cognitive states as indicated by significant associations between AD and PRSs that do not include APOE genotype
Specifically, in one study recently published by
Thus, polygenic effects might account for the non-APOE-dependent genetic mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.
Meanwhile, a wholeexome sequencing study conducted by
In addition to disease risk, a few studies investigated the possible contribution of polygenic risk to the modulation of the likelihood of AD conversion, specifically conversion from MCI to AD
Of note,
Furthermore,
Notably,
Moreover, Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al. (
However, the models in both studies included fewer than 10 non-APOE variants.
Meanwhile, by integrating more variants into the analysis,
Therefore, the polygenic risk effects from non-APOE loci probably contribute to the likelihood of AD development and progression.

POLYGENIC SCORE MODELS FOR PREDICTING MEMORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS
Besides disease states, polygenic risk is also correlated with individual memory function
Specifically, a multilocus mapping analysis conducted by
Specifically, a PRS study conducted by
Again, there is some controversy about the effects of non-APOE polygenic risks on memory function.
For instance,
Moreover,
Hence, the polygenic risk effects from non-APOE loci likely also influence memory function.
Polygenic scores can also indicate individual cognitive functions.
Several studies report associations between polygenic risk and cognitive functions
For instance,
Meanwhile,

POLYGENIC SCORE MODELS FOR PREDICTING BRAIN STATUS
The associations of polygenic scores with memory and cognitive function imply possible alterations of brain structure and functions.
Several studies have examined the associations between AD polygenic risk and MRI findings
Notably, some studies have examined the associations between AD polygenic risk and the volumetric changes of various brain regions such as the retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortices
Interestingly, some studies have focused on individuals of varying ages including young adolescents
Specifically,
In addition to structural changes, AD polygenic risk might be associated with brain Aβ load
Moreover, several studies discuss the possible effects of polygenic risk on brain functional changes including hippocampal activation
Meanwhile, Aβ measured by PET imaging has been introduced to stratify AD patients prior to PRS evaluation

POLYGENIC SCORE MODELS FOR PREDICTING BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND PERIPHERAL SYSTEM
Corroborating PET imaging findings, AD polygenic risk is also associated with the levels of several hallmark proteins of AD in postmortem brain tissues.
For instance, AD PRSs are reported to be significantly correlated with Aβ and tau tangle levels
Notably, AD polygenic risk might be correlated with the activity of brain γ-secretase (but not β-secretase)
As the ATN biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are correlated with the brain pathology in AD, several studies also suggest possible correlations between PRSs and CSF biomarkers including Aβ
However,
Meanwhile,
Notably, a recent study also implies the involvement of the peripheral immune system in AD pathogenesis
Specifically, by applying the proximity extension assay to plasma proteomic analysis, we investigated 280 proteins and revealed potential protein candidates (i.e., osteopontin and neurocan core protein) along with a protein network associated with AD polygenic risk-again implying global changes in plasma profiles that might be modulated by polygenic risk

POLYGENIC SCORE MODELS FOR EXAMINING THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER DISEASES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOGENESIS
The complex etiology of AD is reflected by the identification of various modifiable risk factors such as cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension, and immune factors.
Polygenic score models suggest that AD genetic risks are associated with cholesterol levels
Meanwhile, the polygenic risks for cardiovascular risk factors, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are implicated in the pathogenesis of MCI
Thus, these findings collectively suggest the underlying mechanisms of AD comorbidities and indicate possible pathways for intervention.

APPLICATIONS AND POTENTIAL ISSUES
Given the high prevalence of AD, early risk prediction might facilitate early intervention and greatly mitigate the future growth of the AD patient population.
Specifically, polygenic risk factors rooted in individual genomes can be used as biomarkers for the early assessment of relative risk at a population scale.
To illustrate the utility of such a strategy, delaying disease onset by 5 years would reduce the predicted AD population among people aged 70 years or above by 41% in the United States. in 2050
Furthermore, inspiring work by
Moreover, a recent study revealed that prior knowledge of genetic risk would also be critical for drug discovery, as drugs targeting proteins encoded in genetic risk loci would be more likely to be successful in phase II and III clinical trials
Notably, a polygenic score study of coronary heart disease risk showed that compared to people with lower genetic risk, those with higher genetic risk exhibited a greater decrease in absolute disease risk after receiving statin therapy
Therefore, conducting populationscale genetic screening for AD might simultaneously support the development of intervention strategies and enable the stratification of individuals according to their risk of AD based on their genetic patterns.
More specifically, a hierarchal screening strategy for AD risk evaluation combining genetic, circulatory factors, and brain imaging techniques can be implemented at a populational scale to facilitate disease risk screening and clinical research on personalized interventions in a genotype-aware manner (Figure
Nevertheless, there are potential issues that could hinder the development and implementation of polygenic scoring in routine clinical practice.
First, policies protecting patient privacy must be carefully considered, because the results of one person's genetic test might not only indicate their own risks of certain diseases but also those of their close relatives
Second, the possible consequences of informing certain individuals about their estimated genetic FIGURE 2 | Proposed hierarchal strategy for Alzheimer's disease risk screening.
Individuals enrolled in a screening task are first examined according to genetic risk as indicated by polygenic risk analysis.
Individuals who have relatively high risk and report symptoms are referred for biomarker examination to evaluate amyloid-beta, tau (and p-tau), and neurofilament light polypeptide levels (i.e., the "ATN" panel) in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Those who exhibit altered levels of biomarkers are further referred to clinicians for cognitive assessment followed by brain imaging including magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography.
risks for certain diseases must be carefully considered, as this could have positive and/or negative outcomes.
Fortunately, after receiving brain amyloid imaging, cognitively normal people with elevated amyloid loads tend to make more changes to their lifestyle and future plans than those who do not have elevated amyloid loads
In addition, in one recent study, providing genetic test results illustrating the 3-year risk of developing AD to patients with MCI did not increase the risk of anxiety or depression
Meanwhile, different diagnostic criteria across study cohorts might introduce bias into genetics studies and the subsequent construction of polygenic score models, although this can be reduced or eliminated by further incorporating other biomarkers to refine clinical diagnosis
Furthermore, the application of polygenic score models can help refine the results of genetic analyses based on control cohorts (i.e., controls in whom the disease of interest has not been investigated in detail) by ruling out individuals at risk of developing diseases
Moreover, polygenic score models may be used to define an individual's risk of having a specific neurodegenerative disease, as studies have demonstrated that such models (or the genotyping of specific variants) can predict the risk of Parkinson's disease
In addition, polygenic score models may help estimate the effects of aging on disease risk.
Finally, conducting polygenic risk analysis requires the availability of population-specific genetic risk information at the single-variant level.
We previously showed that a polygenic score model based on the Chinese population performs poorly when applied to an AD cohort of European descent
The poor performance of that polygenic score model can be explained by the differences in the genomic structures between populations of East-Asian and European descent.
Given that there are limited AD GWASs on populations of non-European descent
