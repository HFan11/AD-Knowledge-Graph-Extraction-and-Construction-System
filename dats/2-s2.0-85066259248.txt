Investigating 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroazepino[4,3-b]indole as scaffold of butyrylcholinesterase-selective inhibitors with additional neuroprotective activities for Alzheimer's disease
Due to the role of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in acetylcholine hydrolysis in the late stages of the Alzheimer's disease (AD), inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) have been recently envisaged, besides acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, as candidates for treating mild-to-moderate AD.
Herein, synthesis and AChE/BChE inhibition activity of some twenty derivatives of 1,2,3,4,5,6hexahydroazepino[4,3-b]indole (HHAI) is reported.
Most of the newly synthesized HHAI derivatives achieved the inhibition of both ChE isoforms with IC50s in the micromolar range, with a structure-dependent selectivity toward BChE.
Apparently, molecular volume and lipophilicity do increase selectivity toward BChE, and indeed the N2-(4-phenylbutyl) HHAI derivative 15d, which behaves as a mixed-type inhibitor, resulted the most pot -fold) inhibitor toward either horse serum and human BChE.
Moreover, 15d inhibited in vitro self-induced aggregation of neurotoxic amyloiddisplayed neuroprotective effects in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, -42 and hydrogen peroxide insults.
Overall, this study highlighted HHAI as useful and versatile scaffold for developing new small molecules targeting some enzymes and biochemical pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Moreover, 15d inhibited in vitro self-induced aggregation of neurotoxic amyloid- (Aβ) peptide and displayed neuroprotective effects in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, significantly recovering (P < 0.001) cell viability when impaired by A 1-42 and hydrogen peroxide insults.
Overall, this study highlighted HHAI as useful and versatile scaffold for developing new small molecules targeting some enzymes and biochemical pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the prevailing neurodegenerative and devastating disorder, which accounts for most elderly-related dementias.
As summarized in World Alzheimer Report 2018
The histopathological hallmarks of AD are deposition of extracellular neurotoxic amyloid-β (A) peptide aggregates that, with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated -protein, generates senile plaques, by triggering oxidative stress, perturbation of cellular metabolism, and finally synaptic and neuronal loss.
In addition, a lower level of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into hippocampus, and progressively into the whole brain cortex, typically contributes to the AD-related cognitive and memory impairment and decline
Despite the efforts (and financial resources employed as well) aimed at identifying diseasemodifying molecules, only few drugs have been approved for the symptomatic treatment of mild-tomoderate AD (Chart 1), which include the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors rivastigmine
Galantamine (2) and donepezil (3) are reversible ChE inhibitors, whereas rivastigmine (1) is a pseudo-irreversible inhibitor that transfers a carbamate moiety to the catalytic serine residue (followed by slow hydrolysis) in the active sites of both AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).
Regarding memantine
ACh is mainly hydrolyzed by AChE in the synaptic cleft of the cholinergic neurons, but at higher concentrations it could be also hydrolyzed by BChE, an -glycoprotein produced in liver and primarily distributed in plasma but also detected in central and peripheral nervous systems.
Plasma BChE may be likely responsible for detoxification of xenobiotics
In healthy brain AChE is the main enzyme responsible for ACh regulation, whereas in brain areas of AD patients, a decline of AChE level and a significant increase (30-60%) of BChE expression and activity have been observed
Overall, this evidence suggests a role of BChE in AD progression, and then the importance of developing inhibitors targeting BChE, endowed with other neuroprotective activities, as useful drugs for treating AD
AChE and BChE share about 70% of structural homology but differ in their three-dimensional structures.
AChE contains a 20 Å deep and narrow gorge, and five regions are involved in the ligand binding: (i) the catalytic triad residues (Ser203, His447, Glu334, human species numbering);
(ii) the 'oxyanion hole' inside the active center, that stabilizes the transient tetrahedral enzymesubstrate complex; (iii) the 'anionic site' (AS), where Trp86 (conserved in both ChEs) is involved in the orientation and stabilization of trimethylammonium head of ACh, through cation-π interactions; (iv) the 'acyl pocket' interacting with the substrate acyl group; (v) the 'peripheral anionic site' (PAS), located on the rim of the active site gorge
The main differences between AChE and BChE occur in the 'acyl pocket' and PAS, where two Phe residues (Phe295, Phe297) in the AChE 'acyl pocket', which prevent the access of bulkier molecules to the catalytic site, are replaced by two aliphatic residues (Leu286, Val288) in BChE.
Furthermore, six out of the fourteen aromatic residues lining the AChE gorge rim and PAS are replaced by aliphatic residues in BChE.
Consequently, the BChE cavity is about 200 Å 3 larger than the AChE gorge
Besides their catalytic function, both enzymes exhibit several noncholinergic (nonenzymatic) functions, related in AD physiopathology.
Indeed, both enzymes proved to be involved in processes leading to formation and deposition of Aβ fibrils
The peripheral site of AChE interacts with Aβ protein, by enhancing its deposition and aggregation.
In contrast, limited knowledge has been reported on mechanism linking amyloidogenesis and BChE, even if a putative role has been associated to plaques formation and maturation.
Indeed, BChE was found to be colocalized with A into the senile plaques
Chart 2)
Selective BChE inhibitors usually contain polycyclic structures
Previously, some of us reported efficient syntheses of partially hydrogenated pyrrole-and indole-fused azaheterocycles with six-to-eight-membered ring size
More recently, some N 6 -substituted partially hydrogenated azepino
Azepino-indoles could be considered homologues of carbazoles and carbolines, exploited as binder moieties in a number of dual-site AChE inhibitors, and multitarget-directed ligands (MTDL) addressing the pathogenic pathways underlying AD.
In particular, the 2,3,4,5-tetrahydroazepino
Unfortunately, the lactam derivative 6 suffered from low aqueous solubility, whereas its reduction to the more soluble amino derivative did decrease BChE inhibition potency and increase toxicity toward neuronal cells.
Herein, with the aim of better characterizing the azepino
The most active ChE inhibitors were then evaluated as A-antiaggregating agent and neuroprotectant against Aβ and oxidative stress insults in neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y).

Results and discussion

Chemistry
Compounds 8a-c, 12a-b, and 13b-c were previously published or prepared using known procedures
The HHAI compounds 8a-c were prepared by reduction of respective lactam derivatives 7a-c
The azepine intermediates 8a-c were treated with formaldehyde, and the N-formyl were catalytically reduced to yield the N-methyl derivatives 12a-b
Compounds 8a-c, reacted with suitable benzoyl-or phenylalkanoyl chlorides, leading to compounds 9-11.
A reduction reaction, followed by crystallization of the HHAIs as hydrochloride salts, led to 13a-h, 15a and 15c-d in satisfactory yields.
For preparing the N 6 -methyl derivative 15b, the phenylacetyl amide 9e underwent reaction with MeI and TBAB in a biphasic mixture (1:1 v/v of DCM/25% NaOH) to yield 14a, which was in turn reduced to 15b with LiAlH 4 .

Inhibition of cholinesterases
The in vitro inhibitory activity of the investigated compounds toward electric eel (ee) AChE and horse serum (hs) BChE were determined by the Ellman colorimetric assay
The half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC 50 ) are summarized in Tables
Compounds 8a-c and 12a-b (Table
No HHAI derivative resulted in vitro more potent than the standard references 2 and 3 toward AChE.
Except for the N 2 -Me derivative 12a, all these compounds showed a preference toward BChE, with inhibition potencies in the low micromolar range.
A net increase of ChEs' inhibition activity was achieved by introducing benzyl groups on the azepine nitrogen (Table
The effect of N 2 -benzyl groups, also bearing substituents exerting opposite electronic effects, were stronger on BChE than on AChE inhibition.
Higher inhibitory activity and ten-fold BChE selectivity ratio was attained by 13d (R 3 = 4'-CH 3 ) and 13e (R 3 = 4'-F).
In contrast with the 9-methyl derivative (13b), the insertion of fluorine on C-9 (13c, BChE IC 50 2.13 µM) did not improve BChE inhibition potency, whereas diminished the selectivity ratio (13c vs 13a).
Among the 9-F congeners, the replacement of 4'-F (13f) with the basic 4'-N,N'diethylamino-methyl group (13g) did slightly increase the BChE (and not AChE) inhibition potency.
This might be due to similar withdrawing effect exerted by fluorine and N,N'diethylamino-methyl group protonated at physiological pH, even if the volume and lipophilicity of alkylamino group seems to play a role, as accounted for the lower activity of the pyrrolidine-methyl congener 13h.
A SAR comparison (Table
The effect on ChEs' inhibition potency of the length of alkyl chain in N 2 -phenylalkyl HHAI derivatives, as expressed as the number of CH 2 units (n), was finally explored (Table
The AChE inhibition activity remained unchanged (n = 1, 2) or decreased (n = 3, 4), whereas BChE inhibition enhanced by increasing the alkyl chain length till 3-4 CH 2 units.
The methylation of the indole nitrogen in 15b did not significantly affect ChE inhibition (IC 50 s close to those of 15a).
Fig.
The mechanism of the BChE inhibition of the most potent hsBChE inhibitor 15d was studied.
The Lineweaver-Burk curves were outlined using a fixed amount of BChE and varying concentrations of the substrates between 25 and 300 M, in the absence or presence of inhibitor at different concentrations (0.1-0.5 M).
Binding of 15d to BChE changed both V max and K m values, a trend that is generally ascribed to mixed-type inhibition (Fig.
A replot of the slopes versus the corresponding inhibitor concentrations provided a K i value of 0.098 M.
The inhibitory activity of 15d was also evaluated against human (hu) ChEs, which share > 80% homology with eeAChE and hsBChE (Table

Molecular modeling
The binding mode of compound 15d to huBChE was investigated by molecular docking simulation.
As shown in Fig.
The HHAI moiety is oriented towards the top of the choline-binding site via a parallel π-stacking engaging the indole moiety of the ligand and the aromatic side chain of Trp82, whereas the pending 4-phenylbutyl group is laying on the bottom of the acyl-binding pocket through an edge-to-face π-stacking with  The same docking calculation protocol was applied to simulate the binding mode of 15d to huAChE.
The observed selectivity was substantially justified by docking results (see Supp.
Info.), which showed lower stabilizing interactions with Trp286 in huAChE.

Additional anti-AD properties 2.5.1. A 1-40 aggregation assay
In current approaches, small molecules able to inhibit ChEs and A aggregation/neurotoxicity simultaneously may have therapeutic potential as anti-AD agents
Herein, the most potent BChE-selective inhibitors (Table
Quercetin, as strong in vitro inhibitor of Aβ aggregation, was used as positive control.
All the tested compounds, significantly less active than quercetin, behaved as moderate inhibitors of A aggregation, with % inhibition at 100 µM concentration between 38 and 54%, without apparent dependence upon the length N 2 -phenylalkyl group (Fig.
Several aza-heterocyclic derivatives endowed with in vitro antiaggregating activity were reported in literature, and the anti-Aβ pharmacophore consists in a planar heterocyclic scaffold (that is the intercalating moiety for β-sheet disruption) suitably decorated with small polar and H-bonding groups (OH, OMe, etc.)
Most likely, compared to quercetin and heterocyclic analogs, the lower activity of the HHAI derivatives may be mainly due to the lack of OH groups in suitable positions.
Cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress cell damage was also investigated in H 2 O 2 -induced oxidation SH-SY5Y cell model (Fig.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by means of a spectrofluorometric measure of the fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH)
Quercetin, a well-known natural antioxidant, was used as reference compound.
15d, an effect which should not be surprising, considering that tertiary amines, like 15d, react in aqueous solvents with peroxides leading to formation of quaternary N-oxides
The aqueous solubility of compound 15d (as well as 15a and 15c), experimentally measured
The same compounds were predicted by the 'admetSAR' software
Physicochemical descriptors and ADMET parameters are reported in Supporting Information.

Conclusions
About twenty derivatives of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroazepino
A structure-activity relationship study, mostly exploring substitutions at the azepine nitrogen with groups having different size and lipophilicity, led to find out N 2 -phenylalkyl HHAI derivatives
The most potent N 2 -phenylbutyl compound 15d behaved as a mixed-type inhibitor and showed in vitro inhibitory activity (IC 50 ca.
0.2 µM) and selectivity (> 100-fold) also towards human BChE.
Molecular docking calculation of 15d into the binding site of BChE suggested π-stacking interactions (involving Trp82 and Trp231) and two hydrogen bonds (with Thr120 side chain and His438 carbonyl in the backbone) as important for the good inhibitory activity.
Finally, 15d exhibited significant (P < 0.001) protection activity on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line against cytotoxicity induced by A 42 peptide and oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide).
Taking these properties into account, the HHAI moiety can be considered a useful template for developing new molecules inhibiting BChE, which is a promising drug target in advanced AD. Compound 15d, showing additional anti-Aβ and anti-oxidative stress in neuronal cell culture, can be a candidate for advancing in molecular optimization and in vivo pharmacological studies aimed at assessing its potential as MTDL in the management of multifactorial AD-related neurodegeneration.

5.01).
AChE inhibitory activity was determined similarly, by using a solution of AChE (0.415 U/mL in 0.1 M pH 8.0 PB), and acetylthiocholine iodide (0.05 mM) as the substrate.
The inhibition data are reported as means of IC 50 's determined at least in three independent measurements.
To determine the type of inhibition for the most potent BChE inhibitor 15d, the Lineweaver-Burk eq (1/v vs 1/[S]) was fitted for varying concentrations of substrates (25-300 μM) in the absence or presence of inhibitor at four different concentrations, ranging from 0.5 to 0.1 M, and by using fixed amounts of enzymes (0.18 UmL -1 ).
Replotting the slopes of the above plots against the inhibitor 15d concentration (0.5 M, r 2 = 0.990; 0.25 M, r 2 = 0.977; 0.1 M, r 2 = 0.978; no inhibitor, r 2 = 0.978) yielded the K i value as the X-axis intercept.

Inhibition of A 1-40 aggregation
The spectrofluorimetric assays, measuring ThT fluorescence in the presence of A, were done as previously described
Briefly, samples of A were co-incubated with test molecules in PBS at 100 M concentration containing 2% v/v of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol and the antiaggregating activities were measured after 2 h of incubation at 25 °C in 96-well black, nonbinding microplates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany).
Fluorimetric reads were performed in a multiplate reader Infinite M1000 Pro (Tecan, Cernusco sul Naviglio, Italy).
Each concentration point was run in triplicate.

Cell viability and neuroprotection assay
Cytoprotection from A 42 -induced neurotoxicity was assessed in SH-SY5Y cells as already described
At least three independent experiments with six replicates were carried out, and the results were averaged.
SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM/L, 100 g/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin, at 37°C in 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
For cell assays, after grown to 70% confluence, cells were trypsinized using Trypsin-EDTA 1X in PBS (Aurogene) and plated in 96-well plates at a density of 10 000 cells per well in 125 μL of cell culture medium.
To test compound 15d for the ability to inhibit Aβ 1-42 -induced toxicity, compound 15d stock solution were prepared, and diluted with Aβ 5.01; values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Measurements of reactive oxygen species
Intracellular ROS production was evaluated using an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA; Sigma).
Viable SHSY5Y cells were seeded in a black 96well cell culture plate (PerkinElmer USA) for 24 h, and then incubated in DMEM supplemented with different concentration (ranging from 0 to 100 μM ) of compound 15d for 1 h.
After removal of buffer containing 15d, and washing, DCFH-DA (50 μM final concentration) in medium without serum was added directly to each well, and the plate was incubated 30 min at 37 °C (5% CO 2 ).
After washing using PBS, 100 μM H 2 O 2 /well in PBS was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min.
The formation of fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) due to oxidation of DCFH in the presence of ROS, was read directly in each well at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm using a multilabel plate counter Victor3 V (PerkinElmer).
DMSO medium was used for control cells.

chain.
The lack or greater weakness of the aromatic interaction of the N 2 -benzyl derivative 13a may explain, at least in part, its lower inhibitory potency with respect to 15d toward huBChE, as also supported by Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) calculation (see Supp.
Info).
In addition, two hydrogen bonds further stabilize the ligand-enzyme complex; the first between the positively charged N-2 of 15d (with assistance of a water molecule) and the Oγ of Thr120, and the second one between the indole NH and C=O of His438 in the backbone.
It is worth noting that the highest-scored docking pose of 15d resembles, regarding the location HHAI moiety, that observed in the X-ray complex of tacrine with BChE (pdb code: 4BDS; Supp.

solution in DMEM and the mixture were added quickly to cells to final concentration of 5 μM for both compound 15d and Aβ 1-42 .
SH-SY5Y cell viability was determined using a conventional MTT reduction assay, based on the ability of viable cells to metabolize 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), a water-soluble salt (yellow color), by cellular oxidoreductase into a waterinsoluble blue formazan product.
Viable cells were incubated with the mixture, and at the end of incubation time (24h, 48 h), the culture medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with a solution of MTT in PBS (50 mg/ml final concentration).
After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 , this solution was removed and 125 l of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the product formazan.
Absorbance values at 570 nm were measured using a multilabel plate counter Victor3 V (PerkinElmer), with DMSO medium as the blank solution.
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.
Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison tests (Dunnett's test) using the statistical package in the GraphPad Prism software vers.
