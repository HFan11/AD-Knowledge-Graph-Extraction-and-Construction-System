Acute neuropathological consequences of short-term mechanical ventilation in wild-type and Alzheimer’s disease mice
Background: Mechanical ventilation is strongly associated with cognitive decline after critical illness.
This finding is particularly evident among older individuals who have pre-existing cognitive impairment, most commonly characterized by varying degrees of cerebral amyloid-β accumulation, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction.
We sought to test the hypothesis that short-term mechanical ventilation contributes to the neuropathology of cognitive impairment by (i) increasing cerebral amyloid-β accumulation in mice with preexisting Alzheimer's disease pathology, (ii) increasing neurologic and systemic inflammation in wild-type mice and mice with pre-existing Alzheimer's disease pathology, and (iii) increasing hippocampal blood-brain barrier permeability in wild-type mice and mice with pre-existing Alzheimer's disease pathology.
Methods: We subjected double transgenic Alzheimer's disease (APP/PSEN1) and wild-type mice to mechanical ventilation for 4 h and compared to non-mechanically ventilated Alzheimer's disease model and wild-type mice.
Cerebral soluble/insoluble amyloid-β 1-40 /amyloid-β 1-42 and neurological and systemic markers of inflammation were quantified.
Hippocampal blood-brain barrier permeability was quantified using a novel methodology that enabled assessment of small and large molecule permeability across the blood-brain barrier.
Results: Mechanical ventilation resulted in (i) a significant increase in cerebral soluble amyloid-β 1-40 (p = 0.007) and (ii) significant increases in neuroinflammatory cytokines in both wild-type and Alzheimer's disease mice which, in most cases, were not reflected in the plasma.
There were (i) direct correlations between polymorphonuclear cells in the bronchoalveolar fluid and cerebral soluble amyloid-β 1-40 (p = 0.0033), and several Alzheimer's disease-relevant neuroinflammatory biomarkers including cerebral TNF-α and IL-6; (iii) significant decreases in blood-brain barrier permeability in mechanically ventilated Alzheimer's disease mice and a trend towards increased blood-brain barrier permeability in mechanically ventilated wild-type mice.

Background
Mechanical ventilation is considered a life-saving critical care intervention that is implemented in nearly 800,000 patients annually in the USA
It is now recognized that up to 40% of these patients acquire new and significant cognitive impairment that often resembles the phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition characterized by cerebral amyloid β (Aβ) peptide accumulation, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction
It is also known that the risk for cognitive decline after critical illness is particularly high in individuals with pre-existing cognitive impairment, of which AD is the most common type
It has been hypothesized that mechanical ventilation may contribute to long-term cognitive impairment by promoting cerebral accumulation of the Aβ peptide, systemic and neurologic inflammation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction although the exact mechanisms remain unknown
To our knowledge, no prior studies have examined the effects of mechanical ventilation in models of AD, which is relevant since most patients who undergo mechanical ventilation are elderly, and thus at higher risk for carrying increased cerebral Aβ pathology
Accordingly, in this study, we sought to test the following hypotheses: (i) short-term injurious mechanical ventilation increases cerebral Aβ accumulation in the double transgenic APP SWE /PSEN1 ΔE9 (ADtg) mouse models of AD, (ii) short-term mechanical ventilation increases systemic and neurologic inflammation in wild-type and ADtg mice, and (iii) short-term mechanical ventilation increases blood-brain barrier permeability of small or large-size molecules in wild-type and ADtg mice.

Methods
Mice Double transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (ADtg) from the B6Cg-Tg (APP SWE , PSEN1 ΔE9 ) 85Dbo/J strains, and their sex-and age-matched non-transgenic wild-type littermates, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (MMRC stock #34832-JAX|APP/PS1), then bred and maintained at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in common environmental conditions.
ADtg mouse model harbors both the chimeric mouse/human APP (APP SWE ) and the mutant human presenilin 1 (PSEN1 ΔE9 ) genes
A total of 41 mice (4 to 6.5 months old and 24.1 to 29.7 g in weight)
were used: 21 ADtg mice and 20 wild-type mice.
Of the ADtg mice, 12 were mechanically ventilated and 9 were not mechanically ventilated (spontaneous breathing) and of the 20 wild-type mice, 8 were mechanically ventilated and 12 were not mechanically ventilated.
All experiments were conducted in accordance with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines under an approved protocol and complied with the current US law.

Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from a tail or ear tip using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Mice used in this study were genotyped for the presence of the transgenes by PCR, as previously described

Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Mice to be mechanically ventilated were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of a mix of ketamine (Vedco Inc., Saint Joseph, MO, USA) and dexmedetomidine (Pfizer, Irvine, CA, USA) (75 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively).
Mice were orotracheally intubated and ventilated for 4 h using an Inspira volume-controlled small animal ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) with a tidal volume of 15 ml/kg and a respiratory rate of 70 breaths per minute, with zero PEEP.
Subcutaneous PBS (500 μl) was administered at the onset of mechanical ventilation and every 3 h of mechanical ventilation thereafter.
Fifty milligrams per kilogram of ketamine was administered as subcutaneous injections as needed, usually every 2-3 h.
Mice were kept warm on a 38 °C heating pad (Hallowell EMC, Pittsfield, MA, USA).
Anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole (1 mg/kg in 100 μL of sterile water), and the animals were allowed to recover in their cages on a heating pad for 6 h.
Control mice remained in their cages until the end of mechanical ventilation, at which time they were euthanized together with the ventilated mice.

Pulse oximetry
Arterial oxygen saturations were measured in mechanically ventilated mice using the MouseOX pulse oximeter (STARR Life Sciences, Oakmont, PA, USA).

Tracer infusion to assess BBB permeability
Following mechanical ventilation, mice recovered for 6 h after which each was administered 50 μL of intravenous Texas Red-dextran 3 kD (0.25%) and FITC-dextran 2000 kD (0.25%) via tail vein and subsequently euthanized by perfusion 30 min later.
Non-mechanically ventilated control animals also underwent tracer infusion and euthanasia by perfusion 30 min later.

Isolation of brain tissue and blood collection
At experimental completion, mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold saline supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA.
Blood was collected directly from the vena cava prior to cardiac perfusion.
The left hindbrains were collected and stored at -80 °C for further protein analysis, and the right hemispheres were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and cryo-protected in 30% sucrose for further histological analysis.
For the latter, 30-μm-thick coronal brain sections were prepared.

Bronchoalveolar lavage
Immediately after sacrificing the animal by perfusion, the trachea was exposed and cannulated with a 22-G intravenous cannula.
PBS (0.5 ml) with 2 mM EDTA was instilled and aspirated twice.
Cells were separated from the supernatant and immediately analyzed for cell counts.

Primary endpoint: cerebral Aβ quantification using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Fresh frozen left hindbrains were thoroughly homogenized in PBS buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail set I (Calbiochem), then processed as previously described
After determination of protein concentration using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific), concentrations of Aβ 1-42 and Aβ 1-40 in the soluble and insoluble brain protein fractions were analyzed with sandwich ELISA kit (Invitrogen), per manufacturer's instructions.
The optical density of each well was read at 450 nm using the same microplate reader (Spectra Max 384 plus, Molecular Devices).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Paraformaldehyde-fixed cryo-sections of the coronal brain were treated for 30 min in antigen-retrieval solution (Dako) prior to serum-free protein blocking (Dako Cytomation).
Sections were then hybridized with various primary antibodies (overnight at 4 °C): mouse anti-human Aβ [residues 1-16, mAb clone 6E10 (1:100; Covance)], rat anti-GFAP pAb (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich), and rabbit anti-CD31 pAb (1:50; Abcam).
Hybridization with primary antibodies was followed by incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 h at 37 °C; donkey anti-mouse, antirat, and anti-rabbit; 1:200; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) conjugated with Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5.
Sections were mounted using ProLong Gold with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies).
Negative controls were processed using the same protocol with the omission of the primary antibody to assess non-specific labeling.
A Carl Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 fluorescence microscope equipped with ApoTome (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) was used for microscopic analysis.
AxioVision (release 4.6.3)
software (Carl Zeiss) was used to process and analyze the images.
Secondary measure: systemic and cerebral inflammatory biomarkers quantification using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) multiplex inflammatory assay MSD V-PLEX proinflammatory panel I and cytokine panel 1 (mouse) are highly sensitive multiplex ELISA which measures quantitatively 19 cytokines (interferon γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-9, MCP-1, IL-33, IL-27p28/IL-30, IL-15, IL-17A/F, MIP-1α, IP-10, and MIP-2) using electrochemiluminescence detection technology (Meso Scale Discovery [MSD], Rockville, MD, USA).
Both plasma and brain tissue lysates were prepared according to MSD protocol and were measured in duplicate: 50 μl of twofold diluted samples and calibrators were pipetted in each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking.
Following washing the plates three times with wash buffer (1× PBS and 0.05% Tween20), 25ul of MSD detection antibody solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking.
Plates were washed three times with wash buffer and then 150 μl of MSD Read Buffer was added to each well.
The plates then were read and analyzed by the MSD instrument (MESO Quicklex S 120).

Secondary measure: fluorescent tracer quantification to assess blood-brain barrier permeability
Blood-brain barrier permeability was assessed using confocal microscopy to assess extravasation of Texas Red-dextran (3 kD) and FITC-dextran (2000 kD) tracer injected 30 min prior perfusion (0.25% each; see above).
Five consecutive hippocampal sections were imaged per mouse using FLV10 FluoView microscope at exposure DAPI 0.0133, GFP 1.240, and Texas Red 15.49.
Quantification was achieved in ImageJ (NIH) by selecting regions of interest in the hippocampus.
For FITC channel images, the background was subtracted to 10 pixels, the contrast was set to 10-60, and the threshold at 15-255.
For Texas Red images, the contrast was set at 12-50 first, and then background subtraction to 5 pixels followed by thresholding at 50-255.
Data of area fraction (%) was summed for each animal and then averaged per treatment group.

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism vr.
7.01 (Graph-Pad) Software.
Two-way ANOVA was used to compare mean differences between two or more groups when potential interactions with independent variables, such as genotype or time, could affect the measured outcomes.
Following two-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak's post hoc test was applied to assess pairwise comparisons between experimental groups while correcting for multiple comparisons.
Unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were used in two-group comparisons for matched experimental groups.
ADtg mice were age-and sex-matched (n = 6-9 mice/ group) to enable comparisons of Aβ concentrations and blood-brain barrier permeability.
The statistical association between two or more variables was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) test (GraphPad Prism), with corrections for multiple analyses.
Pearson's r indicates direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables.
Results are shown as means ± standard errors of the mean (SEMs).
Degrees of significance between groups are represented as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Post hoc Bonferroni adjustment was performed to correct for multiple comparisons for the neuroinflammatory biomarker data and altered the threshold for significance to P < 0.0028.
Only the laboratory staff member performing the experimental intervention was aware of the experimental group allocations.
Data analysts were provided with coded identifiers and remained blinded to experimental group allocations until after completion of all analyses.

Results
An overview of the experimental timeline is shown in Fig.
ADtg mice (n = 12; mean age 4.9 ± 0.8 months and weight 26.2 ± 2.9 g) and wild-type mice (n = 8; mean age 5.3 ± 0.8 months and weight 26.3 ± 3.7 g) underwent mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 15 ml/kg for 4 h, while control groups of non-mechanically ventilated ADtg mice (n = 9; mean age 4.9 ± 1.8 months and weight 27.8 ± 3.2 g) and WT mice (n = 12; mean age 5.7 ± 1.1 months and weight 27.5 ± 1.2 g) were not mechanically ventilated.
There were no significant differences in age or weight between any of the groups (p > 0.05).
There was a decrease in mean oxygen saturation during the 4 h of mechanical ventilation in both ADtg and wild-type mice.
In addition, the mean oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the wild-type mice compared to the ADtg mice (Fig.
Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell percent was measured in the bronchoalveolar fluid to assess the extent of pulmonary inflammation due to mechanical ventilation and was significantly increased in the mechanically ventilated wild-type and ADtg mice (Fig.
We then quantified soluble Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 peptides, which are closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD
There was a significant increase in cerebral concentrations of soluble Aβ 1-40 in age-and sex-matched ADtg mice subjected to mechanical ventilation compared to those who did not undergo mechanical ventilation (Fig.
There was a non-statistically significant increase in soluble Aβ 1-42 of ADtg mice subjected to mechanical ventilation compared to those who did not undergo mechanical ventilation (Fig.
Figure
In comparison to the non-mechanically ventilated mice, mechanically ventilated mice demonstrated significant increases in cerebral IL-6 and TNF-α in both mice strains (Fig.
There was a significant increase in IL-5 in mechanically ventilated wild-type mice and a significant increase in IL-10 in mechanically ventilated ADtg mice (Fig.
There was a trend towards increased plasma IL-6 following mechanical ventilation in both mice strains while plasma IL-1β increased significantly in the wild-type mice only (Fig.
In contrast, there was no significant change in plasma TNF-α following mechanical ventilation and no significant correlation with cerebral TNF-α (Fig.
There were direct and significant correlations between (i) PMN percent in the bronchoalveolar fluid and cerebral IL-6, TNF-α, IL-5, and IL-10 concentrations (Fig.
There were significant interactions between genotype and mechanical ventilation for cerebral IL-5, IL-10, and plasma IL-1β (indicated by p i in Fig.
Other significant interactions can be found in Additional file 2.
Assessment of potential relationships between cerebral Aβ concentrations and cognition-relevant cytokines in ADtg mice revealed direct and significant correlations between (i) cerebral TNF-α and soluble Aβ 1-40 (Fig.
There was no significant association between cerebral IL-10 and soluble Aβ 1-42 and cerebral IL-1β and soluble Aβ 1-42 (Fig.
Alterations in blood-brain barrier function are implicated in AD and were, thus, assessed by quantifying permeability of small (Texas Red-dextran 3 kD) and large (FITC-dextran 2000 kDa) molecules as evaluated by histology.
Although there was a large variability in the sample data for FITC-dextran and Texas Red-dextran (Fig.
There was a significant interaction between genotype and mechanical ventilation on the measured outcome of Texas Red-dextran 3 kD permeability (Fig.

Discussion
In this study, we found strong correlations between acute pulmonary inflammation after short-term mechanical ventilation and cerebral accumulation of soluble Aβ 1-40 , cerebral inflammation, and blood-brain barrier permeability.
These data suggest that mechanical ventilation acutely promotes AD neuropathology by (i) increasing cerebral accumulation of the Aβ peptide and AD-associated neuroinflammation, notably TNF-α and IL-6 in ADtg mice with pre-existing AD pathology, and (ii) increasing AD-associated neuroinflammation, notably TNF-α and IL-6, and possibly blood-brain barrier permeability in wild-type mice without pre-existing AD pathology.
These findings provide mechanistic insights into the well-documented clinical observations that associate mechanical ventilation with long-term cognitive decline and AD in particular
The non-significant trend towards increased blood-brain barrier permeability in the wild-type mice also suggests the presence of a common pathophysiology that contributes to both delirium, which is independently associated with accelerated cognitive decline, and AD
Further, the finding that soluble Aβ 1-40 , the most abundant Aβ isoform, increases with mechanical ventilation is noteworthy because prior studies have shown that soluble Aβ species significantly contribute to AD pathogenesis and even more so than insoluble Aβ aggregates
Although causation is not yet proven through direct experimentation, the results of this investigation are consistent with prior studies that report a role for cerebral TNF-α in promoting cerebral Aβ accumulation
This suggests that acute cerebral Aβ accumulation may be independent of systemic  TNF-α concentrations and that mechanical ventilation or pulmonary inflammation may directly contribute to neuroinflammation, perhaps via local cerebral signaling mechanisms or by inducing alterations in Aβ clearance from the brain
Our approach to assessing blood-brain barrier dysfunction involved in vivo administration of high (FITC-dextran 2000 kD) and low (Texas Red-dextran 3 kD) molecular weight tracers 30 min prior to sacrifice, followed by tissue extraction and histological analysis.
Notably, the molecular weight of Aβ 1-42 is approximately 4.4 kD and is thus closely approximated by the size of the Texas Red-dextran 3 kD tracer influx that was used in this study
This approach allowed us to reveal the complex relationships between mechanical ventilation, cerebral Aβ accumulation, and blood-brain barrier permeability.
Our results show a trend towards increased hippocampal blood-brain barrier permeability in the wild-type animals, which suggests that short-term mechanical ventilation may impair the function of neuroanatomical structures responsible for cognition in otherwise healthy brains.
Since the bloodbrain barrier plays a central role in maintaining normal cognition via clearance of Aβ and maintaining cerebral small vessel integrity, these findings suggest that mechanical ventilation may initiate neuropathology that leads to long-term cognitive impairment
Paradoxically, the ADtg mice showed significantly decreased blood-brain barrier permeability despite increased cerebral Aβ 1-40 concentration.
These unexpected results may suggest that Aβ exerts a protective effect that limits the influx of toxins from the vascular space into the brain parenchyma across the blood-brain barrier.
Future studies are needed to assess whether leakage of tracer is more restricted in regions where Aβ are aggregated and to clarify whether this is related to altered expression of Aβ receptors or transporters within the blood-brain barrier.
This study has important limitations that should be considered.
Although these data indicate statistical significance in three principal components of cognitive impairmentnamely, accumulation of cerebral soluble Aβ 1-40 , increase in key cognition-relevant inflammatory biomarkers, and alteration of blood-brain barrier permeability-it is possible that future studies with larger sample sizes could reveal additional significant effects of mechanical ventilation on other Aβ isoforms that are less abundant than soluble Aβ 1-40.
Conversely, it is also possible that the trend towards increased blood-brain brain permeability in the wild-type mice reverses with larger sample sizes, notwithstanding the biological plausibility of increased blood-brain barrier permeability in systemic and systemic inflammatory conditions
Additionally, as there were significant interactions between genotype and mechanical ventilation for cerebral IL-5, IL-10, and Texas Red-dextran 3 kD permeability, future studies should be designed to identify genotype-specific variables that may have influenced these outcomes.
Another potential limitation is the use of high dose of mechanical ventilation, i.e., 15 cc/kg tidal volumes, which may not reflect current clinical practice where lower tidal volume ventilation is generally considered the standard of care.
However, these animals were also healthier and did not have any concurrent systemic infections or exposure to high doses of sedatives that could have increased the overall medical acuity.
Subsequent research is needed to determine whether lower tidal volume ventilation decreases the burden of neurological injury or whether superimposed effects of systemic diseases such as sepsis alter the extent of neurological injury.
Although the young mice used in this experiment do not necessarily reflect the demographic of older intensive care patients who undergo mechanical ventilation.
The use of these animals with less baseline AD-pathology allowed us to clearly demonstrate the accelerated trajectory of AD-relevant neuropathology.
Future studies are needed to study the effects of mechanical ventilation in older mice.
To simulate the real-life application of mechanical ventilation, the animals who underwent mechanical ventilation received sedation, while the non-mechanically ventilated animals did not receive sedation.

For Pearson's r correlations, both r and p values, as well as 95% CI dashed lines are presented could alter respiratory drive and lead to additional confounding variables, such as hypoxemia or hypercapnia, which could independently alter cerebrovascular hemodynamics and the measured outcomes.
We, thus, opted to avoid this effect of sedation in our control animals.
The issue of sedation remains challenging and one that will need to be clarified in future investigations that strive to identify the independent effects of sedatives on the measured outcomes.
Finally, the results of this study must be interpreted with caution as findings from pre-clinical studies are not invariably confirmed in clinical trials, and although significant efforts were made to minimize introduction of bias, including the use of blinded data analysts and concealed experimental group allocation, it may not be possible to fully eliminate the introduction of bias.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our data indicate that short-term mechanical ventilation, a common critical care intervention, promotes neuropathology that is a characteristic of AD by increasing cerebral soluble Aβ 1-40 , promoting neuroinflammation, and altering blood-brain barrier permeability.
Future studies are needed to further clarify specific molecular mechanisms that underlie these findings that will facilitate the development of neuroprotective mechanical ventilation strategies that could mitigate the risk of cognitive decline after critical illness.
