Background
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common subtype of dementia which is officially listed as the sixth leading cause of death worldwide.
Recent estimates indicate that AD ranks third behind heart disease and cancer as the major cause of death in the elderly
AD is characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Ab) plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the neocortical and limbic regions of the brain
As a group of unknown primary degenerative and an irreversible progressive brain diseases, AD causes neuronal cell apoptosis and brain atrophy
The risk factors for the onset and development of AD closely relate to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, low neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis
It thus appears that AD is a complex disease for which suitable therapeutic approaches are not currently recognized.
Although drug development is improving, the complexity of AD makes therapeutic approaches challenging.
To improve AD therapy, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing the disease are required
To further understand the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, high-throughput gene expression data has been investigated and substantial progress has been made in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.
Network-based approaches
PPI networks can be reconstructed from protein domains, gene expression data, and structure-based information
PPI networks are altered in many disease states
An array of studies has integrated gene expression and PPI data to identify protein complexes
Transcription factor networks are also a key determinant of cell fate decisions during mammalian development and adult tissue homeostasis is disrupted in disease
The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers that influence AD prognosis.
Six gene expression profiles were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and 2514 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were initially screened.
Of the 379 DEGs identified, 68 were upregulated and 307 were downregulated identified through prediction analysis for microarray (PAM) algorithms that discriminate AD from normal samples.
Upregulated genes were significantly enriched in histone function, beta receptor signaling, cell growth, and angiogenesis.
Downregulated genes were significantly enriched in MAPK signaling, synaptic signaling, neuronal apoptosis, and Alzheimer associated pathways.
A total of 32 hub genes including ENO2, CCT2, CALM2, ACACB, ATP5B, MDH1, and PPP2CA were screened based on PPI networks and module analysis.
Of these hub genes, NFKBIA and ACACB were upregulated, whilst 29 genes were downregulated in AD patients.
These findings reveal new AD biomarkers with prognostic and therapeutic value.

Material and Methods

Data download and preprocessing
Six sets of gene expression profiles related to AD were collected from the GEO database (
geo/) including GSE1297
GSE1297 was based on the GPL96 platform, whilst others were based on GPL570.
The probes corresponding to multiple genes were removed and multiple probes corresponding to the genes were added.
Mean expression values were then assessed.
The gene sets were scored with z-score standards and extracted using shared gene sets.
The genes were then integrated into large gene expression profiles.
Finally, due to the batch effects of the GPL96 and GPL570 platforms, the removeBatchEffect function was employed from the limma package.

Screening of significant differentially expressed genes
Brain samples were collected from Alzheimer's disease Research Center (ADRC) brain banks for subsequent gene expression profiling.
All AD patients met the Alzheimer disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD.
Controls were cognitively normal healthy controls with no disease history including cardiovascular risk factors.
The limma package

Establishment of the PAM model
PAM algorithms (
The centroid methodology
The sorting approach can shrink each class centroid to an overall centroid based on the threshold values to solve data classification difficulties.
Moreover, 10-fold crossvalidations were performed to guarantee forecasting accuracy.
For the aforementioned gene integration profiles, we used limma analysis to build the PAM model and identify potential biomarkers of AD.

Gene Set enrichment analysis
The function of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the potential biomarkers was analyzed by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery.(DAVID)
(
6.7 version) with Benjamini P<0.05.
Subsequent studies involving the significant functional enrichment of GO and KEGG analysis were used in the analysis.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) enrichment analysis
We used C2 curated genes as background gene sets using the MsigDB database (
version 6.2).
The screening of upregulated and downregulated gene sets was performed using GSEA enrichment analysis, specific parameters were as follows:
• Numbers of permutations: 1000 Establishment of the PPI network "Multiple Protein" functional modules of the String database (
v10.5) were used to construct the PPI network which was further visualized using Cytoscape (version 3.6.1)
software.
Moreover, we analyzed the betweenness, tightness, degree and distribution of hub genes in the PPI network using the igraph R package.
We searched for whole functional modules through the fastest greedy algorithm and analyzed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the genes in these modules.
Hub genes in the PPI network were identified and the proteins of these hub genes were further characterized based on degree size of the network.

Transcription factor analysis
Transcription factor gene data of the RegNetwork database (
was used to characterize the transcription factor regulatory networks associated with the target genes.
The RegNetwork describes transcription factor to genes from the perspective of TransFac, TRED and JASPAR database resources.
The RegNetwork describes a more comprehensive transcription factor regulation network.
RegNetwork describes transcriptional regulation between transcription factor and target genes from the 3 database resources of TransFac, TRED, and JASPAR, and the RegNetwork's transcription factor regulation network is more comprehensive.
Amongst them, the RegNetwork database contains 149 841 transcriptional regulations between transcription factor and target gene regulatory relationships in humans.
Target and hub genes were mapped into the transcription factor regulatory network separately to obtain each transcription factor regulatory network which were visualized using Cytoscape.
Furthermore, transcription

Data downloads and preprocessing
Six sets of AD gene expression profiles were download from the GEO database.
The PAM model was built and designed and is presented in Figure

Screening of significant differentially expressed genes
We downloaded the gene expression profiles of AD including GSE1297, GSE28146, GSE4757, GSE5281, GSE48350, and GSE11882 (Table
For each set of expression profiles, probes corresponding to the multiple genes were respectively deleted, whilst for multiple probes corresponding to the same gene, the mean expression values of the probes were taken as the expression values of the genes.
Next, z-score standardization was performed for the 6 expression profiles.
A total of 12 399 shared genes from 6 expression profiles were extracted, and 6 sets of expression profiles were integrated in large gene expression profiles which contained 12 399 genes and 668 samples.
As the origin of the expression profiles were from GPL96 and GPL570 platforms, the platform differences were regarded as batch effects, and the data was further processed by the removeBatchEffect of the limma package.
In Figure
The lines between the solid origins explain that the same sample is present in both GSE11882 and GSE48350 datasets.
GSE48350 contained 173 samples of GSE11882.
Finally, we analyzed GSE1297, GSE28146, GSE4757, GSE5281, and GSE48350 datasets that included 12 399 genes, and 495 samples (394 AD and 101 normal samples).
For these samples, the demographic characteristics of the patients (sex, age, stage, etc.) are shown in Table

GSEA enrichment analysis
We selected C2 curated gene sets from the MsigDB database (
version 6.2) as background gene sets.
The upregulated and downregulated genes were analyzed by GSEA enrichment using the parameters described in the materials and methods.
Since the upregulated gene sets contained only 68 genes, the GSEA requires that the input gene sets are greater than 100.
