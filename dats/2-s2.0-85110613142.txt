Metformin activates chaperone-mediated autophagy and improves disease pathologies in an Alzheimer disease mouse model
Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomedependent selective degradation pathway implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.
However, the mechanisms that regulate CMA are not fully understood.
Here, using unbiased drug screening approaches, we discover Metformin, a drug that is commonly the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, can induce CMA.
We delineate the mechanism of CMA induction by Metformin to be via activation of TAK1-IKKα/β signaling that leads to phosphorylation of Ser85 of the key mediator of CMA, Hsc70, and its activation.
Notably, we find that amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is a CMA substrate and that it binds to Hsc70 in an IKKα/β-dependent manner.
The inhibition of CMA-mediated degradation of APP enhances its cytotoxicity.
Importantly, we find that in the APP/ PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), activation of CMA by Hsc70 overexpression or Metformin potently reduces the accumulated brain Aβ plaque levels and reverses the molecular and behavioral AD phenotypes.
Our study elucidates a novel mechanism of CMA regulation via Metformin-TAK1-IKKα/β-Hsc70 signaling and suggests Metformin as a new activator of CMA for diseases, such as AD, where such therapeutic intervention could be beneficial.

INTRODUCTION
Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is one of three types of autophagy and has been identified only in birds and mammals
CMA has been linked to many cellular processes, including metabolism, DNA repair, and T cell activation
The selectivity of CMA is due to the requirement for its substrates to contain the Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg-Gln (KFERQ) motif
The CMA substrate proteins are recruited to the lysosomes by heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8 (Hsc70), which recognizes the KFERQ motifs and delivers the substrates to the lysosomal membrane
Lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A (Lamp2a), a lysosomal receptor, mediates the translocation of CMA substrates into the lysosomal lumen, a process that is assisted by a luminal resident form of Hsc70
The mechanistic regulation of CMA is not fully understood.
No protein kinase has yet been reported to directly phosphorylate and regulate Hsc70 activity.
Dysregulation of CMA has been linked to neurodegeneration, cancer, aging, metabolic regulation, and T cell response
Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanistic regulation of CMA may pave the way for future therapeutic approaches for treating human diseases where CMA is dysregulated.
However, the lack of a safe and effective drug that can selectively activate CMA has hampered research into the therapeutic feasibility of CMA-activating strategies.
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive neuronal loss with diseasedefining Aβ peptide oligomerization and hyperphosphorylated Tau pathologies
CMA activation is suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD due to its ability to decrease Tau protein levels
However, AD-associated forms of Tau aggregate and suppress CMA by binding to Lamp2a and disrupting its lysosomal translocation
The role of CMA in regulating Aβ levels has not been described.
Aβ peptides are derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by βand γ-secretases
Inhibiting APP degradation is known to promote AD pathogenesis by facilitating Aβ production
Growing evidence indicates that aberrant modifications and trafficking of APP play crucial roles in AD pathogenesis by dysregulating APP processing and Aβ generation
Therefore, pharmacologic facilitation of APP clearance could be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AD.
Metformin is an oral drug widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
It has been used with an excellent safety record for over 60 years (Diabetes Prevention Program Research, G. Long-term safety, tolerability, and weight loss associated with metformin in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study 2012).
Metformin has been shown to play a beneficial role in many diseases such as cancers
In addition, some studies have shown that Metformin can inhibit chronic inflammation
Metformin induced activation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor, contributed to part of the mechanism, but could not explain all the effects.
The idea that Metformin exerts its pleiotropy through novel mechanisms is now increasingly supported.
In this study, we have screened 2,197 FDA-approved drugs or drug candidates and identified Metformin as a novel activator of CMA.
We demonstrate that Metformin activates IKKα/β kinases, which in turn phosphorylate Hsc70 at Ser85 and activate it.
We also find that APP is a CMA substrate and show that Metformin reduces Aβ levels and improves cognitive impairment in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD.
Finally, we find that AAV-mediated overexpression of Hsc70 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice also significantly alleviates AD pathologies.
Our findings identify Metformin as a novel inducer of CMA, discover the first reported mechanism of CMA activation downstream of TAK1-IKKα/β signaling, and suggest that CMA activation to degrade Aβ could be a putative therapeutic strategy for AD.

RESULTS

Identification of CMA activators by high-throughput screening
Hexokinase 2 (HK2), a key enzyme involved in glucose metabolism, has been shown to be a CMA substrate
In order to establish a CMA reporter system suitable for high-throughput screening, we generated a HEK293T cell line stably expressing HK2-GFP in a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible manner (henceforth, 293THK).
Treating cells with a combination of autophagy inhibitor Spautin-1 and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3) inhibitor AC220 has been previously shown to induce HK2 degradation via CMA
Consistently, a major decrease of GFP fluorescence and HK2-GFP levels were induced by this treatment, and this decrease was rescued by knockdown of the CMA mediator Hsc70 (Figs.
The mRNA levels of HK2-GFP were not affected by these treatments, confirming that the observed decrease was due to protein degradation (Fig.
These findings established that the 293THK cell line is a functional reporter system for monitoring CMA activity.
To identify CMA activators, we screened 2,197 FDA-approved drugs or drug candidates using 293THK cells and high-throughput flow cytometry and identified 195 compounds that induced a significant decrease in HK2-GFP fluorescence (Fig.
Using these hits, we performed a second round of screening, but in the presence or absence of Lamp2a knockdown (to block CMA) and identified 38 compounds that induce a decrease in HK2-GFP levels only in the absence of Lamp2a knockdown (Fig.
Notably, Metformin, a drug frequently prescribed for type 2 diabetes, was among these 38 compounds.
(E) 293THK cells were pretreated with or without 1 μg/mL DOX for 24 h, incubated with 2,197 FDA-approved drugs or drug candidates for 24 h, and the HK2-GFP fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry and compared with the fluorescence of cells treated with DMSO.
The results were presented in the form of a heatmap.
Red and blue colors represent the degree of increase and decrease of HK2-GFP levels, respectively, following drug treatments.
(F) 293THK cells were pretreated with or without 1 μg/mL DOX, transfected with siRNA (two different sequences #1 and #2) of Hsc70 for 48 h, treated with or without Metformin for another 12 h, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-Hsc70, anti-GFP, and anti-Tubulin antibodies.

Metformin activates chaperone-mediated autophagy
As shown in Fig.
We confirmed that Metformin did not affect the mRNA levels of HK2-GFP (Fig.
We also detected the dose course curve of Metformin on degradation of HK2-GFP, the degradation of HK2-GFP was accelerated following the increase dose of Metformin (Fig.
We also measured the half-life of HK2-GFP, as shown in Fig.
These results indicated that the effects of Metformin on HK2-GFP was through degradation.
Metformin also induced degradation of two endogenous CMA substrates-HK2 and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2), at both 20 mmol/L and 20 µmol/L doses of the drug (Figs.
We chose these two doses due to the robustness of the 20 mmol/L dose and due to the clinical relevance of the 20 µmol/L dose, as the Metformin serum concentrations in patients receiving this drug are ∼20 µmol/L
Metformin-induced degradation of HK2 and PKM2 was blocked by lysosomal inhibitors (E-64D, Bafilomycin A1 and Leupeptin + NH 4 Cl) but not by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 which confirming that the degradation is lysosomedependent (Figs.
Knockdown of Hsc70 and Lamp2a blocked the degradation of endogenous HK2 and PKM2, following both 20 mmol/L (Fig.
Additionally, knockdown of Hsc70 also rescued Metformininduced decrease of HK2-GFP fluorescence and HK2-GFP protein levels (Fig.
Moreover, Metformin induced interaction of endogenous HK2 and PKM2 with Hsc70-Flag (Figs.
These findings were also confirmed by a proximity ligation assay (PLA) performed for endogenous Hsc70 (Fig.
We also detected whether macroautophagy were involved in the degradation of HK2 and PKM2.
Using ATG5 knockout HEK293 cells and ATG8 knockout Hela cells, we found that knockout of ATG5 and ATG8 did not block the degradation of HK2 and PKM2 under Metformin treatment (Fig.
Overall, these experiments confirm that Metformin activates CMA, as it triggers degradation of endogenous CMA substrates in a lysosome-, Hsc70-, and Lamp2a-dependent manner and concurrently increases their interactions with Hsc70 and Lamp2a.

Metformin activates CMA via Ser85 phosphorylation of Hsc70
Metformin is a known inducer of AMPK activation
Using AMPKα1/α2 double knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, we found that the degradation of endogenous HK2 and PKM2 following Metformin treatment was independent of AMPK (Figs.
However, Metformin-induced degradation of the CMA substrates HK2 and PKM2 was lysosomedependent and proteasome-independent in these cells (Fig.
We found that Metformin-induced decrease of HK2-GFP fluorescence and protein levels were rescued by overexpression of λ-phosphatase, suggesting that a phosphorylation event is responsible for the degradation of HK2-GFP (Figs. 3C, 3D, S3B, and S3C).
We subjected Hsc70-Flag immunoprecipitated from control versus Metformin-treated cells to phosphorylation analysis by mass spectrometry and found that Ser85 phosphorylation was induced by the treatment (Fig.
Interestingly, the Metformin-induced interaction between Hsc70 and the CMA substrate proteins was significantly decreased by S85A mutation of Hsc70 (Figs.
We also tested whether S85A mutation of Hsc70 influence CMA with or without Lamp2a knockdown in H4 and HKE293T cells.
Overexpression of Hsc70-WT but not Hsc70-S85A decreased protein levels of HK2 and PKM2
Cell lysates were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.
(B) H4 cells were treated with 20 mmol/L Metformin with or without MG132 (10 μmol/L), Bafilomycin A1 (100 nmol/L), NH 4 Cl (20 mmol/L), Leupeptin (100 nmol/L), E-64D (10 μmol/L) for 12 h.
Cell lysates were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.
(C and D) H4 cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs (#1 and #2 represent two different sequences) for 48 h, treated with or without 20 mmol/L Metformin for another 12 h.
Cell lysates were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.
(E) HEK293T cells were transfected with Hsc70-Flag for 24 h, treated with or without 20 mmol/L Metformin for another 6 h, the interaction between HK2, PKM2, and Hsc70 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. (F) HEK293T cells were transfected with Lamp2a-Flag for 24 h, treated with or without 20 mmol/L Metformin for another 6 h, the interaction between HK2, PKM2, and Lamp2a were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. (G) H4 cells were treated with or without 20 mmol/L Metformin for 6 h, PLA assay for endogenous Hsc70 and PKM2 was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.

and knockdown of Lamp2a blocked these degradation (Fig.
These results suggest that the Metformin-induced activation of CMA may involve phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85, promotes interaction of Hsc70 with the CMA substrate proteins.
These findings reveal not only an unexpected effect downstream of Metformin treatment but also a previously unknown regulatory input into Hsc70 and CMA, as well as the importance of Hsc70 phosphorylation at Ser85 to promote Hsc70 interaction with CMA substrates.

Metformin activates TAK1-IKKα/β signaling
We generated a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes Hsc70 phosphorylated at Ser85 (p-Hsc70 Ser 85 ).
A strong signal was detected in HEK293T cells transfected with WT, but not S85A Hsc70, indicating that the antibody specifically recognizes Hsc70 phosphorylated at Ser85 (Fig.
We also found that Metformin treatment induced the phosphorylation of Hsc70 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
These results indicated that the phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85 is important for the activation of CMA.
Consistent with the AMPK-independent nature of the Metformin-induced CMA activation (Fig.
We found that the Ser85 of Hsc70 is predicted to be a potential IKKα/β target (see Methods section).
In vitro kinase assays using purified Hsc70 and IKKα/β revealed that Hsc70 is directly phosphorylated at Ser85 by both IKKα and IKKβ, and combination of IKKα and IKKβ further increases the phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85 (Fig.
The interaction between IKKα or IKKβ and Hsc70 was increased following Metformin treatment (Figs.
These results suggest that IKKα/β phosphorylate Hsc70 at Ser85.
To further verify the upstream kinases of Hsc70 at Ser85 is IKKα/β, we knocked down IKKα and IKKβ in 293THK cells and treated with Metformin.
Knockdown of IKKβ rescued Metformin-induced reduction of HK2-GFP fluorescence and protein levels (Figs.
Knockdown of IKKα also showed the same results (Fig.
Inhibition of IKKβ by TPCA1 also rescued the Metformin-induced decrease of HK2-GFP levels (Figs.
Furthermore, TPCA1 inhibited the Metformin-induced phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85 and inhibited Metformin-induced degradation of PKM2 (Figs.
Obviously, knockdown of IKKα or IKKβ reduced the p-Hsc70 Ser 85 levels and prevented the degradation of endogenous HK2 and PKM2 (Figs. 4G, S4I, and S5F).
Furthermore, overexpression of IKKα or IKKβ increased the levels of p-Hsc70 Ser 85 (Fig.
Overall, these experiments suggest that Metformin-induced phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85 is mediated by IKKα and IKKβ.
TAK1 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1) is known to activate IKKα/β kinases via phosphorylation at their Ser176/180 residues
Therefore, we tested whether Metformin-induced IKK and CMA activation are dependent on TAK1.
We found that knockdown of TAK1 rescued the Metformin-induced decrease of HK2-GFP levels
These findings suggest that Metformin triggers TAK1 activation, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates IKKα/β that phosphorylate Hsc70 to induce CMA.
In order to verify whether TAK1 is a direct target of Metformin for CMA activation, we detected whether Metformin has direct interaction with TAK1 by thermal shift assay in vitro.
The addition of TAK1 inhibitor 5a-7-oxozeaenol (5z7) to TAK1 decreased its melting temperature (Tm) by 8.28 °C , however, Metformin had no effect (Fig.
These results indicated that TAK1 is not the direct target of Metformin, however it involved in the activation of CMA by Metformin.

APP is a CMA substrate
CMA has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic avenue to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the ability of CMA to degrade Tau.
However, Tau aggregates are known to inhibit CMA.
Whether APP can also be degraded by CMA is not known.
Due to its importance in the pathogenesis of AD, we investigated whether APP can be targeted to degradation following CMA activation by Metformin.
Notably, Metformin induced degradation of endogenous APP proteins in SH-SY5Y cells, in a lysosome-dependent (Fig.
Metformin treatment also enhanced the interaction between endogenous APP and Hsc70-Flag, as well as Lamp2a-Flag (Fig.
Consistent with the observation that Ser85 phosphorylation of Hsc70 is important for its interaction with CMA substrates, as shown in Fig.
Notably, inhibition and knockdown of IKKβ (Fig.
Collectively, these results indicate that APP is a CMA substrate, degradation of which can be induced by Metformin via activation of the TAK1-IKKα/β-Hsc70-CMA pathway.
We found that the amino acid sequence of APP contains three putative KFERQ-like CMA motifs that are strongly conserved across species (Fig.
In order to verify that these motifs are involved in APP degradation through Metformin-activated CMA, we constructed APP mutants of the KFERQ-like motifs, as shown in Fig.
The Metformin-induced degradation of APP was not blocked by mutation of any single KFERQ-like motif.
However, mutation of two or especially three of the motifs prevented the degradation (Fig.
Importantly, the interaction of APP with endogenous Hsc70 or Lamp2a was blocked when all three CMA motifs in APP (APP-M7) were mutated (Fig.
These findings suggest that APP interacts with Hsc70 through the KFERQ-like motifs during activation of CMA.

Metformin alleviates cytotoxicity of APP and Aβ via CMA-mediated degradation
APP upregulation can promote AD pathogenesis by facilitating Aβ production.
SH-SY5Y cells can be used to detect the cell viability of overexpression of APP
We found that overexpression of APP-WT in SH-SY5Y cells reduced cell viability and that Metformin treatment rescued this cytotoxic effect.
However, this Metformininduced rescue was blocked by the mutations of the KFERQ-like motifs of APP (APP-M7), indicating that the effect of Metformin on cell viability depends on CMA-mediated degradation of APP (Fig.
Similarly, transfection of Hsc70, but not Hsc70-S85A rescued the drop in cell viability following overexpression of APP, indicating that CMA-mediated degradation of APP can rescue the cytotoxicity effect due to its aberrantly high levels (Fig.
Notably, Metformin treatment also rescued cytotoxicity caused by overexpression of the disease-causing Swedish K595N/M596L APP mutant (Fig.
Consistently, Metformin induced degradation of both wild-type and K595N/ M596L APP (Fig.
These results suggest that Metformin can prevent cytotoxicity induced by overexpression of APP and the disease-causing K595N/M596L APP mutant by targeting them to CMA-mediated degradation.
Aβ-induced neurotoxicity can be detected by the cell viability of PC12 cells incubated with Aβ
Preventing Aβ-induced neurotoxicity has been proposed as a possible strategy for therapeutic intervention in AD.
We found that Metformin blocked Aβ 25-35induced cytotoxicity in Hsc70-and Lamp2a-dependent manner in PC12 cells, suggesting the involvement of CMA in this effect (Fig.
Notably, IKKβ inhibitor TPCA1 and knockdown of TAK1 also blocked this effect of

RESEARCH ARTICLE
Metformin, consistent with our findings that TAK1-IKKα/β signaling is important for Metformin-induced activation of CMA (Fig.
These results suggest that the effect of Metformin on Aβ-induced toxicity is via the TAK1-IKKα/β-CMA signaling.
In order to differentiate at which extent Metformin promotes degradation of APP or alleviating of Aβ cytotoxicity via CMA or macroautophagy, we use siRNAs to target ATG5, and found that the alleviating of cytotoxicity which induced by overexpression of APP or Aβ by Metformin was not blocked by knockdown of ATG5 (Fig.
Knockdown of ATG5 also did not block the degradation of APP under Metformin treatment (Fig.
Overall, our findings indicate that Metformin-induced CMA activation can induce degradation of APP, disease-causing Swedish K595N/M596L APP mutant and rescue the associated cytotoxicity in cell culture.
Activation of CMA by Metformin or overexpression of Hsc70 ameliorates cognitive decline and amyloid pathologies in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD APP/PS1 mice develop AD-like cognitive deficits that can be assessed using Morris water maze test
To investigate the effect of Metformin-induced CMA activation on memory loss and AD-associated molecular pathogenesis markers, the mice were treated with water (Veh) or Metformin (Met) in drinking water for 12 weeks.
Notably, Metformin-treated APP/PS1 mice showed improved learning and spatial memory (Fig.
Moreover, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampus, as judged by GFAP staining, was also reduced upon following Metformin treatment (Fig.
Importantly, Metformin treatment also significantly reduced the protein levels of APP and induced Hsc70 phosphorylation at Ser85, consistent with our findings in cell culture (Fig.
In order to test whether activation of CMA via Hsc70 overexpression can also alleviate the APP/PS1 phenotypes, we overexpressed Hsc70-WT and Hsc70-S85A in the hippocampus of the mice (Fig.
AAV particles expressing either control vector (mCherry), Hsc70-WT, or Hsc70-S85A were injected into the hippocampus of 16-weeks-old APP/ PS1 mice, and 12 weeks later, their behavioral and molecular phenotypes were examined.
Using the Morris water maze test, we found that Hsc70-WT overexpression alleviated the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice, and the S85A mutation partially reduced that effect (Fig.
Similarly, insoluble levels of Aβ 1-42 were decreased in the whole brain tissues of APP/PS1 mice upon overexpression Hsc70-WT, but not Hsc70-S85A (Fig.
Moreover, Aβ plaque levels (Fig.
In summary, our results show that CMA activation by either Metformin treatment or overexpression of Hsc70 can decrease the insoluble Aβ 1-42 burden, Aβ plaque levels, induce degradation of APP and alleviate cognitive deficits of the APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease.

DISCUSSION
Our study identifies Metformin as a novel CMA activator, sheds light on the mechanism of CMA activation by Metformin, and identifies APP as a novel CMA substrate, suggesting that Metformin-induced CMA activation and degradation of APP and Aβ can have beneficial effects in the context of pathogenesis of the Alzheimer's disease.
We identify the TAK1-IKKα/β signaling to be the first regulatory input into the CMA pathway and show that IKKα/ β-mediated phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85 controls its ability to interact with its substrates.
Our study, thus, places drugs that target TAK1 and IKKα/β as novel inhibitors of CMA.
Future studies will determine how the TAK1-IKKα/β signaling, activated by physiological agonists such as TNFα

RESEARCH ARTICLE
Hsc70 is a constitutively-expressed protein and plays an important role in maintain and regulating cellular functions
The structure of Hsc70 includes three parts: a highly conservative amino-terminal adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain (residues 1-384), a peptide (substrate) binding domain (residues 385-543), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 544-646)
Our study find that Metformin treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of Hsc70 on Ser85 which located in ATPase domain of Hsc70.
Previously studies clarified that ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 induces a global conformational change and further causes substrate binding by Hsc70 and there are some co-factors like JDPs or Hsp150alpha that associate ATP consumption with conformational change of Hsc70, thus affecting its binding to the substrates
We speculate that the interaction of IKKα/β with Hsc70 can stimulate the ATPase activity, changes its conformation and enhances its affinity with substrates.
Ser85 plays an important role in this process, when Ser85 was mutated, ATPase activity is inhibited and the conformational change was blocked which weakens the binding with substrates.
This is in accordance with our results which S85A mutation blocked the interaction of Hsc70 and substrate proteins HK2 and PKM2.
Under physiological conditions, IKKα and IKKβ have been reported to exist as a heterodimer
Our results showed that CMA activation by Metformin triggers the activation of IKK activity and phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85, in an IKK-dependent manner.
We find that knockdown of either IKKα or IKKβ rescues the degradation of CMA substrates, suggesting that IKKα/β heterodimer is required for Metformin-induced activation of CMA.
This is in accordance with our in vitro kinase assays showing that the combination of IKKα and IKKβ further increases the phosphorylation of Hsc70 at Ser85 (Fig.
We found that Metformin-induced CMA activation is dependent on TAK1, expression of which has been shown to decline with age and linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and Parkinson's disease
Whether age-dependent loss of TAK1 and, based on the findings of our study, presumably, a decrease of the TAK1-IKKα/β-Hsc70 signaling that would result in a decrease of CMAmediated clearance of APP contributes to the pathogenesis of AD or other neurodegenerative diseases remains to be investigated.
The mean plasma concentrations of Metformin in humans are reported to be around 20 μmol/L (Graham 2011).
Metformin can rapidly cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) once in circulation and distributes well into several brain regions in Wistar rats and the drug concentration in brain tissue was almost equal to the plasma concentration
In this study, we discover that APP and its AD-associated mutant are novel CMA substrates.
We find that APP is degraded in an IKKα/β-dependent manner following Metformin treatment, both in SH-SY5Y cells and in APP/PS1 mice, and that phosphorylation of Hsc70 by IKKα/β promotes its interaction with APP and is critical for the alleviation of in vitro APP-induced cytotoxicity and in vivo rescue of both behavioral and molecular AD phenotypes.
These findings suggest that low IKKα/β activity may contribute to diminished clearance of APP and potentially link IKKα/β kinases to the (B) Mice were treated as in (A), and brain tissues were analyzed for soluble and insoluble Aβ 1-42 levels, using ELISA (mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, t-test).

Protein & Cell molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis.
Future studies will shed light on whether TAK1 or IKKα/β inhibitors can exacerbate AD phenotypes in APP/PS1 mice and whether pro-inflammatory pathways upstream of TAK1-IKKα/β signaling play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
Upregulation of APP and compromised CMA are common pathological features that contribute to the development of AD both in transgenic animal models and in human neurons affected in AD
Our study opens new avenues for concurrent CMA activation and degradation of APP via treatment with Metformin or overexpression of Hsc70.
We demonstrate that both Metformin-induced activation of CMA and activation of CMA by overexpression of Hsc70 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice can alleviate the cognitive deficits seen in this mouse model of AD, indicating that CMA activation can indeed be a viable therapeutic avenue for treatment of the AD.
Some clinical studies show that long-term Metformin treatment has been shown to decrease the risk of cognitive decline
Metformin has also been shown to reduce abnormal accumulation of Aβ and to improve memory
On the basis of reviewing scientific literature we can imply that there is a tendency towards the application of Metformin in the treatment of AD.
However, the exact mechanism of Metformin's advantageous activity in AD is not fully understood.
Metformin was suggested to be associated with the reduction of β-secretase, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of APP to Aβ
Our results delineate a molecular mechanism of Metformininduced CMA and degradation of APP and Aβ, thus, suggest an additional molecular pathway through which Metformin may alleviate the progression of AD.
More broadly, our study raises the possibility that activation of CMA by Metformin could also be beneficial to other CMA-related diseases, as well as other aging-associated and aggregation-associated pathologies, including various neurodegenerative diseases.
CMA activation selectively degrades the proteome (Kirchner 2019) and therefore is expected to differentially affect various signaling networks.
How Metformin-induced CMA activation affects various signaling networks in the context of, for example, pathways related to TNFα-induced inflammation, and whether this plays a role in the mechanism of action of Metformin in the context of type 2 diabetes, or the reported effects of Metformin on cancers

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture
HEK293T, SH-SY5Y, MEF AMPK WT, MEF AMPK DKO, HEK293 ATG5 WT, HEK293 ATG5 KO, Hela ATG8 WT, Hela ATG8 KO and PC12 cells were grown in DMEM medium (Hyclone, with L-glutamine, with 4.5 g/L glucose, without pyruvate); H4 cells were grown in DMEM medium (Hyclone, with L-glutamine, with 4.5 g/L glucose, with pyruvate).
These media were supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco TM ), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco TM ).
Doxycycline-inducible 293THK stable cell lines were generated by co-transfecting HP138-HK2 and HP216 plasmids (a gift from Dr. Hui Yang) into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine TM 2000 (Invitrogen TM ) and selected with 10 µg/mL puromycin (Sangon® Biotech), obtained monoclonal cell lines by flow cytometry.

High throughput screening
FDA-approved drugs or drug candidates library were purchased from Topscience, Inc. (Shanghai, China).
Drug concentration in the highthroughput screen was 10 μg/mL.
Spautin-1 (10 μmol/L) and AC220 (2 μmol/L) treatment was used as a positive control to induce Chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA), DMSO was used as a negative control since compounds from the screen library were dissolved in DMSO.
The inducers of CMA were screened using the 293THK stable cell line.
The high-throughput screening was done using flow cytometry.
Every plate has negative control (DMSO) and positive control (Spautin-1 + AC220), every plate has three replicates, and the screen Z-factor of every plate was > 0.5.

AAV-mCherry, AAV-Hsc70 WT-Flag-P2A-mCherry, or AAV-Hsc70 S85A-Flag-P2A-mCherry were injected into the hippocampus of 16-week-old APP/PS1 mice and behavioral tests and immunostaining were performed 12 weeks after the injections.
(F) Mice were treated as in (E) and subjected to MWM test.
Latency to escape to a hidden platform (time to find the platform shown in the right panel) during a 5-day training period is shown (n = 6 mice in mCherry injection APP/PS1 mice (Ctrl), n = 6 mice in Hsc70-WT injection APP/PS1 mice (Hsc70 WT) and n = 6 mice in Hsc70-S85A injection APP/PS1 mice (Hsc70 S85A); mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, t-test).
(G) Mice were treated as in (E) and brain tissues were analyzed for soluble and insoluble Aβ 1-42 levels, using ELISA (mean ± SD; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, t-test).
(H) Mice were treated as in (E) and immunohistochemistry of the hippocampus was performed to stain for amyloid plaques (6E10 antibody, green) and nuclei (DAPI, blue).
Scale bar, 1000 μm.
(I) Mice were treated as in (E) and mouse brain tissue lysates were immunoblotted with indicated antibodies (each band represents random independent mouse sample, n = 3 mice in WT, n = 3 mice in mCherry injection APP/PS1 mice (Ctrl), n = 3 mice in Hsc70-WT injection APP/PS1 mice (Hsc70 WT), n = 3 mice in Hsc70-S85A injection APP/PS1 mice (Hsc70 S85A)), the numbers under the blots represent the grayscale quantification normalized to tubulin..
