Liraglutide Has Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Amyloid Properties in Streptozotocin-Induced and 5xFAD Mouse Models of Alzheimer’s Disease
Recent clinical and epidemiological studies support the contention that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a strong risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The use of insulin cell toxin, streptozotocin (STZ), when injected into the lateral ventricles, develops an insulin resistant brain state (IRBS) and represents a non-transgenic, or sporadic AD model (SAD), with several AD-like neuropathological features.
The present study explored the effects of an anti-diabetic drug, liraglutide (LIR), in reversing major pathological hallmarks in the prodromal disease stage of both the 5xFAD transgenic and SAD mouse models of AD.
Three-month-old 5xFAD and age-matched wild type mice were given a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of STZ or vehicle (saline) and were subsequently treated with LIR, intraperitoneally (IP), once a day for 30 days.
The extent of neurodegeneration, Aβ plaque load, and key proteins associated with the insulin signaling pathways were measured using Western blot and neuroinflammation (via immunohistological assays) in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain were assessed following a series of behavioral tests used to measure cognitive function after LIR or vehicle treatments.
Our results indicated that STZ significantly increased neuroinflammation, Aβ plaque deposition and disrupted insulin signaling pathway, while 25 nmol/kg LIR, when injected IP, significantly decreased neuroinflammatory responses in both SAD and 5xFAD mice before significant cognitive changes were observed, suggesting LIR can reduce early neuropathology markers prior to the emergence of overt memory deficits.
Our results indicate that LIR has neuroprotective effects and has the potential to serve as an anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloid prophylactic therapy in the prodromal stages of AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common, progressive, age-related neurological disorder.
AD is characterized by impairment of memory and cognitive function, along with neurobehavioral abnormalities, and is the leading cause of death in the elderly population
The hallmark pathology of this disease is the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) proteins in the form of intraneuronal inclusions and extracellular neuritic plaques, intracellular

No Between-Group Differences Were Observed on Any Behavioral Measures
Analyses of passive avoidance (PA), open-field (OF), and object-recognition (NOR) tasks are represented in Figure
To test the differences in learning and memory on PA task, the ability of the mice to avoid an aversive stimulus, as measured in latency to enter the shock chamber, was analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA.
There were no significant between-group differences in the latency to avoid the shock in all trials [F (7,47) = 2.02, p = 0.07;Figure
There were also no significant between-group differences in the total time spent in the periphery (Figure

Results
Because no significant gender differences were observed on any of the measures in this study, the males and females were combined within each of the 8 sub-groups.
All mice survived all surgical and treatment interventions, so the analyses were performed on all the mice in the study.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to assess and compare whether LIR would have protective effects on prodromal neuropathology in sporadic and 5xFAD mouse models of AD.
In our study we injected STZ into 3-month-old WT mice to mimic sporadic AD
In addition, we further evaluated whether treatments of the GLP-1 analogue, LIR, could reduce those deficits.
We observed significant increased neuroinflammation in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain in both SAD and 5xFAD mice, along with Aβ pathology and STZ-induced disruption of the insulinsignaling pathway, and that treatment with LIR ameliorated these changes.
Previous studies demonstrated neuroprotective effects after LIR treatment in 7-9 month-and 14-16 monthold APP/PS1 mice
Although, studies have been done to check the prophylactic effects of long-term administration of LIR in two-month-old double transgenic mice
Accumulation of Aβ protein in the form of plaques is a major pathophysiological finding in AD.
The deposition of Aβ aggregates can trigger neurodegeneration, which can lead to cognitive disorders
Our study was designed to assess whether LIR treatments could alleviate Aβ pathology prior to the onset of cognitive decline.
We observed no significant differences between groups, on behavioral measures of open-field activity levels, recognition memory on novel-object recognition test and episodic memory as determined by increased latency to enter in the area where shocks were previously given during passive-avoidance tasks.
This outcome indicates that these mice accurately represented the prodromal stages of AD.
Previous studies have shown that cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice start to emerge at 4-5 months of age, therefore we didn't expect to see any cognitive deficits at 3 months of age in 5xFAD mice
We think different testing parameters between studies may be the reason for discrepant findings between studies.
The most salient difference may be that the repeated testing conducted in our study, especially with PA task, at this early age may have protected against deficits that would have otherwise emerged with time.
As such, our results are consistent with studies which reported that the inflammation and neuropathology, in the form of Aβ plaques and tau tangles, start to accumulate about a decade or more before the actual cognitive problems begin in AD patients
We found that following STZ injections, there was increased accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ inclusions along with a few extracellular Aβ plaque deposits in both SAD and 5xFAD mouse models.
Although we did not count the extra cellular plaques, we noticed very few extracellular plaques in few cortical sections of WT + STZ and 5xFAD + Vehicle mice.
An interesting finding, we noticed in our study was that STZ injections did not increase the Aβ levels in 5xFAD + STZ group and LIR seems to have no effect on the levels of Aβ in 5xFAD + STZ + LIR group, as evidenced by both immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses.
However, there was significant decrease in the levels of Aβ in the 5xFAD + LIR group when compared to 5xFAD + Vehicle, showing a treatment effect of LIR.
We think this is an important finding in this study, which eventually validated the use of LIR.
This observation warrants further detailed study in order to discern the role of STZ in transgenic mice.
We also observed no significant difference in the levels of Aβ in the WT + STZ + LIR group when compared to WT + STZ group.
This might be due to the relatively lower levels of Aβ and that LIR did not have enough of Aβ to show a significant effect.
However, we assume that as the animal ages and following long term administration of LIR, there might be a significant treatment effect.
In accordance to results from previous studies, which showed amelioration of Aβ pathology in transgenic mouse models
The accumulation of Aβ inclusions and few plaques in the present study may be due to STZ-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
In aging and neurodegeneration, there is a decline in the antioxidative mechanisms and previous studies have reported the ability of ROS to modify crucial molecules and proteins responsible for neurodegenerative diseases, like AD
LIR has the potential to serve as an antioxidant, as evidenced by in vitro studies done in SH-SY5Y cells
Although ROS levels were not directly assessed in our study, we hypothesize that LIR over time, can ameliorate the STZ-induced changes in Aβ of SAD and 5xFAD mice by an antioxidant effect, a goal for future study in this area.
An increase in neuroinflammation, along with activation of astrocytes and microglia, is one of the prominent pathologies observed in AD brain
A very early inflammatory response, through release of potent pro-inflammatory markers and activated microglia, happens before Aβ accumulation and this affects the clearance of Aβ plaques
In agreement with previous studies
Alleviation of these deficits with 30 days of LIR treatment in our study, correspond to findings by others who suggest that LIR was shown to have anti-inflammatory action in a double transgenic mouse model of AD
Our findings are consistent with previous studies which reported that the most obvious and important alteration in the brain that happens following administration of STZ is neuroinflammation and that it is more pronounced in SAD than transgenic AD model
It is evident from previous studies that DM is associated with inflammation, and a risk factor for the development of SAD.
Because LIR is used to treat DM, its use as an antiinflammatory agent for treating AD, especially SAD seems warranted.
Our results provide further evidence that LIR can be considered a promising anti-inflammatory agent in AD, even when used in the prodromal stages of the disease.
Recent studies have shown that incretin hormones, like LIR, are effective in restoring insulin sensitivity in AD mouse models
The neuroprotective and neurotropic roles of LIR in AD mouse models have been under consideration for treating neurodegenerative diseases, like AD
Insulin signaling in the brain occurs mainly via two phosphorylation pathways, PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
Our study focused on pathway where AKT and GSK3 activity regulates phosphorylation of tau and mediates Aβ neurotoxicity.
Although 5xFAD mice do not express neurofibrillary tangles, results from our study demonstrated that changes in the pIR, AKT and GSK3 expression correspond to disrupted insulin-signaling pathway in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain in both SAD and 5xFAD models.
Insulin-degrading enzyme, as the name suggests, degrades excess insulin in the body and plays a key role in degrading Aβ oligomers in vitro and in vivo under normal circumstances
STZ injections reduce the expression of IDE and contribute to accumulation of Aβ oligomers in the brain
Inability of the body to clear Aβ oligomers and increased microglial activity are thought to reduce the expression of IR and induce re-distribution and internalization of insulin receptors on the cell surface
This reaction downregulates the downstream signaling of AKT and other major proteins, finally, contributing to Aβ neurotoxicity
In agreement with results from the above-mentioned studies, our study demonstrated reduced expression of IDE and pIR in both mouse models of AD following STZ injections, but significantly more pronounced in SAD than in 5xFAD mice.
LIR restored the expression of IDE in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain.
These results are consistent with previous studies which showed that STZ injections reduced IDE expression to a larger extent in SAD than in transgenic mouse models
LIR also restored the levels of pIR in the cortical region of 5xFAD mice while it could just restore the levels of pIR in the hippocampal region of SAD mice but not in 5xFAD mice.
In fact, LIR further reduced the levels of pIR in the 5xFAD mice after STZ injection.
We noticed a significant increase in expression of cortical pIR in the 5xFAD + LIR group when compared to 5xFAD + Vehicle group.
However, the same pattern was not observed in the hippocampal region of 5xFAD mice.
We also observed a reduced expression of pAKT in both the cortical and hippocampal regions in both AD models following STZ injections, but treatments with LIR did not significantly elevate the pAKT levels in the SAD mice (except in the WT + LIR group) and in 5xFAD mice; in fact, LIR reduced the pAKT levels in 5xFAD + LIR group when compared to 5xFAD + Vehicle group in both cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain.
We noticed a trend towards LIR causing a further reduction of cortical pAKT levels in the WT + STZ + LIR mice when compared to WT + STZ group but the changes were not significant.
Overall, our results suggest that expressed levels of pAKT and pIR are difficult to predict in these relatively young mice.
Since the mice were only 4.7 months of age at the time of analyses, the disruption of PI3K/AKT pathway may not have yet reached its peak.
The changes of pIR and pAKT we observed, reflect the very early stages of disruption, although an initial surge in the expression of these proteins may have stabilized as the disease progressed.
With respect to the expression of pGSK3β, we noticed LIR treatment significantly restored the levels of pGSK3β in both cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain in both mouse models of AD, but to a greater extent in the SAD model.
Overall, our results provide in vivo evidence that the initial stages of impaired insulin signaling, especially in 5xFAD mice brain can cause increased Aβ protein levels through the activity of IDE, along with increased inflammatory response, to a greater extent in SAD mice, which is in keeping with evidence from previous studies
Our results also confirm that LIR has significant effects on the insulin signaling pathway, by the increasing the expression of IDE, pIR, and pGSK3β, which may be related to improvement of insulin signaling, the key downstream signaling proteins which are thought to be neuroprotective for the cell
Since we did not find any significant evidence for degenerating neurons, but found intraneuronal Aβ inclusions and prominent neuroinflammation, our results support the findings from previous studies which have shown that insulin-signaling dysfunction in the AD brain is correlated to neurodegeneration and Aβ pathology
When we compared the differences in the neuropathology induced by injections of STZ in both SAD and 5xFAD models, we noticed that neuroinflammation is an immediate and significant response to STZ in SAD mouse model than 5xFAD model, while Aβ pathology had a significant response to STZ in the 5xFAD mouse model than in the SAD model, along with disruption of insulin signaling markers like IDE, pIR, and pGSK3β, to a greater extent in SAD mice.
This pathology was significantly reversed by administration of LIR.
As such, our results strongly support the hypothesis that early intervention with anti-diabetic drugs might prove beneficial in reversing the neuroinflammatory pathology in SAD and amyloid pathology in 5xFAD mice in their prodromal stage of AD.
Further research is required to assess the long-term consequences of early LIR intervention and to compare its efficacy when treatments are delayed.

Animal Surgeries
Surgeries using a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) were performed in all the mice at 3 months of age as described previously
Mice were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane, combined with oxygen at 0.8 L/min throughout the procedure.
The mice were monitored continuously throughout surgery, and isoflurane and oxygen supply were adjusted as needed to maintain an appropriate level of anesthesia.
Prior to surgery the mice were cleaned with alcohol and the area of the incision was shaved.
The mice were stabilized with ear bars on the stereotaxic device, to keep lambda and bregma on the same plane.
The surgical site on the head was cleaned with chlorhexidine (Molnycke Healthcare, Norcross, GA, USA).
A midline incision was made on the scalp, fascia was retracted, and two burr holes were made through the skull directly above the lateral ventricles on both sides (coordinates relative to bregma: anterior + 0.5 mm; medial-lateral ± 1.1 mm; dorsal-ventral ± 2.0 mm).
The saline or STZ (3 mg/kg) solution was loaded into a 10-µL Hamilton micro-syringe and each mouse received bilateral injections of either STZ or vehicle at a constant rate of 0.3 µL/min.
After a 3-min diffusion period, the syringe was withdrawn and re-positioned into the contralateral hemisphere and the injection procedure was repeated.
The mice in the vehicle and LIR sub-groups were injected in the same manner with normal saline.
Surgical incisions were closed by using 7-mm sterile wound clips, and an analgesic ointment was applied to the incision site.
Following surgeries, mice were monitored in their recovery bins and transferred to their home bins when they were fully recovered.
Throughout the procedure, the body temperature of the mice was monitored via anal probe and adjusted using a warming pad.
Postoperative care was provided for 5 days to all the mice by monitoring vital signs, weight, activity, the amount of food and water ingested, as well as ensuring proper healing of the incision site.
If mice showed any signs of dehydration, IP injections of saline were given.
The wound clips were removed at 10 days following the surgery.

Animal Treatments
STZ was prepared fresh by dissolving 3 mg/kg of it into normal saline, which was injected via i.c.v.
route.
Sixteen days after STZ/saline injections, the mice in LIR sub-groups were injected once a day with LIR (25 nM/kg, dissolved in normal saline) intraperitoneally (IP)
At the same time, the mice in vehicle and STZ groups were injected with saline IP for 30 days.
The treatment protocol was adapted with slight modifications from previous studies
Examiners were blind to the identity of animals throughout the study.

Behavioral Testing
All animals were subjected to behavioral testing one week prior to euthanasia.
LIR injections were continued throughout the behavioral testing.
Researchers conducting the behavioral tests were blinded to the group identity of the animals.

Open Field Task
Spontaneous motor activity and exploratory behaviors of the mice were assessed in the open-field task following the protocols of Matchynski and colleagues (2013)
In the open-field task, mice were placed in a clear 26-× 46-× 30-cm polyethylene bins for 30 min during the dark cycle.
Using an automated, infrared array activity monitor (Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA, USA), spontaneous motor activity, along with time spent in the center and peripheral areas of the bin was assessed
These parameters were quantified by computerized software (Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA, USA), via breaks in the infrared light beams of the apparatus.
This task also served to habituate the mice for the novel-object-recognition tests, which were subsequently conducted in the same apparatus.

Novel Object Recognition
The object-recognition-task was conducted 24 h after open-field testing, following procedures as described previously
The animals were placed into 26-× 46-× 30-cm polyethylene bins for a 10-min acclimation trial.
Two small objects identical in shape and color, were placed about 3 cm from the wall in the opposite corners of the 26-cm side of the bin.
These acclimation sessions allowed the mice to explore the objects freely and were followed by a 5-min rest period in their home bins of the mice.
Following the 5-min rest period, the mouse was placed into the experimental bin, in which one of the previously explored objects was randomly replaced with a novel object, one of the same size but a different shape.
This final session lasted for 5 min, and the number of entries of the mouse into the familiar-and novel-object zones was measured.

Passive Avoidance (PA)
The PA task measures learning and memory of the mice.
The procedures used for this task were adapted from previous protocols
This task consisted of a step-through box (Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA, USA) with light and dark chambers, a sliding door separating the chambers, stainless-steel grids on to the floors of each chamber (with only the grid in the dark chamber being electrified).
Day 1 consisted of a 10-min acclimation period, in which animals were habituated to the testing apparatus by freely exploring the light and dark chambers of the apparatus.
Upon entrance into the dark chamber, the sliding door was closed, and exploratory behavior was recorded.
The animals remained in the chamber for the rest of the trial.
On day 2, the mice were placed in the light chamber and could freely explore the chambers for 10 min with the sliding door open.
Upon entrance into the dark chamber, the sliding door was closed, and following a 2-s delay, the mice were subjected to a 0.5 mA shock, lasting 2 s.
The mice were left in the cage for 10 s following the shock, at which time the trial was completed and the animals were placed back in their home cages.
This procedure was repeated on days 3, 4 and 5.
The latency to enter the dark chamber was the primary dependent variable.

Tissue Processing
For histological studies, mice were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (0.1 mL/kg, IP), and transcardially perfused with 0.1 M cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.4 to fix the brains.
The brains were then removed, stored in 4% PFA until further processing.
For fresh tissue samples, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.
The brains were then extracted, and cortical and hippocampal tissue was dissected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 • C, until further use.
For immunohistochemical analyses, glial fibrillary acidic protein-GFAP and ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) antibodies were used for labelling activated astrocytes, activated microglia respectively, whereas for labelling Aβ, 6E10 antibody was used.
For the GFAP immunofluorescence protocol
Sections were rinsed three times with 1 mM PBS for 10 min each.
The sections were then blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1 h at room temperature and were transferred to wells containing GFAP antibody (1:500) in NGS and PBS (1 mM, Ph 7.4) along with 10% NGS and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4 • C with continuous agitation.
The following day, the brain sections were rinsed three times with tris-buffer saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST).
After three washes, the sections were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000), conjugated with Alexa-fluor-594 (Molecular Probes, OR) for 60 min at room temperature in dark, with gentle agitation.
Sections were washed thoroughly with TBST and distilled water, mounted, air dried, and cover-slipped using anti-fading fluoromount aqueous mounting media, and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Leica; Wetzlar, Germany) with appropriate excitation and emission filters For FJB staining, 30-µm thick coronal sections were mounted on charged microscopic slides.
The sections were rehydrated with distilled water and then treated with 0.006% potassium permanganate for 45 min with gentle agitation.
The slides were then washed three times with distilled water, 5 min for each wash, and then treated with 0.001% FJB working solution in 0.1% acetic acid in deionized water for 30 min, with agitation.
Following this, the slides were washed, air dried and cover slipped with anti-fading fluoromount aqueous mounting medium and visualized using fluorescence microscope (Leica; Wetzlar, Germany) with appropriate excitation and emission filters.
For the immunoperoxidase protocol
The sections were then rinsed with PBS and blocked with 10% NGS mixed with PBS-triton for 1 h at room temperature on a bench-top shaker to provide gentle agitation.
The tissue was then incubated with Iba-1 (1:3500) at room temperature for 4 h and then kept overnight at 4 • C in the 6E10 antibodies (1:500).
The following day, sections were washed three times with TBST and incubated with anti-rabbit (for Iba-1) and anti-mouse (for 6E10) biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
After three washes with TBST, the sections were incubated with peroxidase substrate solution supplied with ABC kit, and the signal was developed using diaminobenzidine (DAB), until the desired staining intensity was noted.
The tissue was then washed with distilled water, cleared, mounted on to positive-charged slides, air dried and cover slipped using DePex mounting media.
The sections were visualized using a compound light microscope (Olympus; Tokyo, Japan).

Quantification of IHC Images
Quantification of GFAP-, Iba-1-, and FJB-IR cells, along with markers for Aβ were taken from four randomly selected areas of 6-9 tissue sections from the cortex and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus.
Images were captured using 20× objective (total magnification 200 times) on the Leica (for GFAP and FJB) and Olympus (for Iba-1 and Aβ.
These images were analyzed using Image-J software (
The total area of each image was measured, and the number of GFAP-, Iba-1-, and FJB-IR cells, and the number of Aβ plaques were counted by three researchers who were blinded to the group identity of the samples.
Only clearly visible large red fluorescent signals for GFAP and green fluorescent signals for FJB or DAB-labelled, brown-colored cells were counted as GFAP-IR, FJB-positive, Iba-1-IR cells respectively.
The number of IR cells were expressed per 100 µm 2 area.
Samples from 3 different mice in each group were used for each parameter that was tested.

Western Blot
The tissue collected for Western blot analyses was processed, as described previously
Tissue was homogenized, using homogenizer and pre-chilled radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (RIPA, containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mM of Nacl, 30 mM of NaF, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM of protease cocktail inhibitors).
The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000× g at 4 • C for 20 min.
Then, 20 µL of the supernatant was aliquoted into PCR tubes and stored at -80 • C until further use.
Protein concentrations for each sample were measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay (Table
Samples were mixed with equal amounts of 2× SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 3 min at 100 • C.
Then, 150 µg of protein from each sample was loaded on a 4-20% gradient (for Aβ protein, IDE, pIR) and by 10% (for pAKT, and pGSK3β) tris-glycine gel and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred on to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
The membrane was blocked by 5% skim milk powder dissolved in TBST and gently agitated using a shaker at room temperature for 1 h.
The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 o C using the following primary antibodies (1:1000): Mouse anti-Aβ (6E10); mouse anti-IDE; rabbit anti-phospho-AKT; mouse anti-AKT; rabbit anti-GSK3β; rabbit anti-phospho-GSK3β; and rabbit anti-phospho-IR (Table
The next day, blots were washed with TBST for 3 times.
Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:20,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) mixed in 1.5% skim milk powder dissolved in TBST for 1 h at room temperature.
GAPDH was used as a loading control for all the Western blot studies.
Following this, the membranes were washed thoroughly three times with TBST.
The blots were then developed with Western Chemiluminescent HRP-substrate by Pierce ECL Plus (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The optical densities of the bands were measured using Image-J analysis software (

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v24.
All the data were expressed as mean ± SEM.
The latency to escape in passive avoidance task was analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), while one-way ANOVA was used to analyze open-field and NO-recognition data.
IHC and Western-blot data were analyzed using oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) post hoc tests conducted, when appropriate.
The alpha value is set at p < 0.05 for all analyses.

Conclusions
Although our understanding of the link between AD and T2DM has increased considerably in recent years, there is still an unmet requirement for an effective therapeutic approach.
Our study provides the first comparison of the prodromal pathological abnormalities between SAD and the 5xFAD mice.
Our results indicate that neuroinflammation, and the disrupted insulin-signaling pathway was alleviated by treatment with LIR to a greater extent in prodromal STZ/sporadic AD mice than in prodromal 5xFAD mice, while Aβ pathology was alleviated by treatment with LIR to a greater extent in 5xFAD mice than in prodromal SAD.
Our results support the hypothesis that LIR is a promising therapeutic agent, with significant anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloid properties, which could reduce and/or delay the onset of symptoms in prodromal stages of AD, especially in the sporadic form of the disease.

Open-field (OF) task was used to assess spontaneous motor activities, exploratory behaviors were assessed through novel object recognition (NOR) task, and the differences in learning and memory were assessed through passive avoidance (PA) task.
There were no significant between-group differences in the total time spent in the periphery (A) and in the center (B) of the open-field task over 60 min and in the number of entries into the familiarobject (FO; (C)) and novel-object (NO; (D)) zone in the NOR task.
To test the differences in learning and memory on PA task, the ability of the mice to avoid an aversive stimulus, as measured in latency to enter the shock chamber, was analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA.
There were no significant between-group differences in the latency to avoid the shock in all trials between SAD and 5xFAD mouse models ((E,F), respectively).
Data from n = 6 animals from each group were expressed as mean ± SEM.

Liraglutide Increased the Levels of Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE) in the Cortical and Hippocampal Regions of WT and 5xFAD Mice, While LLiraglutide Increased Phosphorylated Insulin Receptor (pIR) in the Cortical but Not the Hippocampal Regions of the WT and 5xFAD Mice Overall significant differences were observed in IDE levels in both cortical [F (7,24) = 82.55,
p < 0.05] and hippocampal [F (7,24) = 15.079,
p < 0.05] regions of the brain (Figure 5A-D).
Tukey's post hoc tests revealed a significant decrease in IDE levels in the cortical regions of the brain in the WT + STZ group when compared to WT + Vehicle group (p < 0.001).LIR treatments prevented the decrease of IDE in the WT + STZ + LIR and WT + LIR groups, when compared to WT + Vehicle and WT + STZ mice (Figure5A,C).
No significant differences were observed in IDE levels for the 5xFAD + Vehicle when compared to 5xFAD + STZ and 5xFAD + STZ + LIR mice (p = 0.23 and p = 0.89, respectively).
LIR treatments prevented the decrease in IDE levels in the 5xFAD + LIR group when compared to 5xFAD + Vehicle and 5xFAD + STZ + LIR groups (p < 0.01).
