Glucosylpolyphenols as Inhibitors of Aβ-Induced Fyn Kinase Activation and Tau Phosphorylation: Synthesis, Membrane Permeability, and Exploratory Target Assessment within the Scope of Type 2 Diabetes and Alzheimer’s Disease
Despite the rapidly increasing number of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetesinduced dementia, there are no disease-modifying therapies able to prevent or block disease progress.
In this work, we investigate the potential of nature-inspired glucosylpolyphenols against relevant targets, including islet amyloid polypeptide, glucosidases and cholinesterases.
Moreover, with the premise of Fyn kinase as a paradigm-shifting target in Alzheimer's drug discovery, we explore glucosylpolyphenols as blockers of Aβ-induced Fyn kinase activation, while looking into downstream effects leading to Tau hyperphosphorylation. Several compounds inhibit Aβ-induced Fyn kinase activation and decrease pTau levels at 10 μM concentration, particularly the per-O-methylated glucosylacetophloroglucinol and the 4-glucosylcatechol dibenzoate, the latter inhibiting also butyrylcholinesterase and -glucosidase.
Both compounds are non-toxic with ideal pharmacokinetic properties for further development.
This work ultimately highlights the multitarget nature, fine structural tuning capacity and valuable therapeutic significance of glucosylpolyphenols in the context of these metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders.

Introduction
More than 463 million adults are currently suffering from type 2 diabetes (T2D) worldwide,
T2D -the non-insulin dependent type of diabetes -primarily arises from the ingestion of high-fat diets and lack of physical exercise, which leads to hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and, ultimately, hyperglycemia.
In turn, AD is characterized for the presence of extracellular deposits of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the senile plaques and for intracellular neurofibrillary tangles induced by deposits of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, accompanied by synaptic dysfunction resulting in neuronal death.
Moreover, genetic deletion of Fyn prevents Aβos-induced cell death in hippocampus and Fyn inhibition restores synapse density and memory function in transgenic mice.
Interestingly, Fyn inhibition, deficiency, or genetic knockout were found to have increased glucose disposal due to increased insulin sensitivity, improved fatty acid oxidation, with decreased visceral adipose tissue inflammation.
]
Other pathophysiological mechanisms are known to be present in both T2D and AD, namely peripheral and brain insulin resistance and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) downregulation leading to increased brain Aβ levels.
With the lack of therapeutic alternatives able to block disease progression in both cases, we were interested in finding new molecular entities able to tackle several molecular targets common to AD and DID with disease-modifying effects.
For this purpose, we turned to nature for inspiration.
Polyphenols have been widely reported in the literature for their vast therapeutic potential, with described antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.

Chemistry

A. C-Glucosylation
For the generation of glucosylpolyphenols, we employed either a permethylated glucopyranoside
Polyphenols containing their hydroxy groups in meta, para and ortho orientation were used as acceptors in a series of C-glycosylation reactions, and the differences in their reactivity were attentively explored.
2-Naphthol was also used to generate a C-glucosyl analogue with two fused planar rings, in order to mimic rings A and C in the original structure.
Precursors and conditions leading to the higher yields are presented in Tables
In the case of catechol and hydroquinone, when using benzyl protected sugar donors, glycosylation yields were drastically lower when compared to reactions either with phloroglucinol or trihydroxyacetophenone as sugar acceptors.
In the first two cases, different solvent proportions, anomeric protecting group and promoter equivalents were tried attempting to optimize the reaction efficacy; yet, after much experimentation no significant improvements could be observed.
Moreover, no significant differences were found when trying to improve the efficacy of hydroquinone and catechol C-glycosylation using either TMSOTf or BF 3 .
Et 2 O. Notwithstanding, for the first time, per-O-methyl-β-glucosylated polyphenols have been accessed in good yields by using TMSOTf as promoter and fully O-methylated methyl glucoside as the glycosyl donor.
This methodology constitutes an advantage when compared to other approaches by saving reaction steps in the generation of donors with good leaving groups.
Methyl protected glucosyl donor gave, by reaction with all the acceptors tested, C-glucosyl polyphenols as the major products (7-11, Table
Interestingly, with benzyl protected glucosyl donors only glucosylphloroglucinol 13, 3glucosyl-2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone 14 and 1-glucosylnaphthalen-2-ol 16 were formed in moderate yields as the electron-donating effects of their aglycones was strong enough to promote C-glucosylation.
On the other hand, catechol and hydroquinone gave C-glucosyl derivatives in very low yield (Table

DCM -dichloromethane
Notably, after careful analysis of the NMR spectra we observed that the para-isomers are formed in the synthesis of catechol C-glucosides 7 and 12, thus indicating that the Lewis acid-promoted Friedel-Crafts-type C-glycosylation is the favored reaction mechanism, prevalent over the Fries-type rearrangement described for unprotected phenols.
While the synthesis of D-rhamnosyl

B. O-Acylation
A benzoyl group was regioselectively introduced in glucosylhydroquinone derivatives 10 and 15 to afford analogues of 1 on the basis of a para hydroxylation pattern (a, Figure
Using imidazole, DMAP and benzoyl chloride, the desired ester derivatives 17 and 19 were obtained as the major products in good yield, together with their dibenzoate analogues 18 and 20 (Scheme 2).
Further deprotection of benzyl protected derivatives through catalytic hydrogenation gave the corresponding deprotected compounds 21 and 22.
For comparison purposes, compounds 14 and 16 were also debenzylated to afford compounds 23 and 24, respectively (vd.
experimental section).
The observed regioselectivity of these O-acylation reactions may be related with stereochemical hindrance and eventual hydrogen bonding between the free hydroxy group and the sugar, thus enhancing the relative reactivity of the remaining phenol hydroxy group towards esterification.
Accordingly, regioselective esterification was not observed with glucosylcatechol derivatives 7 and 12 (structure type b, Figure
Instead, by applying the same experimental procedure, an inseparable mixture of mono-benzoylated compounds was obtained, which supports this hypothesis.
For Moreover, the hydroquinone and catechol per-O-benzyl glycosides 27α,β and 31 (Scheme 3), obtained as major products under the C-glucosylation reaction conditions (Table

C. C-Acylation
The glucosylphloroglucinol 13 was originally chosen as the precursor of the planned analogue of compound 1 with the meta hydroxylation pattern (c, Figure
Provided that this trihydroxybenzene is an extremely electron-rich aromatic system, we were expecting a very straightforward Friedel-Crafts-type acylation to occur with phenylacetyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid.
After much experimentation employing a number of Lewis acids (e.g.
BF 3 •Et 2 O, TMSOTf FeCl 3 , TfOH) and several different conditions without any success, we hypothesized that the sugar moiety could be reducing the reactivity of the aromatic ring or even being degraded in the course of these reactions.
The initial Cacylation of the phenol residue followed by C-glycosylation turned out to be the best option to address this issue.
Due to the dual reactivity of unprotected polyphenols towards electrophiles, hydroxy groups and, as in this case, highly activated nucleophilic carbons, the control of O-/C-acylation was not an easy task.
While an equimolecular amount or an excess of TfOH in absence of solvent generated the di-C-acylated product, the use of TfOH 2% in MeCN rendered a mixture of the O-/C-acylated products in a ratio of ca.
1/0.3 (Scheme 4).
Then, using an excess of TfOH, which acted both as the solvent and catalyst, compound 35, obtained in 25% yield from trihydroxybenzene, was rearranged into the C-acylated analogue 34 in 39% yield, which was subsequently C-glycosylated to afford compound 36 in 33% yield.
After catalytic hydrogenation the final analogue 37 was isolated in 68% isolated yield.

A. DFT calculations and molecular interactions of rationally designed analogues with hIAPP by STD-NMR
IAPP is co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic -cells.
In prediabetes, insulin resistance leads to a compensatory hypersecretion of insulin and IAPP, leading to its aggregation and deposition in the pancreas in the form of cytotoxic amyloid oligomers and fibrils.
Along with disease progression, this accumulation will lead to the loss and dysfunction of -cells, which justifies why patients with advanced T2D are no longer able to produce insulin, despite being insulin resistant.
Hence, IAPP is an important therapeutic target in T2D, particularly in the prevention of pancreatic dysfunction arising from aberrant insulin secretion.
In this context the interaction of 1 against hIAPP was previously unveiled by saturation-transfer difference (STD) NMR techniques, being also shown, by Atomic Force Microscopy, the ability of this compound to inhibit hIAPP aggregation into amyloid oligomers and fibrils.
Based on these findings, we were interested in assessing if the rationally designed analogues 21 and 37 (aimed at mimicking the original scaffold) would exhibit the same level of interaction with hIAPP and if the binding epitope would be maintained in the absence of the central fused ring system.
Being more easily accessed in fewer synthetic steps, both 21 and 37 have increased molecular flexibility when compared to the lead compound 1.
DFT calculations [PBE0/6-311G** (H 2 O)] show that low-energy conformations of compounds 21 and 37 are superimposable with compound 1 (Figure
The STD-derived binding epitope obtained for compounds 1, 21 and 37 against hIAPP by STD-NMR (Figure
As in the case of compound 1, the highest STD intensities correspond to the protons of the aromatic core of compounds 21 and 37 (% STD > 80%), when compared to those detected for the glucosyl group (% STD < 40%).
These experiments show that the binding affinity of the antidiabetic lead 1 is not related to the molecular planarity of the isoflavone core.
Being accessed in only 5 synthetic steps (instead of the 9 needed for the synthesis of the lead molecule 1), compounds 21 and 37 exhibit a clear binding against hIAPP.
Given the reported anti-amyloidogenic properties of 1 against hIAPP,

B. Inhibition of PrP C -A oligomers interaction
In the last few years, the failure of several clinical trials targeting soluble and fibrillar A by monoclonal antibodies have motivated the scientific community to work in the diversification of therapeutic targets for AD.
One possible strategy is to focus on the downstream effects of A rather than on its accumulation and aggregation.
Soluble Aos were shown to bind to PrP C on the neuronal cell surface initiating a cascade through activation of Fyn kinase.
Indeed, it is possible to monitor the activation of Src family kinases (SFKs) such as Fyn kinase by measuring the expression of phosphospecific epitopes, as previously reported.
rthermore, it is commonly assumed that formation of Aβ fibrils and plaque deposits is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of AD.
As with most of the identified Aβ receptors, PrP C was found to bind Aβos with much higher affinity than monomeric Aβ (mAβ).
In this work, Natural Aβos, a kind gift from Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience -SITraN (UK), were used.
These were derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (7PA2 cells) stably transfected with cDNA encoding APP751, an amyloid precursor protein that contains the Val717Phe familial Alzheimer's disease mutation, as previously described.
The Aβos solution contains between 12,000-14,000 pg/mL of total Aβos as measured by ELISA.
This concentration is comparable to that of Aβ peptides detected in human cerebrospinal fluid.
The Aβos prepared represent a heterogeneous population of monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers, higher state soluble oligomers and other cellular proteins as previously reported by Western blotting
The Aβos preparation using the same protocol has been applied in the same way by other groups.
The same batch of the recombinant soluble Aβos was used for all experiments described in the manuscript to minimize impact of experimental variations caused by the heterogeneous preparation of the Aβos.
1,000 pg/mL of natural Aβos were used to treat HEK 293 cells, immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed to detect cellular prion protein, then the slides where imaged with Confocal Microscope Leica TCS SP5 II objective 63X oil form Leica Microsystems (Figure
In order to validate the observed binding between PrP C and Aβos we performed a PRNP knockdown by using the commercially available kit ON-TARGETplus Human PRNP (5621) siRNA -SMARTpool.
Because only the PrP C on the cell surface fraction is involved in the interaction with Aβos, the knockdown was combined with acute cleavage promoted by phospholipase C (PLC).
A live cell staining and imaging was performed, and cells were analyzed by Flow Cytometry: Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).
As controls were used untreated cells and cells treated with ON-TARGETplus Nontargeting siRNA Pool (scrambled siRNA).
The result was a protein expression reduction by more than 80% (Figure
It is also interesting to note that phospholipase C (PLC) can cleave PrP C on the surface and improve the effects of knockdown further, i.e. further reduces the PrP C on the cell surface.
Compound screening in HEK 293 cell lines, previously treated with fresh natural Aos, showed compounds interfering with the PrP C -Aos binding (Figure

C. Inhibition of A-induced Fyn activation
The Opera ® High Content Screening System was used in this section, as it is applied to test drugs capable of reversing the altered phenotype observed in AD such as Fyn activation.
Figure
However, we observed that the level of A-induced Fyn Fyn kinase plays an important role in the physiology of neuronal cells by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation during the development of the CNS.
This enzyme is also involved in signalling transduction pathways that regulate survival, metabolism and neuronal migration.
Considering that Fyn inhibition below the physiological levels (basal levels) could be deleterious for the homeostasis of the cells, we decided to investigate the effects of the compounds on the basal levels of pFyn.
Thus, neuronal progenitor cells were treated with the compounds without addition of A to determine whether the effects observed are independent of A treatment, and it was confirmed that tested compounds and PP1 alone do not reduce the basal levels of pFyn (Figure
A rather diverse selection of compounds was able to produce the desired effects, ranging from per-O-methyl and polyhydroxy forms.
Curiously, the natural compound that served as the inspiration for this study (1) was only able to cause a non-significant reduction in A-induced Fyn activation.
Yet, the rationally designed and more flexible hydroquinone monobenzoate (21) exhibited significant differences when compared to A alone.
In fact, chemical modifications made in the original scaffold towards simpler versions of compound 1 without ring B (e.g. in compounds 8, 9, and 23) were generally more beneficial for the desired activity.
On the other hand, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the advantages or disadvantages of sugars decorated with per-O-methyl groups, as no correlation between structure and activity could be found regarding this matter.
A good example is the presence and absence of these groups in the two most complex hits found in this assay, compounds 25 and 26, respectively.
We also evaluated the activity of Fyn kinase in the presence of some compounds by ADP-Glo™ kinase assay, a luminescent ADP detection assay (Figure
This assay provides a homogeneous and high-throughput screening method to measure kinase activity by quantifying the amount of ADP produced during a kinase reaction.
As presented in Figure
Furthermore, from the evaluated compounds, only 8 and 10 were able to act as Fyn kinase inhibitors, denoting that they may have an added therapeutic value against DID given the recognized role of Fyn kinase activity in insulin sensitivity and lipid utilization.
]
It is also important to note that, as tested by a thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay with A(1-42) (see Figure
Most importantly, these results indicate that these compounds are not PAINS acting via autoxidation of catechol/hydroquinone and subsequent covalent binding to proteins, contrarily to quercetin, a well-known PAIN compound
To estimate eventual behavior of compounds 9, 23, and 26 as pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), in particular as membrane PAINS, we have evaluated their potential using a computational protocol.
The potential of mean force high concentrations the absorption spectra of the positive control, quercetin, suffers drastic changes (Figure
First, the typical band of the monomeric species, with maximum at ca. 385 nm,
This is caused by the loss of the double bond character due to rotation of the 2-1' bond out of plane, and consequently the loss of the planar conformation.
Also, new bands are visible at ca. 375 nm that indicate the presence of extended conjugation, through catechol-catechol bonds.
A new band is also visible for the highest concentration of 100 µM between 245 and 270 nm, which, when compared with the absorption spectra of the different ionization states of the molecule
All these changes are related to the aggregation of the compound.
In fact, the pKa of a compound in an aggregate (e.g., micellar) environment is different from the one of the monomeric species in solution, shifting the ionization equilibrium.
If any of the compounds tested were aggregating, changes in the absorption spectra would be readily detected, which was not the case.
For compounds 18 and 25, solutions with only 1.25% and 2.5% DMSO were visibly turbid, especially for 100 µM, which is an indication of the low aqueous solubility of these compounds that might be due to their high lipophilicity.
With a value as high as 5% of DMSO, the solutions with higher compound concentrations (50 µM and 100 µM) were still turbid.
However, this was not the case at 10 µM and, as can be observed in Figure
This indicates that at this concentration these two compounds are not aggregating.
Finally, a linear relationship was confirmed between the concentration and the peak absorbance for the lower energy band of each compound and for the non-aggregating ketoconazole (Figures
In summary, compounds 8, 9, 10, 21, 23, 24, 26 and 33 are not promiscuous aggregators in the concentration range tested, which encompasses all the concentrations used for the other assays.
Our results for compounds 18 and 25 show that at the concentration of 10 μM no aggregation was detected but at high concentrations, the herein presented inhibition constants should be considered only as estimates and interpreted with caution.
The aggregation studies confirm that bioactivities herein reported are not due to non-specific effects resulting from the formation of compound aggregates and are thus the result of bona fide specific compound activity.

E. Inhibition of A-induced Tau phosphorylation
Intraneuronal Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of paired helical filaments (PHF)s are a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
This NFTs are formed of hyperphosphorylated Tau.
Tau is hyperphosphorylated in AD brain at multiple sites including at residues Thr181.

F. Cytotoxicity in neuronal cells derived from hiPSCs
In order to confirm that the synthesized compounds are not cytotoxic at relevant concentrations, we have differentiated hiPSC cells derived from health control MIFF1 63 into neural cells.
We observed that, after 20 days of differentiation, these cells express specific neural progenitor markers such as Nestin.
NPC cells were treated with each compound for 24 hours, and none presented any signs of cytotoxicity at 10 µM (Figure
Furthermore, compounds 23, 26, and 29
were not cytotoxic in concentrations up to 100 µM, while 9 is safe to administer up to a 50 µM concentration (data not shown).
The values are expressed as the mean ± SEM; n = 3. Significant differences between control are indicated with * (p <0.05).

G. Glycosidase and cholinesterase inhibitory activity screening
Postprandial glycemia control is key in managing T2D clinical manifestations.
This control can be achieved through the inhibition of intestinal glucosidases, in particular α-glucosidase.
These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates present in the gut into simple sugars able to be absorbed into the blood stream and thus contribute to the increase of glycemia levels.
Since we had previously elucidated the powerful α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the ethyl acetate extract of Genista tenera where compound 1 is the major component (97.6% for the extract vs. 82.2%
for the commercial drug acarbose), we were interested in finding out if it was due to the presence of the lead C-glucosyl isoflavone.
However, 1 was found to have only modest activity, with 14% inhibition at 100 μM (Table
This compound was a slightly better β-glucosidase inhibitor, being able to decrease its activity in 23% at the same concentration.
Notably, these activities are cumulative with the antihyperglycemic effects of 1 observed in Wistar rats, since treatment was administered i.p.
Genistein, on the other hand, is a powerful α-glucosidase uncompetitive inhibitor (84% inhibition at 100 μM; K ib = 12 ± 2 µM) and a moderate β-glucosidase competitive inhibitor (44% inhibition at 100 μM; K ia = 66 ± 13 µM), indicating that the presence of the C-C linked sugar moiety at C-8 is, in this case, detrimental to activity.
Remarkably, the catechol glucoside 33 was found to be the best glucosidase inhibitor amongst the synthesized analogues, with an excellent αglucosidase competitive inhibitor activity (74% inhibition at 100 µM; K ia = 39 ± 4 µM), and a modest β-glucosidase inhibitor activity (13% inhibition at 100 µM).
Apart from this compound, only three others were able to concomitantly inhibit both glucosidases: the hydroquinone derivatives 17 and 29, and the naphthalen-2-ol derivative 24.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) are two well-characterized therapeutic targets in AD owing to their ability to catalyse the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is responsible for the cognitive functionality, and whose level is particularly low in AD patients.
Three of the so far four FDA-approved drugs for AD consist of selective or dual cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine.
The inhibition of AChE and BuChE correlate with lower Aβ levels, decreased Aβ aggregation, improved learning and memory.
8]
however, the levels of this enzyme progressively increase in AD, whereas those of AChE decline or remain unchanged.
t so well studied and divulged is the role of butyrylcholinesterase in the etiology of T2D.
However, elevated AChE, but especially serum BuChE activity have been correlated with insulin resistance, increased adiposity and abnormal serum lipid profile, being regarded as a risk factor for T2D.
3]
Similar to what was described for α-glucosidase, the ethyl acetate extract of Genista tenera was capable of inhibiting this enzyme (77.0%
at 130 μg/mL).
Hence, we were interested in assessing whether the anticholinergic activity of the extract was due to the presence of 1 as a major component.
This compound was however able to inhibit AChE only by 26% at 100 μM (43 μg/mL) and, in this assay, genistein presented merely half of the inhibitory capacity of 1 (Table
On the contrary, genistein was a much stronger BuChE inhibitor than 1, displaying 41% inhibition at 100 μM.
From the synthesized analogues of

H. Membrane permeability assays
Compounds were tested in a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) in order to measure and rationalize their potential to cross membrane barriers.
Testosterone was used as the positive control in this assay.
It is important to note that this assay merely looks into the ability of compounds to passively diffuse through cell membranes.
Being glycosides, it is possible that the sugar moiety acts as a shuttle for their passage into the brain through GLUT-1 transporters highly expressed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as previously reported for similar molecules.
complete our analysis, the partition coefficient at physiological pH (log D 7.4 ) was also determined for most compounds.
Ideally, log D values should be located between 1 and 4 for a good compromise between solubility and membrane permeability allowing oral availability, good cell permeation and low metabolic susceptibility.
Results are presented in Table
The optimal effective permeability of compound 1 (log P e > -5.7) indicates that it can cross membrane barriers, which is consistent with the therapeutic use of the plant Genista tenera in traditional medicine in the form of an antidiabetic tea infusion.
Moreover, our results for compounds 7-11 suggest that the transformation of the sugar hydroxy groups into methyl ether moieties succeeded at enhancing membrane permeability (see fully unprotected compounds 23 and 24).
Among these compounds is 9, the per-methylglucosyl derivative of acetophloroglucinol, which was found to decrease A-induced Fyn activation with consequent downstream effects in the reduction of Tau hyperphosphorylation.
This compound presented an effective permeability (log P e = -4.74
± 0.02) and determined log D values (2.3 ± 0.3) that are compatible with the desired pharmacokinetic profile and thus contrasting with its bioactive polyhydroxy analogue 23.
When applied to compounds with more than one aromatic ring, this sugar per-methylation approach resulted in extremely lipophilic compounds with a tendency to equilibrate or to get retained in biological membranes (compounds 17, 18 and 25).
In contrast, with three aromatic rings but without the sugar O-methyl groups, compound 26, another promising hit in our bioactivity experiments, presents an acceptable effective permeability (log P e = -5.06
± 0.08).

Discussion and Conclusions
In the present work we have developed a library of glucosylpolyphenols inspired in the natural product with therapeutic potential 1 and explored their activity against multiple AD and T2D targets, namely Fyn kinase, Tau hyperphosphorylation, hIAPP, glucosidase and cholinesterase enzymes.
On the path towards their synthesis, we disclosed the feasibility and effectiveness of C-glucosylation of polyphenols with different hydroxylation pattern and rationalized the importance of sugar protecting groups in these reactions.
Moreover, we present an exception to the Fries-type rearrangement leading to the C-glycosylation of unprotected polyphenols, which afforded compounds 7 and 12 -two important precursors in the synthesis of novel bioactive molecular entities against our targets of interest.
Being structurally less complex and synthesized in only 5 steps (vs. 9 steps required for the generation of the natural isoflavone 1), the rationally designed analogue 21 is here presented as a new alterative for tackling hIAPP detrimental effects in T2D and DID.
STD-NMR experiments show that compound 21 clearly binds to hIAPP and in general with a similar binding epitope to that of compound 1, which highlights that the absence of the central fused ring system of HPLC grade solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification.

Glucosidase and Cholinesterase inhibition assays.
Measurement of the glycosidase inhibition was carried out using the methodology previously reported by Bols and coworkers.
Inhibition assays were conducted in a double-beam Hitachi U-2900 spectrophotometer, with PS cuvettes at the wavelength indicated in each case.
α-Glucosidase Page 46 of 66 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of Medicinal Chemistry ✭Saccharomyces cerevisiae✮ and β-glucosidase (almonds) were used as model enzymes, and the corresponding pnitrophenyl glycosides as substrates.
Initial screening for determining the percentage of inhibition was conducted at a 100 µM inhibitor concentration.
Inhibitor mother solutions were prepared in DMSO and the ratio of DMSO in the cuvette was maintained at 5%.
Two 1.2-mL samples in PS cuvettes containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) were prepared using the corresponding nitrophenyl glucopyranoside as substrate at a concentration equal to the expected value of K M .
Water (control) or inhibitor solution plus water (100 µM final concentration) were added to a constant value of 1.14 mL.
Finally, reaction was initiated by the addition of a solution of properly diluted enzyme (60 µL) at 25 ºC, and was monitored by registering the increase in absorbance at 400 nm for 125 s.
Initial rates were obtained from the slopes of the plots (Abs.
vs. t) and used for calculating the percentage of inhibition, using the following equation: [I]) plots.
The procedure followed was the same as above, but using 5 different substrate concentrations, ranging from 0.25 to 4.0 of the expected K M , while keeping constant the inhibitor concentration (3 different inhibitor concentrations).
The reaction rate for the cuvette containing the highest substrate concentration was allowed to be within 0.12-0.15
Abs/min.
Kinetic parameters (K M , V max ) were obtained using nonlinear regression analysis (least squares fit) using the Michaelis-Menten equation tool implemented in GraphPad Prism 8.01 software, which in turn were used to calculate the inhibition constants, according to the equations indicated below.
For cholinesterase inhibition tests (acetylcholinesterase (AChE, electrophorus electricus) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE, equine serum), the Ellman's cholorimetric assay
Competitive inhibition (inhibitor only binds the free enzyme):
Mixed inhibition (inhibitor binds both, the free and the complexed enzyme):
Uncompetitive (the inhibitors only bind the complexed enzyme):
Non-competitive (inhibitor binds both the free enzyme and the complexed enzyme with equal affinity):
The following inhibitor concentrations were used for the calculation of the inhibition constants: Experiments were carried out in duplicate, and the data are expressed as the mean ± SD.
Cell culture.
The human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) line derived from a health control individual used in this study.
The hiPS (control MIFF1)
hiPSCs were maintained in Vitronectin-coated plates (0.5μg/cm 2 ;
ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendations in complete TeSR™-E8™ Medium (StemCell Technologies).
Culture medium was changed every day.
Cells were passaged every 5-7 days as clumps using
ReLeSR™ an enzyme-free reagent for cell dissociation (StemCell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
For all the experiments in this study, hiPSCs were used between passage 18 and 26, all hiPSCs were cultured in 5% O 2 , 5% CO 2 at 37°C.

Natural A oligomer and control solutions.
A solution containing natural amyloid-beta (A) oligomers (a kind gift of Dr. Claire Garwood) was derived from the conditioned medium of 7PA2 cells,
In order to obtain natural A oligomers 5x10 6 cells were seeded in a T175 flask and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) 50 mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin.
Cells were incubated for 24 hours in 5% CO 2 at 37°C.
After 24 h of incubation the cells were washed with serum-free medium and conditioned in 5 mL of plain DMEM without phenol red (ThermoFisher) and lacking any additives, overnight.
The oligomer-containing conditioned medium (CM) was collected and cleared of cells and debris by centrifugation at 200 g for 10 min at 4°C.
The CM was used as the natural A oligomer solution in the fear conditioning experiments for HCS.
The concentrated CM contained between 1000-2000 pg/mL of A (1-42) as measured by ELISA (ThermoFisher).

Knockdown experiment.
The knockdown is an experimental technique by which the expression of a gene is transiently reduced, for this reason it is necessary to find out the optimal condition in which we have the maximum effect preserving the cell viability.
In HEK cells we observed that the detection should not be carried out prior to 24 hours post-transfection and in terms of gene silencing 24 hours siRNA transfection at a non-toxic concentration of 200 nM and 0.2 μL of DharmaFECT reagent were found to yield good knockdown results.
It was interesting to observe also how the gene expression started to recover after 24 hours, even if still under treatment, and also when the transfection medium was replaced with complete medium and incubated for further 24 hours.
Like other GPI-anchored proteins, PrP C can be released from the cell surface in vitro by the action of exogenous bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC).
PLC acute cleavage was therefore used to enhance the effect of the transient knockdown.
All reagents for the knockdown experiment, such as ON- Neuronal induction from neural progenitor cells was obtained from previously described methods with modifications.
NPCs were transferred to Poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated plates (10 μg /mL) and the medium was replaced for neuronal medium (Neurobasal medium, 1x Gibco® GlutaMAX™ Supplement, 1x B-27), supplemented with DAPT 10 μM.
The medium was changed every day for 6 days, immature neurons emerged around day 26.
On day 40 the young neurons were split with accutase onto to Poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated plates (10 μg /mL) and the medium was replaced for neuronal medium without DAPT and supplemented with 10nM of BDNF.
The cells were then fed at alternate days with neuronal medium until day 75.

NPC cells were plated at 1 × 10 4 cells per well on Poly-L-ornithine/laminincoated 96-well plates, after 3 days the cells were treated.
After the treatment the cells were fixed and stained for pFyn kinase and Alexa Fluor™ 594 Phalloidin was used as a marker that define the boundary of cells and DAPI for nuclear staining.
A quantitative imaging analysis of the NPC cells was conducted through the The Opera Phenix ™ High Content Screening System at × 40 magnification using the The Columbus™ Image analysis system.
The morphological features number of cells and number of spots per cell were assessed for both treated and control cells.
At least 15 fields were randomly selected and scanned per well of a 96-well plate in triplicate.
To identify and remove any false readings generated by the system, three random A and control wells were selected and counted manually (blind to group).
For the pTau experiment, the treatment with compounds was done concomitantly with A medium being changed after 3 days of treatment and cells were allowed to differentiate for 2 more days.
On day temperature protected from light.
The positive and negative controls were prepared under the same conditions, i.e., in PBS and the same DMSO concentrations used for the compounds: 1.25%, 2.5% or 5%.
Absorbance measurements were performed at room temperature (24 °C ± 1) with a Jasco V-560 UV/Vis double beam spectrophotometer, at room temperature using quartz cuvettes with 1 cm optical path.
Light scattering (Rayleigh) was determined by measuring the intensity of light scattered at 90º and 550 nm with a Fluorolog Model 3.22 spectrofluorimeter in right-angle geometry (Horiba Jobin Yvon) at room temperature using 1 cm
x 1 cm quartz Suprasil® cuvettes and setting both excitation and emission wavelengths to 550 nm, with a bandwidth of 1 nm.
Three independent replicates were performed for each compound at each concentration, with at least 10 measurements per replicate.

For each category, two different ratios (volume of octan-1-ol to volume of buffer) were defined as experimental parameters (Table
Results are presented as the mean  SD of three independent experiments.
If the mean of two independent experiments obtained for a given compound did not differ by more than 0.1 units, the results were accepted.

Parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA).
Effective permeability (log P e ) was determined in a 96well format with PAMPA.
For each compound, measurements were performed at pH 7. MeCN containing 0.1% formic acid.
The flow rate was maintained at 0.6 mL/min.
The gradient was ramped from 95%
A/5% B to 5% A/95% B over 1 min, and then hold at 5% A/95% B for 0.1 min.
The system was then brought back to 95% A/5% B, resulting in a total duration of 4 min.
MS parameters such as fragmentor voltage, collision energy and polarity were optimized individually for each drug, and the molecular ion was followed for each compound in the multiple reaction monitoring mode.
The concentrations of the analytes were quantified by the Agilent Mass Hunter Quantitative Analysis software (version B.01.04).

Paragon Plus EnvironmentJournal of Medicinal ChemistryWe were able to test the Aos binding to the prion protein in both HEK 293 cell line with endogenous or "high" PrP C expression (Figure4, C2) and "low" PrP C expression through siRNA knockdown (Figure4, C3).
The two populations were treated with the same concentration (1 x 10 3 pg/mL) of Aos for 2 hours.
Cells were then washed and stained with anti-Aos antibodies and imaged by ImageXpress Micro Widefield High Content Screening System (Figure4, C).
It is clearly seen that the binding of Aos to cell surface is PrP C dependent, i.e.
Aos binds to PrP C on the cell surface.

Trihydroxy-2-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)benzene (13).
To a solution of 2,3,4,6-tetra-Obenzyl-α-/β-D-glucopyranose (2 g, 3.70 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (50 mL), 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone (0.93 g, 7.40 mmol, 2 eq.) in dry MeCN (50 mL) was added, together with drierite (0.25 g), under N 2 atmosphere.
The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature, which was then lowered to -78 ºC.
TMSOTf (0.68 mL, 3.70 mmol, 1 eq.) was added in a dropwise manner.
After stirring for 30 minutes, the mixture was left at room temperature under stirring overnight.
The reaction was stopped by adding a few drops of triethylamine; then, dichloromethane was evaporated and the mixture was washed with brine and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 mL).
The organic layers were combined, dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated under vacuum.
The residue was purified by column chromatography (10:Cyclohexane/Acetone), affording compound 13 in 42% yield as a colorless oil.

Samples (150 μL) were withdrawn from each well to determine the blank spectra by UV/Visspectroscopy (190 to 500 nm, SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, CA, USA).
Then, analyte dissolved in DMSO (10 mM) was added to the remaining buffer to yield 50 μM solutions.
To exclude precipitation, the optical density (OD) was measured at 650 nm, and solutions exceeding OD 0.01 were filtrated.
Afterwards, samples (150 μL) were withdrawn to determine the reference spectra.
Further 200 μL were transferred to each well of the donor plate of the PAMPA sandwich (pIon, P/N 110 163).
The filter membranes at the bottom of the acceptor plate were infused with 5 μL of GIT-0 Lipid Solution and 200 μL of Acceptor Sink Buffer were filled into each acceptor well.
The sandwich was assembled, placed in the GutBoxTM, and left undisturbed for 16 h.
Then, it was disassembled and samples (150 μL) were transferred from each donor and acceptor well to UV-plates for determination of the UV/Vis spectra.
Effective permeability (log Pe) was calculated from the compound flux deduced from the spectra, the filter area, and the initial sample concentration in the donor well with the aid of the PAMPA Explorer Software (pIon, version 3.5).LC-MS measurements.Analyses were performed using a 1100/1200 Series HPLC System coupled to a 6410 Triple Quadrupole mass detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with electrospray ionization.The system was controlled with the Agilent MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition software (version B.01.04).
The column used was an AtlantisR T3 C18 column (2.1 x 50 mm) with a 3 μm-particle size (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA).
The mobile phase consisted of eluent A: 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.0 in 95:5, H 2 O:MeCN; and eluent B:

isoflavone core does not disrupt the binding towards hIAPP.This result opens the door to further exploit this compound as a molecular probe against IAPP-induced pancreatic failure and IAPP-promoted cross-seeding events with A.Even though it is not the right option when it comes to glucosidase or cholinesterase inhibition, our investigation revealed that compound 21 is effective in the prevention of A-induced Fyn activation.Yet, we herein disclose that much simpler C-glucosyl polyphenols embody the right scaffold to tackle the chain of processes culminating in Tau hyperphosphorylation.One of these compounds is 9, embodying a per-O-methylglucosyl C-C linked to 2,4,6trihydroxyacetophenone.It was found to inhibit A-induced Fyn kinase activation, and to consequently reduce the levels of hyperphosphorylated Tau.Moreover, it has the right balance between effective permeability and lipophilicity to be orally available and brain penetrant, as revealed in PAMPA and log D 7.4 determination assays.With the additional advantage of being efficiently synthesized in only 2 steps, our results indicate that 9 should indeed be regarded as a new promising scaffold for further development against A-induced Tau pathology in AD.Ultimately, this study strongly evidences the potential of glucosylpolyphenols as therapeutic agents against AD and T2D and offers several lead structures with different hydroxylation pattern and adequate physicochemical profiles for further development against relevant therapeutic targets for both diseases.
Very importantly, it shows, for the first time, that C-glucosyl polyphenols are promising scaffolds able to tackle A-induced Fyn kinase activation with enough efficacy to reduce Tau phosphorylation, thus having the potential to change the paradigm of drug discovery against AD and DID.
