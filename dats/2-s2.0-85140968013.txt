Perivascular spaces as a potential biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly damaging disease that affects one's cognition and memory and presents an increasing societal and economic burden globally.
Considerable research has gone into understanding AD; however, there is still a lack of effective biomarkers that aid in early diagnosis and intervention.
The recent discovery of the glymphatic system and associated Perivascular Spaces (PVS) has led to the theory that enlarged PVS (ePVS) may be an indicator of AD progression and act as an early diagnostic marker.
Visible on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), PVS appear to enlarge when known biomarkers of AD, amyloid-β and tau, accumulate.
The central goal of ePVS and AD research is to determine when ePVS occurs in AD progression and if ePVS are causal or epiphenomena.
Furthermore, if ePVS are indeed causative, interventions promoting glymphatic clearance are an attractive target for research.
However, it is necessary first to ascertain where on the pathological progression of AD ePVS occurs.
This review aims to examine the knowledge gap that exists in understanding the contribution of ePVS to AD.
It is essential to understand whether ePVS in the brain correlate with increased regional tau distribution and global or regional Amyloid-β distribution and to determine if these spaces increase proportionally over time as individuals experience neurodegeneration.
This review demonstrates that ePVS are associated with reduced glymphatic clearance and that this reduced clearance is associated with an increase in amyloid-β.
However, it is not yet understood if ePVS are the outcome or driver of protein accumulation.
Further, it is not yet clear if ePVS volume and number change longitudinally.
Ultimately, it is vital to determine early diagnostic criteria and early interventions for AD to ease the burden it presents to the world; ePVS may be able to fulfill this role and therefore merit further research.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with approximately 10 million people diagnosed each year globally
It is anticipated that there will be approximately 150 million cases of dementia worldwide by 2050, with 60-80% likely attributed to AD
Despite this, no effective treatments are available, and AD diagnosis is confirmed only on autopsy
AD presents an enormous societal and economic burden globally, and the critical question is how early pathology can be identified and how potential treatments can promote positive patient outcomes.
Alzheimer's disease proteins have long been the target of AD research, most notably Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau.
Recent research has determined that while these proteins are implicated in the pathophysiology of AD, mechanisms by which Aβ and tau accumulate in the brain are thought to be due to the impaired clearance of proteins and other toxins by the glymphatic system
Further investigation is needed regarding this system's role in AD pathophysiology as a diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in AD (and other proteinopathies).

Alzheimer's disease
Diagnosis of a cognitive disorder requires the patient to present with progressive impairment in one or more cognitive domains
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the transitional stage between normal cognition and impaired cognition (dementia)
According to the diagnostic criteria, individuals are diagnosed with MCI when presenting with cognitive changes; however, functional abilities remain
When impairment progresses to a level with a significant impact on social or occupational function, a dementia diagnosis is given
AD diagnosis occurs when the patient presents with severe progressive impairment in several cognitive domains, which interfere with everyday functioning and independence, as well as positive to the known AD biomarkers

The classification includes an imaging and CSF option to allow maximum inclusion if patient data is missing
diagnosis can be increased by supporting biomarker datathe ATN classification, as shown in Table
This system was designed to contain two biomarkers in each category, a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and an imaging biomarker
These biomarkers have been included to allow the use of the ATN classification system when there was imaging or biomarker data available, without needing both
Patients can be diagnosed with possible or probable AD depending on the symptom presentation (Table
Furthermore, as described in Table
Pathologically, AD is characterized by Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and atrophy
It is currently understood that Aβ plaques develop over many years without associated or significant cognitive decline
In comparison, the accumulation of tau, phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and NFTs tend to coincide with the presentation of cognitive issues
Brain atrophy, beyond what is associated with normal aging, is also seen in AD
Ventricular enlargement and volume loss occur in temporal gray matter and orbitofrontal and temporal cortices, including the hippocampus, and act as reliable biomarkers of AD progression
Hippocampal volume loss appears most characteristically in MCI individuals and can predict the likelihood of AD progression
Notably,
Subsequent studies showed that accelerated decline from MCI into dementia only occurred with the presence of p-tau
Such findings suggest that there is a synergistic interaction between Aβ and p-tau that promotes volume loss and therefore accelerates cognitive decline more significant than what is seen in normal aging individuals.

Amyloid-beta pathology
Amyloid-β, a primary pathological hallmark of AD, exists as a transmembrane protein in the brain and is produced from the cleaving of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)
APP possesses a single membrane spanning domain, a large N-terminus and short C-terminus
APP undergoes two proteolytic cleavages, resulting in different fragments with differing pathologies
APP cleaved first by β-secretase produces N-and C-terminal moieties
These moieties are again cleaved by γ-secretase in the endocytic compartment to form Aβ40 and Aβ42
These final Aβ monomers can aggregate in a number of ways, including oligomers, protofibrils and Aβ fibrils
Aβ fibrils are insoluble and large and can further aggregate in Aβ plaques, while Aβ oligomers are soluble and spread globally through the brain
Several studies have suggested that truncated forms of Aβ aggregate and correlate with disease severity and progression
It has been suggested that microglia play a key role in the degradation of both Aβ forms
And it is further postulated that this degradation may cause the activation or production of toxic molecules that could then go on to affect the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) or PVS, promoting disease progression
Genetic forms of AD, which lead to early onset, are associated with mutations in APP or Presenilin 1/2, exacerbating Aβ accumulation
This knowledge suggests that Aβ mutations or dysfunction promote AD onset; therefore, therapies targeting Aβ removal would prevent disease onset.
As such, the removal of Aβ plaques has long been investigated as a potential AD treatment.
However, these Aβtargeted interventions have had limited success in delaying cognitive decline even when Aβ removal was successful
Amyloid-β is a commonly synthesized and secreted protein
Aβ40 is produced in higher concentrations, though Aβ42 is most prevalent in plaques
In AD, Aβ42 aggregates into plaques, and the brain's clearance system cannot clear the proteins into the CSF.
This aggregation explains the decrease of Aβ42 in CSF in AD compared to Cognitively Normal (CN) controls while Aβ40 levels remain consistent across diagnoses
Due to these established changes over time, the CSF Aβ40:Aβ42 ratio has been implicated as a good     The time-course of amyloid-β and tau spread.

Finally, these regions become severely affected (VI).

measure of AD progression.
PET studies have demonstrated that utilizing this ratio is a more effective and reliable measure than using the decrease in CSF Aβ42 alone
It is well-established that Aβ accumulation begins many years prior to the onset of AD symptoms and that people can have an excess of Aβ in their brains without cognitive symptoms.
Many other hypotheses in the literature attempt to explain the pathologic processes that occur through AD; however, the Aβ hypothesis has the most support currently
The Aβ hypothesis posits that the excess of Aβ initiates further pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the onset of neurodegeneration and disease symptoms
Despite the Aβ hypothesis being dominant for the last 30 years, excess Aβ in a substantial proportion of CN people and the failure of Aβ targeting therapies to impact AD suggest other mechanisms are at work.
This theory has been elegantly illustrated by "the Jack curve" (Figure

Tau pathology
In healthy brains, tau binds to microtubules to aid stability and promote axonal transport in neurons as a microtubuleassociated protein (MAP)
This axonal stability is regulated through a balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tau
Disruption of this balance is observed in AD, and hyperphosphorylation of tau is able to occur
Phosphorylation of tau is known to affect its solubility, localization, function, interactions, and susceptibility to further post-translational modification
As such, it is suggested that abnormal phosphorylation causes the loss of tau's positive charge, leading to a formation change and ultimately causing detachment from the microtubules
Once detached, tau is free to move toward the neuronal soma, where it can accumulate as aggregated tau and eventually form NFTs
It appears that the tau pathogenesis in AD involves both hyperphosphorylation and predominantly N-terminal truncation of tau
The tau aggregation mechanism is still unknown; however, numerous findings suggest that aggregated tau acts as seeds that spread in a prion-like mechanism and trigger tau aggregation in surrounding cells
This prion-like mechanism suggests that abnormal tau "seeds" from the donor transfer to a recipient, causing the recipient to become abnormal and go on to act like a donor
Accumulation of intraneuronal tau tangles is a common hallmark of AD
This seeding hypothesis follows the Braak staging mechanism of NFTs
Neurofibrillary tangles are the aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau that form intra-neuronally before becoming extra-neuronal
Interestingly this set pattern of progression has also been closely associated with cognitive stage and disease progression long after Aβ has aggregated globally (Figure
As such, it is hypothesized that the toxic nature of tau arises from its ability to sequester normal MAPs when phosphorylated; this disrupts the microtubule network, eventually leading to neurodegeneration
When tau disruption becomes substantial, there is significant detachment from axons, allowing tau to be released into the CSF and NFT formation.
Mounting evidence suggests that Aβ and tau work together in AD progression, rather than Aβ causing the aggregation of tau as hypothesized by the Aβ cascade hypothesis

The time-course of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers
The relative time-course of these Aβ and tau pathologies and their contributions to AD presentation have been consolidated and presented by
Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to examine MCI patients who progressed to AD, this team showed that Aβ burden was not related to the risk of AD progression
To date, AD therapies have targeted each of the biomarkers of the Jack curve without success; therefore, alternative therapeutic targets (and biomarkers of disease progression) are needed.
The glymphatic system presents a new diagnostic and therapeutic target for AD.

Glymphatic system
The glymphatic system is the brain's clearance pathway; this system removes waste products and transports solutes throughout the brain via CSF
CSF makes up a large proportion of the total fluid volume within the mammalian head and flows throughout the four ventricles and subarachnoid space
From the subarachnoid space, the CSF penetrates the brain parenchyma via the PVS
After flowing into the brain, CSF passes through AQP4 channels and mixes with interstitial fluid (ISF) (Figure
AQP4 channels are selective water channels located on astrocyte end-feet that allow the mixing of CSF and ISF
This mixture can then leave the brain through perivenous space and eventually out into the lymphatic vessels in the meninges and the lymphatics in the neck
Imaging studies have demonstrated the importance of this system in the clearance of Aβ and other proteins from the brain
One such study demonstrated, through MRI and PET imaging, that ventricular CSF clearance was impaired in AD and related to increase Aβ deposits
This team replicated this finding again in 2022 with a larger sample size
Additionally, a recent study by
Cerebrospinal fluid moves alongside the blood vessels in the brain; solutes, such as glucose, are delivered to regions where needed, while waste metabolites are removed to maintain homeostasis (Figure
The CSF is propelled alongside the blood vessels through the pulsation of arterial walls
This pulsation was first observed by
The team labeled CSF with fluorescent tracers, which were injected into the cisterna magna of mice
This study subsequently showed that CSF enters the brain along the cortical pial arteries, followed by CSF entry into the PVS along the penetrating arterioles (Figure
Crucially, this study showed that CSF did not spread diffusely or randomly in the parenchyma as previously believed; instead, it followed a pattern that mirrored the brain vasculature
Further studies are now beginning to demonstrate that impairment of the brain's glymphatic drainage system is likely related to several neurodegenerative diseases
Fluorescent Aβ was injected into the striatum of mice, which was then shown to be removed through para-venous efflux
Furthermore, they found that AQP4 knockout mice showed a 65% reduction in CSF efflux compared to wild-type mice; this further reduced Aβ clearance by up to 55%
These findings demonstrate the importance of an effective and functioning glymphatic system in Aβ clearance from the brain.

Other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and the glymphatic system
Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a subunit of neurofilaments that confer structural stability in neurons and allow the radial growth of axons
In AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, NfL is elevated in both the CSF and Plasma and therefore acts as a general marker of neurodegeneration
Although these measures are a sensitive marker for neurodegeneration, they are not specific to AD
The relationship between NfL and glymphatic clearance in AD has yet to be investigated.
Serum/CSF NfL ratio has been found to be lower in patients who have experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage versus controls which is hypothesized to be due to reduced glymphatic efflux
Another team showed that following subarachnoid hemorrhage, patients undergo AQP4 mislocalization, similar to those with AD, and show tau accumulation as the result of this mislocalization

Reduced glymphatic function risk factors Apolipoprotein E4
Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the most decisive genetic risk factor for AD development
The APOE gene is responsible for lipid transport and repair in the brain as a cholesterol carrier
There are three dominant forms of the APOE gene, which vary in their ability to predispose an individual to AD.
This gene exists as E2, E3, and E4 variants and has a frequency of 8.4, 77.9, and 13.7%, respectively (Figure
The E4 allele predisposes one to an increased risk of AD development, four times higher for those who are heterozygous for the APOE4 mutation and twelve times higher for those homozygous for the APOE4 mutation
APOE4 carriers have increased cerebrovascular Aβ angiopathy due to increased deposition of Aβ at the vessel walls
This finding implicates APOE4 in the dysregulation of Aβ metabolism, allowing it to be deposited extracellularly as plaques, which supports previous findings
Additionally, it has been shown that APOE4 carriers have increased degradation of the BBB and brain pericytes

Sleep
Sleep disturbance is a commonly reported symptom of AD patients
Disturbance includes insomnia, poor sleep quality, or reduced sleep quantity
Many papers have demonstrated the need for adequate The glymphatic system.
This system aids in the brain's transport, movement, and removal of solutes.
(A) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enters via para-arterial spaces (red) and mixes with interstitial fluid (ISF)
The CSF-ISF mix enters the para-venous space through the AQP4 channels and exits via the para-venous efflux pathway (blue)
(B) Neurovascular Unit.
Complex unit, with astrocyte end-feet enclosing the blood vessels
(C) Blood-Brain Barrier exchange of metabolites to maintain brain homeostasis
sleep to allow glymphatic clearance
It can therefore be hypothesized that sleep quality is critical for glymphatic clearance efficiency.
A stand-out paper by
The team discovered that the interstitial space in sleeping and anesthetized mice increased by 60%, resulting in a dramatic increase in convective exchange between CSF and ISF
This increased turnover resulted in an increased Aβ clearance during sleep, suggesting that sleep increases glymphatic system clearance
Ultimately, there is likely a bidirectional relationship between sleep and AD, in which poor sleep impacts the effectiveness of the glymphatic system, allowing Aβ and tau to accumulate, which worsens dementia symptoms and exacerbates sleep disturbances.
Apolipoprotein (APOE) distribution in the glymphatic system.
This schematic depicts the convective flow that occurs around an artery and toward the venous space.
APOE is responsible for lipid transport and repair in the brain
APOE is delivered around the arteries, and density depends on the alleles present, with APOE4 having the greatest density near the artery (A)
Figure from
Furthermore, APOE has been implicated as an essential factor linking sleep disturbance and AD.
A study by
Additionally, APOE4 carriers show a two-times increase in disordered breathing during sleep compared to non-carrier individuals
The increased incidence of AD among APOE4 carriers may result from their increased level of disordered sleep.
Moreover, APOE4 carriers may have increased Aβ build-up in the brain's sleep centers, and therefore it could be hypothesized that the body may begin to struggle to produce restorative sleep, compounding the issue.
As such, a feedforward loop may be occurring with the driving factor of APOE4 leading to poor sleep, thus reducing glymphatic clearance, allowing Aβ build-up and driving worse sleep.

Aquaporin 4 water channel
Aquaporin-4 water channel channels are critical features of the glymphatic system, and their function is required to effectively remove toxins from the brain
This selective water channel maintains ionic and osmotic homeostasis within the brain
These channels are localized to astrocytes and ependymal cells, with the most extensive presence on the end-feet of perivascular astrocytes (Figure
Loss of localization occurs when AQP4 loses its polarity and becomes broadly associated with the entire astrocyte
This mislocalization of AQP4 is known to occur in normal aging and excessively in AD
Aquaporin-4 water channel has been shown to play an important role in the removal of Aβ from the brain parenchyma
One such study determining that inhibition of AQP4 decreases Aβ drainage from around cerebral vessels
However, this paper did not investigate Aβ42, as Aβ40 is the soluble form of Aβ.
However, one study was able to demonstrate, through postmortem histological analysis, that non-demented subjects showed a reduced end-feet AQP4 localization on capillaries that was associated with increases in soluble and insoluble Aβ40 and soluble Aβ42
Furthermore, reduced end-feet AQP4 localization on large vessels was associated with increases in soluble Aβ40 and soluble Aβ42
Although causality cannot be conferred as this is a postmortem study, these recent findings were only present in non-demented subjects (not those with AD) which suggests that AQP4 mislocalization is occurring early in the AD disease continuum.
The team concluded that these Aβ deposits at the PVS were likely particularly harmful to cognition as they compromised end-foot function and, therefore, the homeostatic function of astrocytes
However, this finding remains controversial whether AQP4 mislocalization is the cause or consequence of Aβ deposition.
Several other studies have shown that AQP4 mislocalization suppresses glymphatic clearance and is the cause of Aβ accumulation
Opposing findings such as this may suggest a feedforward relationship where Aβ can accumulate due to other problems with the glymphatic system, which causes AQP4 mislocalization, further promoting Aβ accumulation
Additionally, AQP4 mutations have been shown to promote sleep disturbances
A study by Rainey-Smith et al. (
Another recent study on Parkinson's disease demonstrated that specific mutations in AQP4 were likely the cause of sleep disturbance and may act as a prognostic marker for cognitive decline
Conversely, some studies have found that sleep disturbance results in AQP4 mislocalization; one such study found that mice who were sleep deprived showed AQP4 mislocalization away from astrocyte end-feet
In agreement with this finding,
So, again, it is unclear if AQP4 mislocalization causes poor sleep or if poor sleep causes abnormal expression of AQP4.
The APOE4 and AQP4 haplotypes may lie very early on the Jack curve (Figure
Genetic variants in AQP4 and APOE4, which influence gene expression and increase the risk of progression to dementia, may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to cognitive decline and dementia in the context of sleep
These alterations in normal biology may ultimately disrupt the effectiveness of the glymphatic system, promoting an individual's vulnerability to developing AD.
This relationship warrants further investigation to gain clarification and understand whether these markers could aid in early intervention and treatment.

Aging
Finally, aging is known to significantly influence the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD (Figure
With aging comes degeneration in neurons, Aβ plaques, astrocyte and microglia dysfunction and AQP4 mislocalization, ultimately leading to a reduction in protein waste removal (Figure
Moreover, aging is related to a drastic decline in the efficiency of exchange between CSF and the brain parenchyma in mice
Older mice had a 40% reduction in Aβ clearance compared to young mice and a 27% loss in vessel pulse ability and loss of AQP4 polarization
Thus, the team proposed that cognitive decline associated with aging is also associated with impaired glymphatic clearance and may be a target for neurodegenerative disorder treatment
Furthermore, findings such as this may suggest that the elasticity of PVS is significantly decreased with age, and a reduction in pulse ability of the PVS may suggest why age is associated with enlarged PVS.

Perivascular spaces as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease
Part of the glymphatic pathway, PVS are the small fluidfilled spaces through which CSF flows in and out of the brain.
These spaces surround arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins, and venule walls as they pass from the subarachnoid space to the parenchyma
Two molecules of differing molecular weight were injected into the rat intrathecal space and observed with MRI.
Both molecules passed through the para-arterial space, but the smaller molecule entered more extensively into the brain parenchyma
Interestingly, this finding points toward a size-selective nature of the PVS when clearing molecules from the brain.
Moreover, this may suggest why large molecules found in AD, such as Aβ plaques, are deposited around blood vessels, as they simply cannot enter and be clear from the PVS
Stagnation of the PVS occurs when there is insufficient flow of CSF through these spaces, causing them to expand, trap fluid and become visible on MRI (Figure
Although enlarged PVS (ePVS) are a typical sign of aging, it is also established that neurodegeneration increases the prevalence and severity of ePVS
ePVS may function as indicators for disease initiation and progression as these spaces must be functional to maintain homeostasis and remove excess metabolites, such as those that form Aβ plaques and NFTs
The team utilized a radiolabeled approach and intracisternal injection of Aβ40 and inulin (reference molecule) to determine that Aβ influx was reduced with aging and in mice models of AD
The same approach then quantified Aβ clearance, and it was found that there was greater inulin clearance compared to Aβ; this suggests that the slower clearance time of Aβ increases the time that Aβ can interact with endogenous Aβ plaques, promoting further accumulation
While this is not a direct measurement of glymphatic problems preceding Aβ accumulation, the team believed that the data suggested that glymphatic clearance is altered in AD and occurs before the significant presence of Aβ
This team also hypothesized that restoring glymphatic efficiency and PVS dynamics may be a potential treatment for slowing AD progression
ePVS were quantified using a pre-defined slice from a T1/2/2 * MRI and FLAIR (Fluid attenuated inversion recovery) images
An adjusted analysis found that the severity of ePVS in the centrum semi-ovale was associated with AD, while the severity of ePVS in the basal ganglia was associated with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment
However, they did not find an association between MRI visible ePVS and Aβ-PET (using Pittsburgh compound B).
This team noted that their study would have been improved with the use of CSF biomarkers of Aβ to ensure that the Aβ-PET signal was not measuring only parenchymal Aβ but also vascular Aβ
Nonetheless, this study gives supporting evidence for using ePVS in the centrum semi-ovale as an imaging marker for AD, although it is not likely a measure of Aβ-PET positivity in patients
This finding suggests a diurnal variation in the caliber of the PVS, which are smaller during sleep and enlarged during the day.
Furthermore, this ability to change in caliber decreases as neurovascular compliance decreases with aging, so the PVS will gradually lose the ability to change in caliber as we age and remain permanently dilated

Amyloid-beta and perivascular spaces
It has been demonstrated that the glymphatic pathway and associated PVS are important in Aβ clearance.
Studies by
These knockout mice could not effectively clear Aβ, resulting in memory deficits
These results were supported by
Furthermore, the disruption of AQP4 localization, as seen in AD, can increase Aβ pathology
Issues with AQP4 are associated with AD pathology and cognitive function, suggesting that AQP4 localization may be a key driver in disease progression
Another recent study determined, using ex vivo MRI on humans, that ePVS were located mainly in the white matter portion of perforating cortical arterioles
They showed reduced small muscle cells and increased vascular Aβ that extended into the white matter, which individually affected vessels with ePVS
Thus, their results were consistent with the current theory that ePVS reflect an impaired outward flow along the arterioles that PVS follow

Tau and perivascular spaces
Studies have demonstrated that both p-tau and total-tau (ttau) burden are associated with ePVS.
Many believe that tau is cleared through intracellular degradation
Another study determined that NFT pathology was a good correlate for ePVS burden in patients with AD and vascular lesion AD compared to controls
By measuring postmortem ePVS and AQP4 expression using immunofluorescence, this team also found that AD patients had increased AQP4 expression but a reduced localization to the astrocyte endfeet
These patients also showed an increased tau and Aβ burden associated with an increase in ePVS
Both studies also support
A more recent study in normal patients with AD pathological biomarkers utilized an ePVS visual rating score to suggest that impairment in glymphatic clearance could contribute to tau accumulation through microglia neuroinflammation processes
In a large cross-section study, PVS distribution was found to be different in individuals with MCI compared to CN participants, with a higher PVS volume fraction in the centrum semi-ovale of the white matter
Further, it was shown that a lower PVS volume fraction in the medial temporal lobe was correlated to a more significant aggregation of tau NFTs in the adjacent entorhinal cortex
The team hypothesized that the observed decrease in PVS volume fraction in the medial temporal lobe might represent occlusion of PVS prior to enlargement
In opposition to these findings,
In 39 individuals with AD, CSF levels of Aβ42, p-tau, t-tau, neuroinflammatory markers, and Aβ-PET were not associated with PVS
To date, the role of ePVS in the development and progression of AD has yet to be established.
We hypothesize that the impairment of glymphatic clearance via perivascular spaces is an early pathophysiologic mechanism that leads to Aβ and tau deposition in the brain.
The interaction between ePVS, AD, and associated genetic and lifestyle risk factors needs further elucidation to determine the potential of ePVS as both an early diagnostic biomarker of neurodegeneration and a target for more effective therapeutic interventions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the glymphatic system and its associated PVS are of great interest in AD.
Understanding more about AD and its underlying mechanisms is key to early intervention and effective treatment.
Recent findings regarding APOE4 and AQP4 haplotypes, as well as the effect of sleep on PVS, demonstrate the complex nature of this neurodegenerative disease.
Enlarged PVS have the potential as a biomarker able to predict the chance of neurodegeneration through to AD; additionally, they may be able to demonstrate disease progression and severity.
Furthermore, these spaces and the glymphatic system more generally may be a potential target for treatment, with the promotion of glymphatic clearance potentially delaying AD-associated cognitive decline.
