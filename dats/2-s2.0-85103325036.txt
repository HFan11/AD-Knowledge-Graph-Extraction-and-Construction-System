Tetramethylpyrazine Improves Cognitive Impairment and Modifies the Hippocampal Proteome in Two Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, has no effective treatment.
We studied the potential effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an alkaloid in the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.
used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (chu ānxiong) to treat ischemic stroke, on AD progression in two AD mouse models.
Eight-month-old 3xTg-AD mice received TMP treatment (10 mg/kg/d) for 1 month, and 4-month-old APP/PS1-AD mice received TMP treatment (10 mg/kg/d) for 2 months.
Behavioral tests, including step-down passive avoidance (SDA), new object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Contextual fear conditioning test showed that TMP significantly improved the learning and memory of the two AD-transgenic mice.
In addition, TMP reduced beta-amyloid (Aß) levels and tau phosphorylation (p-tau).
Venny map pointed out that 116 proteins were commonly changed in 3xTg mice vs. wild type (WT) mice and TMP-treated mice vs. -untreated mice.
The same 130 proteins were commonly changed in APP/PS1 mice vs. WT mice and TMP-treated mice vs. -untreated mice.
The functions of the common proteins modified by TMP in the two models were mainly involved in mitochondrial, synaptic, cytoskeleton, ATP binding, and GTP binding.
Mitochondrial omics analysis revealed 21 and 20 differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins modified by TMP in 3xTg-AD mice and APP/PS1 mice, respectively.
These differential proteins were located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial gap, and mitochondrial matrix, and the function of some proteins is closely related to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
Western-blot analysis confirmed that TMP changed the expression of OXPHOS complex proteins (sdhb, ndufa10, uqcrfs1, cox5b, atp5a)  in the hippocampus of the two AD mice.
Taken together, we demonstrated that TMP treatment changed the hippocampal proteome, reduced AD pathology, and reduced cognitive Huang et al.
Tetramethylpyrazine Improves Cognitive Impairment impairment in the two AD models.
The changes might be associated with modification of the mitochondrial protein profile by TMP.
The results of the study suggest that TMP can improve the symptoms of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of neurodegenerative dementia, has a huge impact on the health system
The amount of patients with AD is increasing dramatically in aging populations worldwide, such that identification of effective therapeutics is a top priority for society
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is featured by prominent neuropathological changes, including β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed from hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau).
The pathogenesis of AD has suggested various hypthotheses including roles for inflammation, cholinergic function, Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction
As for AD treatment, prior to 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration approved only six drugs market use
Other more effective medicines are urgently needed to address the growing AD patient load.
We studied the potential effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an alkaloid in the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (chuānxiong) to treat ischemic stroke, on AD progression in two AD mouse models.
Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), a type of calcium antagonist, is an alkaloid extracted from the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, which has been widely used in Chinese Traditional Medicine.
According to reports in the literature, TMP has shown a strong neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia models
In the rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by systemic treatment with methylphenyltetrahydrodpyridine, TMP has a neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons
Additionally, TMP reversed streptozotocin-induced memory impairment by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)
Taken in concert, these data suggest that TMP may have a potential therapeutic effect via neuroprotection.
We therefore studied the potential neuroprotective effect of TMP on AD and its molecular mechanism through the use of two validated AD mouse models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and Treatment Protocol
Animals used included: (a) triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) (B6; 129-Psen1 tm1Mpm Tg [APPSwe, tauP301L] 1Lfa/Mmjax) and wild-type (WT) mice (B6129SF2/J) and (b) APPswe/PSEN 1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice and matched wild-type (WT) animals (APP/PS1-negative mice).
Mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory in the United States, delivered by air to Shenzhen, and bred locally at the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control.
Animal housing, breeding, and experimental studies used standards employed for breeding laboratory animals.
Eight-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were treated by gavage with 10 mg/kg/d TMP (10 mg/kg/d) in saline for 1 month.
Eight-month-old WT mice and untreated 3xTg-AD mice were given normal saline by the same route.
Additionally, 4-month-old APP/PS1-positive mice were treated by gavage with 10 mg/kg/d TMP (TMP+10 mg/kg/d) in saline for 2 months, and 4-month-old negative mice and untreated positive mice were given normal saline (Figure
The experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
Every effort was made to reduce the suffering of the animals and the number of mice.

Behavioral Tests

Cognition Test
We performed a new object recognition (NOR) test using a previously published method
On the first day, mice were conditioned to move freely in an empty plastic box for 5 min.
After 24 h of training, the mice were placed back in the same box with two objects of the same size and shape and allowed to explore freely for 5 min.
After 1 h, one of the objects was replaced with a new object of the same size but different shape, and the mice were allowed to explore freely for another 5 min.
Simultaneous video and tracking documented the detection time of each object.
Detection was defined as the mouse facing the object, sniffing or touching with the nose, and the distance was recorded from the nose to the object ≤2 cm.
The calculation method was: (time to explore new objects)/(time to explore new objects + time to explore old objects) * 100%.

Step-Down Passive Avoidance Test
We used step-down passive avoidance (SDA) test to assess aversive learning and memory in the models
The device consisted of five glass rooms with length, width and height of 15 × 15 × 46 cm 3 .
The floors were spaced 1 cm apart and a platform with a diameter of 4.5 cm was placed in the middle.
On day one, the mouse was placed into the electrical stimulation box and electrical stimulation administered to the animal.
The response time for the animal to jump onto platform and number of platforms used was recorded (error number).
After 24 h, the mouse was directly placed on the platform and the time (latency) and error times of the mouse jumping off the platform for the first time were recorded.
After the behavioral assessment, the brain removed and the hippocampus isolated for proteomic analysis.
Protein samples from the brains of 6 mice per group (WT mice, 3xTg mice, and TMP-treated mice) were collected.
Protein samples from the brains of 3 mice of each group (WT mice, APP/PS1 mice, and TMP-treated mice) were collected.
The peptides were further graded with 6-plex TMT and HPRP and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Bioinformatics analysis (heat map, GO, String, and Wikipathway) was performed with David 6.8 and Cytoscape software.

Morris Water Maze Test
We used the Morris water maze (MWM) test according to a previously published method to evaluate the spatial learning and memory abilities of mice
The water maze consists of a circular pool and a white escape platform; the pool is filled with opaque water and has a white escape platform with a diameter of 10 cm under the water surface.
If the platform was found by the animal within 1 min of water immersion, the time to platform was recorded; if the platform was not found within 1 min, the animal was helped to find the platform and allowed to stay there for 15 s.
The training lasted for 5 days, starting from the four starting positions, and performed four times a day, with an interval of 15 s.
Animal performance was tested on the seventh day after training.
The times of crossing the platform area, time on the platform, activity track, activity time, and distance of target quadrant were all recorded.

Contextual Fear Conditioning Test
Previously reported methods were used to conduct the conditional fear experiment
In short, the fear regulator consists of a conditioning chamber.
The sound chamber is closed by silencers and the noise is shielded by exhaust fans.
The infrared digital camera is placed at the top of the enclosure, about 50 cm from the chamber.
On the first day of training, the mice explored freely for 2 min without any stimulation.
The loudspeaker (4 Hz, 80 dB) was started and stopped after 30 s. Electrical stimulation (0.5 mA) was started 2.5 s later and ended after 1 s.
The mice were exposed to no stimulation for 2 min and then the entire procedure was repeated three times.
The chamber was cleaned with 70% alcohol 24 h after training.
The mice were exposed to the changed environment for 11 min.
The training included 2 min of free exploration, 60 s of speaker (4 Hz, 80 dB), and three repetitions.
Fourty-eight hours after the training in the original training room.
The mice were left in the same room and allow to explore for 6 min without any electrical or sound stimulation.

Protein Extraction and Digestion

Hippocampal tissue of mice was dispersed in 8 M urea phosphate buffer solution by ultrasound and then centrifuged.
The hippocampus of 3xTg mice (6 mice in each group) was mixed into 100 µg protein according to (1:1:1:1:1:1).
The hippocampal proteins of APP/PS1 mice (three in each group) were similarly taken in 100 µg protein.
Protein samples were incubated with 10 mM 1,4-Dithiothreitol (DTT) at 55 • C for 30 min and then with 25 mM diamine iodoacetate (IAA) for 1 h at room temperature.
Samples were then digested with trypsin at 37 • C, adjusted to pH 1-2 by adding 1% trifluoroarboxylic acid (TFA), and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min to collect the supernatant.
Inverse phase column chromatography (HLB, Waters OASIS, USA) was used for desalting.
After desalination, samples were dried and dissolved in a buffer of triethylamine bicarbonate (TEAB, 200 mM, pH 8.5).

Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) Labeling
The samples were labeled with TMT reagent at room temperature, 5 µl 5% hydroxylamine added, and the reaction terminated after incubation.
The samples were labeled with different TMT Tags: TMT-126 for samples from WT mice; TMT-127, 3xTg mice; TMT-128, TMP-treated mice, TMT-129, APP/PS1 wild mice; TMT-130, APP/PS1-positive mice, TMT-131, TMP-treated mice.
The total peptides labeled in each group were mixed, desalted, dried, and fractionated.

LC-MS/MS Analysis and Database Searching
The labeled peptides were then loaded onto an Xbridge BEH300 C18 column (Waters, USA) and the peptide samples were separated into 15 fractions using an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
Then, fractions were dried and used for LC-MS/MS analyses.

These data suggested that TMP improved the spatial memory impairment of APP/PS1 mice.

Hierarchical Heat Map and Clustering Analysis
Hippocampal proteomics of 3xTg-AD mice identified a total of 5,390 proteins by one or more unique peptides.
Venny analysis showed that, compared with the WT mice, 3xTg mice had 268 differentially expressed proteins, while TMP-treated 3xTg mice had 296 differentially expressed proteins compared with untreated 3xTg mice, of which 116 proteins were commonly changed (standard ratio ≥1.2 or ≤0.83) (Figure

Cluster 2 mainly showed proteins with declining tendency of TMP administration; the BP of these proteins included regulation of translation, transport, Rho protein signal transduction, small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, gene silencing by RNA, neuron projection morphogenesis, and spermatogenesis.
We carried out sub-cellular localization analysis on the common changes of mitochondrial proteins.
The mitochondrial proteins were projected to the inner mitochondrial membrane, outer mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial matrix, mitochondrial space, and electron transport chain (Figures
Compared with AD mice, TMP treatment changed the expression of most mitochondrial proteins.

Enrichment Analysis of Differentially Expressed Proteins
To better understand the biological function of differentially expressed proteins, in terms of BP and MFs, we identified the top 10 enriched groups.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis of differential expressed proteins in 3xTg mice and WT mice, revealed BP involving transport, vesicle-mediated transport, astrocyte development, ion transport, aging, protein complex assembly, substantia nigra development, fibrinolysis, cellular response to organic cyclic compound, and protein transport (Figure

STRING Analysis
To evaluate the relationship between differentially expressed proteins (ratio ≥1.2 or ≤0.83), we used Cytoscape software to perform STRING analysis and to visualize protein-protein interaction networks.
Most of the proteins were interlinked, many of which were involved in AD.
The interactions of differentially expressed proteins between 3xTg and WT mice mainly included mitochondrial function, synaptic function, GTP binding, and aging (Figure

The interaction of the differential proteins between TMP treatment and APP/PS1 mice mainly included mitochondrial function, synaptic function, GTP binding (Figure

Comparison of Differential Expressed Proteins in Two AD Models After Administration
We found that 20 proteins commonly changed after TMP administration in the two AD mouse models (Figure
Among them, H1-4, Rpl14, Sncb, Krt1, Hbs1l, Sec61a1, Pex5, Cacng3 showed different trends, while the others all had the same increasing or decreasing trend (Figure
The STING diagram showed the PPI network of 20 proteins, of which only 4 proteins interacted with each other (Figure
The BP included protein transport, protein localization establishment, and protein localization (Figure

TMP Affected the Activity of Electron Transport Chain Proteins
Western-blot analysis was performed on the electron transport chain-related proteins, Complex I (NDUFA10), Complex II (SDHB), Complex III (UQCRFS1), Complex IV (COX5B), and Complex V (ATP5A).
The level of SDHB in 3xTg-AD mice was significantly modified to the level of WT mice (Figure
In APP/PS1-AD mice, SDHB and UQCRFS1 levels were modified to the level of WT mice (Figure
Compared with WT mice, ATP levels were significantly lower and MDA levels were significantly higher in APP/PS1 mice, and ATP levels were significantly higher and MDA did not change significantly after TMP treatment (Figures

TMP Inhibited APP Processing and Aβ Accumulation
Western-blot analysis showed, that compared with the WT mice, the levels of APP, BACE1, and PS1 in 3xTg mice were significantly increased and the expression of APP, BACE1, and PS1 was significantly decreased after TMP treatment (Figure
Compared with the WT mice, the levels of APP and BACE1 in APP/PS1 mice were significantly increased, while ADAM10 and IDE tended to be decreased, after TMP treatment; the expression of APP, BACE1, and PS1 was significantly reduced, but there was no significant difference in the expression of ADAM10 or IDE (Figure
Dot blot analysis showed that in the cortical tissue of the two models, compared with the WT mice, the level of 6E10 in 3xTg and APP/PS1 mice was significantly increased, while it was significantly decreased after TMP treatment (Figures
These results indicated that TMP inhibited APP processing and thus reduced the accumulation of Aβ.

TMP Reduced p-tau Levels in the Brains of AD Mice
Western-blot analysis showed that the levels of tau-5 and pS396 in 3xTg mice treated with TMP were significantly decreased compared with the untreated 3xTg mice (Figure
Similarly, the levels of tau-5, pS202, and pS396 in APP/PS1 mice treated with TMP were significantly decreased (Figure
These results indicated that TMP could reduce level of p-tau.

DISCUSSION
The 3xTg and APP/PS1 mouse models have been widely used for AD-related studies
Among them, 3xTg-AD mice had obvious Aβ deposition in the hippocampus of 3-6 month-old animals, and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) was present by 6-12 months of age
APP/PS1-AD mice may exhibit abnormal behavior and Aβ deposition starting from 4 to 6 months of age
We investigated the therapeutic effect of TMP on cognitive function in the two AD models (3xTg-AD and APP/PS1-AD) and used proteomics methods to explore its potential biological mechanisms of action.
Behavioral tests showed that TMP significantly reduced memory impairment of the two AD mouse models.
These results are consistent with previous reported studies that TMP can protect against isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats
A prominent pathological feature of AD brains is the accumulation of Aβ and NFTs composed of hyperphosphoryled tau
We found that TMP treatment significantly reduced the levels of Aβ accumulation and tau hyper phosphorylation in the two AD models relative to controls.
Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) plays an important role in APP processing and is closely related to tau protein
Our results show that TMP creduces the accumulation of Aβ by inhibiting the activity of BACE1, which could affect levels of p-tau.
We used Venny analysis, GO analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network diagram to analyze the proteomic data and to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent murine therapeutic effect of TMP.
Venny analysis showed that 116 differentially expressed proteins were commonly changed in 3xTg mice vs. WT mice and TMP-treated mice vs. untreated mice.
GO analysis showed that the 116 differential expressed proteins were mainly enriched in processes such as transportation and ion migration, and to participate in MFs such as metal ion binding and ion channel activity.
The same 130 differentially expressed proteins were commonly changed in APP/PS1 mice vs. WT mice and TMP-treated mice vs. untreated mice.
GO analysis showed that the 130 differential expressed proteins were mainly enriched in processes such as protein transport and protein localization establishment, and to participate in MFs such as protein binding and nucleotide binding.
Through proteomics analysis, some proteins functionally related to AD were found in these two mouse models, such as proteins related to mitochondria, GTP binding, synapse, and cytoskeleton.
Among them, mitochondria play a significant role in energy production, synaptic transmission, and cognitive function
Increased reactive oxygen species may impair mitochondrial function may promote neurodegenerative disease
Mitochondrial dysfunction occurred in both the 3xTg and APP/PS1 mice
The differentially expressed proteins located in the mitochondria and mapped the mitochondrial protein profile.
Most of the mitochondrial proteins were modified by TMP treatment.
For example, FUNDC1 controlled the dynamics and quality of mitochondria by regulating the fission or fusion of mitochondria
Western-blot analysis showed that TMP modified the level of mitochondrial Complex II protein SDHB in 3xTg mice and modified the level of mitochondrial Complex II protein SDHB and III protein UQCRFS1 in APP/PS1 mice.
APP and Aβ can accumulate on the mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial components to cause damage to mitochondrial function and structure
Mitochondria are central to cellular energy metabolism and the site of most ATP production
Mitochondrial dysfunction reduced ATP production in murine AD pathogenesis
The increased ATP production after TMP treatment suggested that mitochondrial function was restored in APP/PS1 mice.
Aβ, phosphorylated tau protein and the VDAC of the mitochondrial channel interact to cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and synergistic effects of Aβ and tau proteins may cause mitochondrial dysfunction
MAPT protein was identified in 3xTg by MS, which was responsible for promoting microtubule assembly and stabilization.
WB validation was consistent with proteomic results, with increased tau expression in 3xTg mice compared to WT mice, with decreased expression after TMP administration.
APP protein was identified in APP/PS1 mice by MS.
APP protein was processed to produce Aβ, which aggregates to form age spots.
The WB validation results were consistent with the proteomic results.
APP expression was increased in APP/PS1 mice compared to the WT mice and decreased after TMP administration.
Aβ and p-tau proteins can directly contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysfunctional mitochondria in turn accelerate the process of AD
It has been reported in the literature that Icariin protects mitochondria and inhibits Aβ production and p-tau protein to improve learning and memory in AD rats
In our proteomic analysis, mitochondrial proteins were significantly changed after TMP treatment, with improved electron transport chain function and increased ATP levels in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that mitochondrial function plays an important role in TMP treatment.
The reduction of Aβ and p-tau in the brains of test animals reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, and this was associated with an attenuation of the hallmarks of AD.
These data indicated that TMP may protect mitochondrial function in AD mice; this is consistent with reports that systemic TMP treatment restores mitochondrial function and reduces brain damage caused by oxidative stress and cobalt chloride (CoCl2)
Additionally, TMP can reduce oxidative damage, restore mitochondrial dysfunction and protect HUVEC cells from Hcy-induced apoptosis
Synaptic dysfunction also is important to the pathogenesis of AD.
Soluble Aβ oligomers reportedly can impair synaptic function
Proteomics showed that TMP modified the expression of some synapse-related proteins.
For example, SNAP23 played a major role in transport vesicle docking and fusion, and VAMP2 played a major role in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter release
Consistent with our results in the two mouse models of AD, VAMP2 was down-regulated in AD patients
We noticed that TMP treatment increased some cytoskeleton proteins expression, such as Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 3(Arpc3), Cofilin-1(Cof1), and Arpc3, which is mainly responsible for starting the branches of actin filaments.
Mir-29a/B can affect the ARp2/3 complex through the Arpc3 subunit, thus maintaining the flexibility of the neuronal network
Cof1 mainly regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics and plays an important role in neural cell
Our results indicated that TMP may exert a neuroprotective effect by modifying the expression of cytoskeleton proteins.
We found that TMP treatment increased brain ADPribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) the two AD model mice.
ARF6 is a GTP binding protein, mainly involved in vesicle transport, cytoskeleton, and some other functions
Activation of ARF6 contributes to the generation of synaptic vesicles in the PC12 nerve
Our results suggest that ARF6 may also be also involved in the neuroprotection of TMP.

CONCLUSION
In summary, our study of 3xTg-AD and APP/PS1-AD female mice showed that systemic TMP treatment improved memory deficits, reduced Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation levels, and modified the mitochondrial protein profile, including some oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins.
Proteomics suggested that the action of TMP may be closely related to mitochondria, synapses, GTP binding, and cytoskeleton proteins.
Although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated, our data suggest that TMP has potential for positive therapeutic modification of AD (Figure
