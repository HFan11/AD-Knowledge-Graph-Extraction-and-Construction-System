Mechanisms of Pathogenic Tau and Aβ Protein Spreading in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically defined by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides generated by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), strings of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins accumulating inside neurons known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal loss.
The association between the two hallmarks and cognitive decline has been known since the beginning of the 20th century when the first description of the disease was carried out by Alois Alzheimer.
Today, more than 40 million people worldwide are affected by AD that represents the most common cause of dementia and there is still no effective treatment available to cure the disease.
In general, the aggregation of Aβ is considered an essential trigger in AD pathogenesis that gives rise to NFTs, neuronal dysfunction and dementia.
During the process leading to AD, tau and Aβ first misfold and form aggregates in one brain region, from where they spread to interconnected areas of the brain thereby inducing its gradual morphological and functional deterioration.
In this mini-review article, we present an overview of the current literature on the spreading mechanisms of Aβ and tau pathology in AD since a more profound understanding is necessary to design therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or halting disease progression.
The tau protein is a phosphoprotein that is codified by alternative splicing of the microtubuleassociate protein tau (MAPT) gene
Of all different post-translational modifications that tau can undergo, the phosphorylation is of particular interest because of its involvement in a group of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies
Indeed, whereas phosphorylation is fundamental for tau function under physiological conditions, the affinity of tau for tubulin decreases under pathological conditions, and the protein starts to accumulate in the cytosol of the somatodendritic compartments where insoluble structures are built.
Those neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) disturb the microtubule network and alter the normal axoplasmatic flow, which in turn compromises the functions and viability of neurons
In AD, the development of NFTs evolves in the brain with a predictable and hierarchical distribution pattern that starts from layer II of the entorhinal cortex, spreads through the limbic and associations areas to finally reach the hippocampus and neocortex
Pathological tau can distribute from one cell to another thereby propagating the pathology from affected to interconnected healthy areas of the brain, implicating similar mechanisms than in prion diseases
A large number of pieces of evidence support a prion-like model for tau spreading, consisting of abnormal proteins with the capacity to convert normal proteins into a pathological form.
The inoculation of brain extracts from mice or humans with tauopathy into the brain of wild-type animals induced tau pathology in recipient animals and its propagation from the site of injection along neuronal connections
Similar results were obtained when synthetic tau fibrils were injected into young mice overexpressing mutant human tau (P301S) which resulted as well in the formation of NFT-like inclusions that propagated from the injected sites to connected brain regions in a time-dependent manner
Experiments of human tau viral induction in cortical neurons in young vs old mice showed age-and brain regiondependent misfolding and spreading of tau
Furthermore, in vitro studies showed, that extracellular aggregates of tau can be internalized by naïve cells promoting fibrillization of intracellular tau that can be transferred between co-cultured cells
Tau propagation was extensively studied and different mechanisms involved in trans-cellular diffusion were described.
The prion-like propagation implies an active and regulated passage of tau in the extracellular space (secretion) and a mechanism of tau uptake by an adjacent recipient cell, although the passive release of tau from dying cells cannot be excluded as an alternative scenario.
Tau filaments can exist in the brain as a variety of distinct conformational strains associated with various tauopathy phenotypes and different rates of network propagation
Although the distribution of tau with different conformations can be suggested as cause also of AD heterogeneity, high-resolution analysis of tau structures by using cryo-electron microscopy recently revealed no significant variation in tau filament structures within and between the brains of individuals with AD
Tau can be actively secreted by neurons following three main routes (Figure
First, at the presynaptic level, tau can be packed into microvesicles and further released by a process
Following this route, phosphorylated tau is internalized by cytoplasmic exosomes, so-called intraluminal vesicles formed in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that are finally released into the extracellular space after MVBs fusion with the plasma membrane (PM;
Alternatively, tau can also be internalized in ectosomes, larger vesicles (100-500 nm in diameter) that are formed by evaginations of the PM incorporating tau
These routes are unconventional secretion pathways since they do not involve signal peptides and exclude the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi system.
Extracellular vesicles containing phospho-tau were found in the brains of transgenic mice
Second, the majority of tau is found extracellularly as a membrane-free form.
Soluble hyperphosphorylated tau can translocate directly across the PM
The penetration and release are facilitated by the binding with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the cell surface
Other studies suggested that tau is secreted via the fusion of vesicles from ER or Golgi with the PM
Tau was also shown to form pore-like structures in the PM that operate like channels for the passage of pathogenic proteins, a feature that can be regulated either by pathological mutations, by tau oligomerization
Third, another mechanism that has also been proposed involves the passage through tunneling nanotubes, filamentous actin-containing channels that connect adjacent cells, and transport proteins intercellularly
Once released, tau can be internalized by recipient cells (Figure
Intracranial or peripheral administration of pathological tau
In particular, three kinds of endocytosis were described:
Bulk-endocytosis represents the first one, where a large portion of presynaptic PM is internalized in a dynamindependent manner in form of vacuoles or endosomes from which multiple synaptic vesicles can subsequently be generated
The second, actin-dependent macropinocytosis is mediated by HSPGs on the cell surface
Recently, the silencing of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), which works in conjunction with HSPGs, was shown to block the uptake of tau oligomers in vitro and reduced in vivo the propagation of tau between neurons
Other receptors can also be involved in the uptake of pathogenic tau, such as the extracellular portion of amyloid precursor protein (APP;
Recently, the cellular prion protein was also shown to act as a receptor that facilitates the uptake of tau aggregates by cultured cells
Finally, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was also proposed as mechanism
In general, the different mechanisms of secretion and internalization depend largely on the cell types, the size, and the different tau species involved
Once tau is internalized, it can escape the endosomal vesicles inducing their rupture
Although the biochemical mechanisms driving the conversion of normal tau into the pathological form are still unclear, different models of tau seeding were proposed
Glial cells such as astrocytes
Recently, a study demonstrated that microglia isolated from AD cases and mouse models of tauopathy contain tau seeds that can be released into the medium
The ability of microglia to engulf tau aggregates was already documented by different in vitro and in vivo studies
Moreover, microglia depletion was shown to prevent tau propagation.
Microglia phagocytosed and released tau-containing exosomes whereas inhibiting exosome synthesis significantly reduced tau propagation in vitro and in vivo
Finally, increased microglial activation has been reported not only to accelerate tau pathology and behavioral abnormalities in the human Tau mouse model of tauopathy
Together, these studies highlight the involvement of microglia in spreading tau pathology.

THE SPREAD OF Aβ
Aβ is a proteolytic product of APP, that is highly expressed in neurons and physiologically involved in many functions such as regulation of neurite outgrowth and axonal guidance, regulation of synaptic functions and plasticity, involvement in early nervous system development and in neuroprotection
APP can be processed in two different ways: in the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved first by αfollowed by γ-secretase that cuts the protein within the Aβ domain.
In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is consecutively cut by βand γ-secretase to be finally released extracellularly as Aβ fragments of different lengths, but mainly consist of 40 (Aβ1-40) or 42 (Aβ1-42) amino acids
Once released, monomeric Aβ can aggregate into different assemblies giving origin to oligomers, protofibrils, and amyloid fibrils that are insoluble and can further aggregate into amyloid plaques, while monomeric and oligomeric forms of Aβ are soluble.
These different states of Aβ coexist in the AD brain making it difficult to dissect the most relevant and toxic forms concerning pathogenesis.
Albeit in vivo studies demonstrated that Aβ plaques lead to neuronal loss, neuronal dystrophy and alters their normal neuritic functionality
The fact that the incidence of senile plaques increases with age even in healthy subjects and that the number of plaques often does not correlate with neuronal loss and cognitive decline
Although the ultimate proof for a causal relationship between fibrillar aggregates and neurodegenerative diseases has not been delivered yet, the ''amyloid cascade hypothesis'' is still the most prevalent theory
In addition to their different aggregation state, Aβ was detected in the brain of AD patients in distinct misfolded strains with specific propagation properties
Unlike tau that spreads in a highly predictive pattern as anticipated by computational systems
Nevertheless, amyloid plaques in general first appear in the neocortex from where they spread into the allocortex and the subcortical regions
As has been described above for tau, several studies on intracerebral injections of Aβrich brain extracts either from AD mice or patients propose that Aβ aggregation can be initiated by prion-like seeding
These misfolded protein assemblies act as seeds of aggregation to accelerate the polymerization processes of normal proteins
Aβ peptides are collected in intraluminal vesicles within MVBs and, upon fusion with the PM, the intraluminal vesicles are released into the extracellular space as exosomes
Furthermore, a recent study reported that Aβ-rich exosomes isolated from AD patients can act as vehicles for cell-to-cell transfer of such toxic species in recipient cultured neurons
However, even though the cell-to-cell passage of Aβ represents a plausible hypothesis, substantiated by the fact that the protein is found inside neurons
Transplantations of WT neurons into brains of pre-depositing AD mice revealed that Aβ from the transgenic host tissue can enter and deposit within WT grafts
Although over the last few years many different groups have described glial cells as an alternative source of Aβ
Since Aβ40 and Aβ42 circulate in body fluids such as plasma and CSF
Indeed, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of Aβ-rich extracts in pre-depositing APP23 mice promoted cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA;

PROTEIN CROSS-SEEDING
It is well known that different neuropathological lesions such as Aβ, NFTs, or Lewy bodies can co-exist in the brains of AD patients
Indeed, several studies have shown that the interaction between Aβ and tau can exaggerate AD pathology
Furthermore, oligomeric forms of Aβ were found to be abundant in synapses of AD patients early in the disease before the appearance of phospo-tau at later stages, suggesting that soluble Aβ oligomers in synaptic terminals are associated with dementia onset and may initiate a cascade that drives phosphorylated tau accumulation and its synaptic spread
Nevertheless, the finding that Aβ and tau deposition starts in different brain areas and follows distinct temporal sequences, argues against the idea that tau pathology may be driven exclusively by the presence of amyloid and rather speaks for an Aβ independent pathway
Tau aggregation assays with tau isolated from patients containing both lesions showed an enhanced ability to induce tau aggregates when compared to tau isolated from human cases without plaques
Similar results have been obtained in double-transgenic mice overexpressing both, mutated APP and tau
Furthermore concurrent cortical amyloid deposition in double transgenic mice strongly accelerated interneuronal transfer of tau and boosted its spreading to distal brain regions with an increase in neuronal loss
Intracerebral infusion of Aβ-rich extracts into tau-transgenic mice resulted in significantly more NFT formation compared to tau-rich or WT extracts
Inoculation of human AD-tau extracts into the brains of APP transgenic mice that normally do not form NFTs resulted in rapid fibrillization of endogenous tau
Moreover, ipsi-and contralateral tau propagation was enhanced in tau-injected 5xFAD mice compared to tau-injected WT mice
Transgenic APPPS1+Tau mice, that express WT human tau within a mouse tau-deficient background showed that Aβ and tau can synergistically cooperate to cause a hyperactivity behavioral phenotype and resulted in a downregulation of genes involved in synaptic function
Treatment strategies that aim at reducing tau levels in mice that co-express Aβ and human tau prevented neuronal loss
Together, these results demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of tau reduction with a positive impact on the Aβ-induced cytotoxic effects.
Despite all these observational evidence, the mechanism of Aβ and tau interplay remains largely unknown.
Further studies are necessary to unravel whether it is a direct interaction between the two pathogenic proteins or instead mediated by other factors.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTIVE
Two of the most remarkable features of AD are: (i) the stereotypic pattern of Aβ and tangle spreading through interconnected areas of the brain
These two aspects, together with the fact that the two hallmarks often coexist in the brain of AD patients and amplify each other's toxic effects downstream
Currently, clinical trials targeting Aβ have reported limited success, implying the notion that the timing of intervention is too late and that directing to only one target might be not sufficient to halt the spreading of both pathogenic proteins and to avoid their synergistic impact on neuronal networks.
Furthermore, abundant pieces of evidence have recently highlighted the role that different strains of tau and Aβ may play in modulating the clinical picture of the disease, turning away the possibility to develop therapies against different AD subtypes.
For this purpose, a better understanding of the conformational heterogeneity of tau and Aβ is necessary to better design the best intervention methods.
Although in the last years many molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the formation, aggregation, deposition, and propagation of Aβ and tau were uncovered, many questions remain still open.
Which mechanisms guide Aβ diffusion?
What is the exact sequence of events leading to clinical symptoms?
Which role might other cellular systems or molecular pathways play in promoting the pathological bond of Aβ and tau?
These are only some of the questions that need to be clarified to design the best strategies to finally arrest disease progression.
