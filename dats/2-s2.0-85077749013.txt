Glucocorticoid receptors signaling impairment potentiates amyloid‐β oligomers‐induced pathology in an acute model of Alzheimer’s disease
Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with elevated circulating glucocorticoids (GC) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) signaling impairment.
However, the precise role of GR in the pathophysiology of AD remains unclear.
Using an acute model of AD induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-β oligomers (oAβ), we analyzed cellular and behavioral hallmarks of AD, GR signaling pathways, processing of amyloid precursor protein, and enzymes involved in Tau phosphorylation.
We focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly rich in GR, early altered in AD and involved in HPA axis control and cognitive functions.
We found that oAβ impaired cognitive and emotional behaviors, increased plasma GC levels, synaptic deficits, apoptosis and neuroinflammatory processes.
Moreover, oAβ potentiated the amyloidogenic pathway and enzymes involved both in Tau hyperphosphorylation and GR activation.
Treatment with a selective GR modulator (sGRm) normalized plasma GC levels and all behavioral and biochemical parameters analyzed.
GR seems to occupy a central position in the pathophysiology of AD.

| INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by a progressive impairment of cognitive functions and the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) throughout the brain, including areas particularly involved in memory formation and emotional regulation.
Plaques are composed of insoluble extracellular aggregates consisting mainly of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, while NFT result from hyper-and abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule-stabilizing protein Tau.
Familial forms with known mutations of specific genes represent less than 5% of cases, whereas 95% of patients develop sporadic forms, with unknown mechanisms, but with identified risk factors.
The principal risk factor for sporadic AD is aging.
But, there is also growing evidence that stressful lifetime events may increase the probability of developing AD.
he HPA axis, highly involved in the stress response, triggers the adrenal cortex to release GC.
These steroid hormones readily cross the BBB and bind to low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptors (MR).
GC are necessary for normal cellular activity and fundamental for many CNS functions, including learning and memory.
While MR are localized mainly in the hippocampus, GR are more ubiquitous and are particularly found in several structures of the limbic system (prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampus, and amygdala), which are strongly involved in cognitive and psychological functions but also are important components of the neural circuitry modulating HPA axis activity.
C act synergistically with excitatory amino acids (like glutamate) in neurotoxicity.
Hence, a deregulation of the HPA axis activity or a modification of GR functioning could be extremely toxic, especially in limbic structures,
In chronic animal models of AD (transgenic mice), stress and GC administration affect the course of the pathology.
Chronic stress accelerates the onset of cognitive deficits, triggers amyloid precursor protein (APP) misprocessing, enhances plaque pathology, reduces Aβ clearance, increases Aβ levels, and stimulates Tau hyperphosphorylation and its neuronal accumulation.
In the same line of evidence, a recent study showed that early life stress in APP/PS1 mice induced elevated corticosterone levels, associated with enhanced hippocampal Aβ 1-40/42 and BACE1 levels.
In an acute pathomimetic model of AD obtained after a single intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of an oligomeric solution of Aβ (oAβ 25-35 ),
n the present preclinical study, we focused our attention on the PFC for several reasons.
(a) It is a cerebral region highly involved in the control of the HPA axis.
Indeed, the PFC is involved in both driving the stress-induced activation of the HPA axis, and in mediating negative feedback regulation in times of stress.
(b) The different subdivisions of the PFC are particularly involved in cognitive and emotional processing.
(c) In AD, the PFC is rapidly affected.
(d) GR levels in the PFC are fivefold higher than MR levels,
Thus, on the basis of our previous findings,
CORT113176 is representative of a series of novel, selective non-steroidal GR ligands (1H-pyrazolo(3,4-g)hexahydro-isoquinoline sulfonamides) developed by Corcept Therapeutics (Figure
It exhibits excellent affinity for GR with no measurable affinity for the other nuclear hormone receptors (progesterone, androgen, mineralocorticoid, and estrogen).
5]
These results also reinforce the therapeutic potential of sGRm in AD. in rat hepatocytes.
Hence, we refer to it as a sGRm, with the implication of the advantages linked to selective receptor modulation that we previously reported in detail.
In fact, this family of molecules has the potential to more selectively abrogate pathogenic GR-dependent processes in the brain (as antagonist), while retaining beneficial aspects of GR signaling (as agonist).

| MATERIALS AND METHODS

| Animals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Janvier Lab., Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) weighing 260-280 g (8 weeks), at the beginning of the experiments, were housed 1 week before
experiments in a standard animal facility (12H/12H light/ dark cycle with lights on at 07H00; 21 ± 1°C, food and water ad libitum).
All experiments, including sacrifices, were performed in conscious rats between 09H00 and 14H00, during the diurnal trough of the HPA axis circadian rhythm.

| Ethical considerations
Animal procedures were conducted in strict adherence to the European Union Directive of 2010 (2010/63/EU).
The National French Animal Welfare Committee and the local committee at the University of Montpellier approved all protocols (authorization: CEEA-LR-12160).
All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used, potential pain, suffering, and distress.

| Amyloid-β peptide
In patients, soluble Aβ oligomers contains mainly the sequences Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 . 1 However, they also contain peptides with shorter sequences such as Aβ 25-35 or Aβ 25- 35/40 ,
It can be produced in AD patients by enzymatic cleavage of Aβ 1- 40 .
This Aβ peptide includes extracellular and transmembrane residues that have been reported to represent a biologically active region of Aβ
nterest in this undecapeptide, which itself shows a β-sheet structure,
Aβ 25-35 and scrambled Aβ 25-35 peptides (PolyPeptide, Strasbourg, France) were dissolved in sterile water (1 µg/µL) and stored at -20°C.
Since soluble Aβ oligomers correlate better with the progression of the disease,

| Experimental procedures
To evaluate the impact of oAβ 25-35 (acute model of AD), animals were divided into three groups.
One group had no surgery (control rats), a second received an icv injection of incubated scrambled peptide (10 µg/rat), and a third received an icv injection of oAβ 25-35 (10 µg/rat).
The animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 1 ml of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (80 and 10 mg/ kg b.w., respectively).
oAβ 25-35 was injected directly into the lateral ventricles using a David-Kopf stereotaxic apparatus (Phymep, Paris, France), (coordinates: AP -1 mm, L ±1.5 mm, DV -3.5 mm) (Figure
Based on a previous study

One group has not undergone surgery (control rats, white column), a second group received an icv injection of scrambled Aβ 25-35 peptide (negative control-10 µg/rat-orange column) and a third group received an icv injection of oAβ 25-35 peptide (Aβ-0 µg/rat-red column).
Animals were weighted daily and one week after the icv injection (at Week 1), animals were treated with vehicle or CORT113176 (10 mg/kg per injection) through two intraperitoneal (ip) injections per day during 7 days.
At day 14 (Week 2), the anxious behavior or the spatial short-term memory of each rat were tested in an elevated plus maze (EPM) or in a T-maze, respectively.
The following day (day 15), 30 minutes after the last ip injection, the animals were sacrificed, blood samples and PFC were rapidly collected for corticosterone assay and Western blot analysis, respectively.

Blood samples and the PFC were rapidly collected for corticosterone assay and WB analysis.
Naive rats received no treatment but were manipulated in the same manner as treated rats.
Vehicle rats received only ip injections of sesame oil and served as negative controls for pharmacological treatments.

| Spatial short-term memory
T-maze test was used to rapidly assess the delayed alternation of rats.
This memory behavioral test was used as a non-invasive recurrent readout that we usually perform to make sure we have an appropriate toxicity.
3]
The test involved two trials separated by 1 hour.
During the training session, one short arm (B) was closed.
Rats were placed at the end of the long alley, allowed to visit the maze for 10 minutes and then returned into their home cage.
During the test session, animals were placed in the maze for 2 minutes, with free access to all arms.
The number of visits and time spent in each arm were measured.
The results were expressed as ratio of the time spent in the initially closed novel arm, over the time spent in the previous arm and as a ratio of the number of entries into the novel arm over the familiar one.
The apparatus was cleaned with diluted ethanol (50%) between animals.

| Anxiety behavior
The anxiety state of rats was measured using their ability to explore open and enclosed arms of an EPM, as previously described.
The clear plexiglass apparatus consisted of two open arms (50 × 10 cm) and two enclosed arms (50 × 10 × 45 cm high), extending from a central platform and placed 60 cm above the floor.
Each rat was placed at the center of the plus-maze facing the closed arm and its exploration behavior was recorded for 10 minutes.
The results were expressed as total time spent in the open arms and the total number of entries was counted to verify general motor activity.
An entry into an arm was recorded if the animal crossed the line that connected that arm with the central platform with all four legs.
The apparatus was cleaned with diluted ethanol (50%) between animals.

| Corticosterone assay
Blood samples were collected at the time of sacrifice (day 15), on 1 mg/mL EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), centrifuged at 4°C, and plasma stored at -20°C until assayed for corticosterone.
Plasma corticosterone concentrations were assayed using a conventional ELISA kit (Enzo-Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) in a 10-µL plasma sample diluted (1:40) with the assay buffer.
The assay sensitivity was 27 pg/mL.
The intra-and inter-assay coefficients were 6.6% and 7.8%, respectively.

| Aβ 1-42 assay
Rats were sacrificed by decapitation 15 days after oAβ 25-35 injection and brains were rapidly removed, PFC dissected out, weighted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until assayed.
After thawing, PFC were sonicated (VibraCell; Sonics & Materials, Newtown, CT, USA) for 20 seconds in a lysis buffer.
After centrifugation (14 000 rpm for 25 minutes, 4°C), supernatants were used for Aβ 1-42 ELISA assay (Anaspec, Fremont, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Absorbance was read at 450 nm (Tecan i-control, ThermoFisher Scientific, Illkirch, France) and sample concentration was calculated using the standard curve (Figure
Results were then expressed in pg of Aβ 1-42 /g of tissue.
The assay sensitivity was 3.91 pg/mL.
The intra-and inter-assay coefficients were 4.3% and 6.4%, respectively.

| WB analysis
WB were performed as previously described
All antibodies used are detailed in the Table
Briefly, after sacrifice, the PFC was micro-dissected, weighed, immediately frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C.
Tissues were sonicated (VibraCell; Sonics & Materials, Newtown, CT, USA) in a lysis buffer
Supernatants were collected and the protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Illkirch, France).
In all, 60 µg from each sample was taken for WB analysis.
Samples were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck-Millipore, Dachstein, France).
The membrane was incubated overnight (4°C) with the primary antibody, rinsed and then incubated for 2 hours with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.
Peroxidase activity was revealed using enhanced-chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Luminata-Crescendo, Merck-Millipore).
The intensity of peroxidase activity was quantified using Image-J software (NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA).
β-tubulin (β-Tub) was used as a loading control for all immunoblotting experiments.

| Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM and analyzed using twoway ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison
test (GraphPad-Prism 5.0).
P < .05 was considered significant.
The number of animals in each group is indicated within the columns.
Before each analysis of variance, the Gaussian distribution was evaluated and validated by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (GraphPad-Prism 5.0).

| RESULTS
To characterize the impact of oAβ 25-35 , we previously tested over time (after 1 and 2 weeks) two different doses (5 and 10 µg/rat) on several parameters previously characterized in this acute model of AD
While the scrambled peptide induced no modification in comparison with control naive rats, the dose of 10 µg of oAβ 25-35 was more efficient than the dose of 5 µg.
Indeed, after 10 µg short-term memory deficit (T-maze) was observed up to 2 weeks post-injection (Figure
We next evaluated (in the PFC) the role of GR in the oAβ toxicity using a sGRm (CORT113176).
Animals were treated 1 week after the icv injection of oAβ 25-35 with CORT113176 according to a protocol and a dose established in a previous study.
Control scrambled peptide and vehicle treatment induced no changes in any of the readouts relative to untreated animals (Figures
All blots of control conditions were presented in a supplementary document (Figure
Two weeks after oAβ 25-35 , animals presented anxious behavior (Figure
Treatment with CORT113176 reversed all of these parameters (Figure
Behavioral deficits, observed 2 weeks after oAβ 25-35 , were associated with pre-(SYN) and post-synaptic (PSD95) deficits, increased apoptotic marker expression (Figure
Treatment with the sGRm normalized Caspase 3 expression, the pre-and post-synaptic deficits (Figure
o determine in the PFC the effects of oAβ 25-35 (and of CORT113176) on glucocorticoid receptor signaling, as part of a potential feed-forward or feedback process, animals were treated as previously detailed (Figure
The icv injection of oAβ 25-35 increased the expression of MR and GR (Figure
These effects were associated with an over-activation of GR, as characterized by an increase in the phosphorylated form of GR (Ser 211 ) (Figure
There were opposite changes in the expression of HSP90 and HSP70, the two main chaperones involved in the activity of GR,
5]
Treatment with CORT113176 reversed the increase in GR and MR, decreased the phosphorylation of GR and normalized the HSP90/HSP70 ratio (Figure
The GR phosphorylation status
Indeed, GR can be phosphorylated on several serine and threonine residues.
Thus, we characterized the impact of oAβ 25-35 on GSK-3β and Cdk5, the two main enzymes involved in both the phosphorylation of GR
We first confirmed changed expression ratios of p(Ser9)GSK-3β/ GSK-3β and p(Tyr216)GSK-3β/GSK-3β
Second, we observed increased levels of Cdk5 (Figure
We also measured increased levels of Calpain 1, a member of cysteine proteases family regulated by intracellular calcium and showing aberrant activity in AD.
Lastly, we observed increases in the levels of Fyn (Figure
This family of enzymes is bound to the inactive form of GR as chaperone, and released when GC bind to their receptors.
Under physiological conditions, GC inhibit Fyn activity and phosphorylation,
To summarize, the icv injection of oAβ 25-35 activated both GSK-3β and Cdk5 pathways.
This activation was associated with an increase in p25, Calpain 1, and Fyn levels in the PFC (Figure
Treatment with CORT113176 inhibited the activation of GSK-3β and Cdk5, the maturation of p35 into p25 and the increase in Calpain 1 and Fyn (Figure
In the next part of this study, we characterized the different pathways of APP maturation, through the assessment of the different cellular elements involved in the mutually exclusive processing pathways of APP, the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways (Figures
APP processing and induction of the amyloidogenic pathway (Figure
Two weeks after the injection of oAβ 25-35 , APP levels were increased and amyloidogenic processing was enhanced.
This activation was associated with an increased formation (BACE1 and PS1), and a decreased clearance (IDE).
One week of treatment with CORT113176 inhibited the activation of the amyloidogenic pathway.
The increase in levels of APP, C99, PS1, and BACE1 and also the IDE downregulation were fully reversed (Figure
To characterize the non-amyloidogenic pathway in the PFC, we evaluated by Western blot the levels of the α-secretase-cleaved soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPα) and ADAM10 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase Domain-containing protein 10, a component of α-secretase) (Figure
Two weeks after the injection of oAβ 25-35 , sAPPα and ADAM10 were decreased.
This inhibition of the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP was totally reversed by 1 week of treatment with CORT113176 (Figure
Finally, to confirm the induction of the amyloidogenic pathway, we assayed the endogenous levels of Aβ 1-42 in the PFC (Figure
As expected, 2 weeks after the icv injection of oAβ 25-35 , Aβ 1-42 levels were increased by 18% in the PFC.
This upregulation was totally reversed by the treatment with CORT113176 (Figure
Even if the levels of Aβ 1-42 assayed in the PFC were relatively low, they are consistent with some previous studies in rats.
To understand by which mechanisms non-amyloidogenic pathways could be inhibited, we evaluated the involvement of the Rho-kinases system.
These Ser/Thr kinases are involved in cell motility, cell proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis.
3]
In fact, exacerbated ROCK activity seems to increase the pool of PDK1 molecules physically interacting with and phosphorylated by ROCK.
The overactivation of this system inhibits the non-amyloidogenic pathway
hey seem particularly involved in the inhibition of sAPPα synthesis
Their activity is modulated by GC 72 via GR activation.
To characterize the Rho-kinase system, we measured the PFC levels of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinases (ROCK1 & ROCK2) (Figure
Here, 2 weeks after injection of oAβ 25-35 , we observed in the PFC an increase in ROCK1, ROCK2, and PDK1, which was normalized by 1 week of treatment with the sGRm (Figure

| DISCUSSION
In previous studies, we provided evidence for a vicious cycle between AD and the HPA axis.
We showed that the pathology, and especially the amyloid toxicity, rapidly increases GC secretion that, in turn, modulates APP processing.
This dysregulation seems to be under the control of GR, since treatment with a new class of selective GR ligands blocks the installation of this cycle in the hippocampus and re-establishes all parameters analyzed and disturbed by the amyloid toxicity (memory and synaptic deficits, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, APP processing, and high levels of GC).
Briefly, we determined treatment timing and duration, doses and specificities of the two sGRm (CORT108297 & CORT113167) tested, in comparison to the non-selective antagonist of reference, Mifepristone.
It appeared that 1 week of treatment (two ip injection per day) with CORT113176 (10 mg/kg per injection) displayed the most effective therapeutic potential against toxicity induced by oAβ 25-35 .
Owing to its efficacy and selectivity, this sGRm was selected in the present mechanistic study.
Here, on the basis of our precedent finding,
For this purpose, we evaluated the impact of oAβ 25-35 on several intracellular pathways involved in the activation of GR but also in the pathophysiology of AD.
We show the establishment of several intracellular vicious cycles involving GC and GR, providing mechanistic insight to a central role of these receptors in the etiology of AD (Figure
The notion of a vicious cycle between GC signaling and pathogenesis is reinforced by the fact that modulation of GR activity with CORT113176 normalized all changes induced by the amyloid toxicity.
In the first part of our study, to validate our protocols in comparison with the previous study,
In addition, and for the first time, we show that treatment with sGRm is able to reverse anxious behavior induced by the amyloid toxicity.
We equally demonstrate that sGRm treatment is able to reverse synaptic deficits, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis processes induced by oAβ 25-35 in the PFC, as previously observed in the hippocampus.
hen, we showed that the icv injection of oAβ 25-35 increased GR phosphorylation on Ser 211 , a site involved in the activation of GR in rats.
This activation was associated with an increase and activation of GSK-3β and Cdk5, with a substantial increase in the HSP90/HSP70 ratio (important for GR activity
5]
The effects in the PFC of CORT113176 on the activation of GSK-3β and Cdk5 pathways induced by the icv injection of oAβ 25-35 were evaluated by Western blot.
The activation of GSK-3β (ratio of p[Tyr216]GSK-3β/GSK-3β total & ratio of p[Ser9]GSK-3β/GSK-3β total, 46kDa each) (A-C) and Cdk5 (30 kDa) (A,D) pathways, the expression ratio of p25/p35 (25 & 35 kDa) (A,E), Calpain 1 (80 kDa) (A,F) and FYN (59 kDa) (A,G) were evaluated in control (C-white column) and in icv injected rats with 10 µg/rat of scrambled peptide (S-orange column) or oAβ 25-35 (Aβ-red column), treated or not with vehicle (sesame oil) or the selective GR modulator CORT113176 (10 mg/kg per ip injection).
For experimental protocol, see Figure
The variations of all proteins in the PFC were normalized with the variations of β-tubulin (β-tub, 50 kDa) and compared with non-injected rats (control group: C).
Two-way ANOVA: p[Tyr216]GSK-3β/GSK-3β: F 2,51 = 17.0 for group, P < .0001;

increased in AD patients.
Our data show that the overactivation of GR induced by oAβ 25-35 coincided with an increase in these two enzymes (Figure
We also observed that oAβ 25-35 induced a strong increase in Calpain 1.
This augmentation could be the reflection of its proteolytic activity, given that it was concomitant with an activation of two of its substrates, GSK-3β and an increase in p25/p35 ratio.
These effects were reversed by treatment with the sGRm (CORT113176), providing evidence of an intracellular loop by which pathology increases the activation of GR
(directly via GSK-3β and Cdk5 and indirectly via Fyn and Calpain 1), which in turn increases the activation of these key enzymes and the HSP90/HSP70 ratio, worsening the AD pathogenesis
Our current data show that the seeding and the accumulation of endogenous Aβ induced by the icv injection of oAβ 25-35
Indeed, the icv injection of oAβ 25-  35 provoked the activation of the amyloidogenic pathway in the PFC, through an increase in Aβ synthesis (APP/C99, Aβ 1-42 , BACE1, and PS1 upregulation) and a decrease in Aβ clearance (IDE downregulation), as previously reported for the hippocampus.
Besides, Aβ oligomers also inhibit the non-amyloidogenic pathway (sAPPα and ADAM 10 downregulation) and that this effect could be controlled by the activation of ROCK1 and ROCK2 (Figure
We showed that the oAβ 25-35 injection-induced inhibition of sAPPα and ADAM10 is associated with an activation of ROCK/PDK1 pathways.
These results are consistent with several studies showing that ROCKs modulate the shedding of sAPPα through an inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM) activity, and that ROCKs depletion reduces Aβ levels.
ROCK activity seems to be directly upregulated by GC,
ROCK also affect Tau hyperphosphorylation.
In addition, ROCK/PDK1 inhibition of sAPPα may affect Tau, since it was shown that sAPPα reduces GSK-3β-mediated Tau phosphorylation.
hese two mechanisms again link GR and GC to the pathophysiology of AD (Figure
Likewise, Tau phosphorylation may also be directly impacted by the other GR-related enzymes we described.
Indeed, Fyn can directly phosphorylate Tau on tyrosine residues.
Fyn can also directly activate GSK-3β to rapidly induce Tau phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma cells.
In the same line of evidence, it appears that Fyn controls the activity of PDK1 through an upregulation of ROCK,
Calpain 1 also activates GSK-3β and Cdk5, promoting Tau phosphorylation and Tau-associated neurodegeneration.
Calpain 1 can cleave the neuron-specific Cdk5 activator p35 to produce p25, which accumulates in the brains of AD patients.
In fact, it was shown that induction of p25 by Calpain 1 causes prolonged activation and mislocalization of Cdk5 and that the p25/Cdk5 kinase hyperphosphorylates Tau, disrupts the cytoskeleton and promotes the apoptotic death of primary cortical neurons.
Thus, Fyn and Calpain 1 upregulations may be involved in both the increased Tau phosphorylation after oAβ 25-35 injection,
This highlights the potential link that GR activation could play between Aβ and Tau (Figure
The mechanisms by which GR affects the multiple enzymes identified here is unclear.
GR are nuclear receptors that directly interact with specific genes via binding to glucocorticoid response element (GRE), interactions with other transcription factors, or via non-genomic mechanisms, such as epigenetic modifications.
A GRE has been described in the promoter regions of APP and BACE1.
5]
A recent study on hippocampal slices pre-treated with an inhibitor of transcription activity showed a non-genomic activation of GSK-3β by GC.
Of note, involvement of membrane-localized GR was linked to AD not only for the regulation of GSK-3β 88 but also-surprisingly-in the regulation of BACE1.
For the other proteins, further investigations will be needed to decipher which mechanisms are involved in GR regulatory activity.
There is also the potential for more indirect mechanisms, since membrane-localized GR can facilitate glutamatergic transmission,
This new study provides new arguments supporting the development of a vicious cycle based on GR activation in AD, here based on analysis of changes in the PFC.
In this preclinical study, the new sGRm (CORT113176) blocked this cycle and normalized all AD processes analyzed, including extracellular (ADAM10, BACE1 and IDE),
Aβ oligomers induce, in addition to an excess of circulating GC, an overactivation of GR, which is associated with an increase in the two main chaperones (HSP90 & HSP70) particularly involved in the activity of GR
5]
Therefore, it evidences a first intracellular vicious cycle by which pathology increases circulating GC, which, in turn, increase pathology.
Aβ oligomers also enhance contents and activity of key enzymes involved directly (Cdk5 and GSK-3β) or indirectly (Calpain 1 and Fyn) in the activation of GR but also in the hyperphosphorylation of Tau.
Enzyme inductions which are regulated by GR, as evidenced after treatment with the selective GR modulator (CORT113176), demonstrate non-genomic effects of GR and thus a second intracellular vicious cycle.
Indeed, pathology increases the activation of GR via several keys enzymes (Cdk5, GSK-3β, Calpain 1, and Fyn), which, in turn, increase the activation of these enzymes involved in the pathophysiology of AD.
Finally, it appears that amyloid toxicity inhibits also the non-amyloidogenic pathways, reinforcing the displacement of the equilibrium in favor of endogenous amyloid seeding and evidencing another intracellular loop by which pathology increases the activation of GR, which, in turn, increases the activation of ROCKs/PDK1 pathways, as evidenced after treatment with the selective GR modulator (CORT113176).
This activation accentuates the pathology through the inhibition of α-secretase (ADAM10) and sAPPα synthesis, as previously reported

In addition, we cannot exclude, as previously mentioned in the hippocampus,
Indeed, several studies suggested a neuroprotective role of these receptors in a context of GR blockade.

We moreover demonstrated that the accumulation of endogenous Aβ, induced by the amyloid toxicity and the concomitant dysregulation of HPA axis, resulted from the activation of amyloidogenic and the inhibition of the non-amyloidogenic pathways (Figure
All of these data place HPA axis dysregulation and GR in a central and crucial position in the pathophysiology of AD, linking amyloid toxicity and Tau deregulation.
This work also highlights the therapeutic potential of sGRm to counteract negative effects induced by the amyloid toxicity and to re-establish the functionality of GR and a fortiori to re-establish the primal role of GC in the maintenance of homeostasis.
