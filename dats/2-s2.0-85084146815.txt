Biological sex and DNA repair deficiency drive Alzheimer’s disease via systemic metabolic remodeling and brain mitochondrial dysfunction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that is more prevalent in women.
The increased risk of AD in women is not well understood.
It is well established that there are sex differences in metabolism and that metabolic alterations are an early component of AD.
We utilized a cross-species approach to evaluate conserved metabolic alterations in the serum and brain of human AD subjects, two AD mouse models, a human cell line, and two Caenorhabditis elegans AD strains.
We found a mitochondrial complex I-specific impairment in cortical synaptic brain mitochondria in female, but not male, AD mice.
In the hippocampus, Polβ haploinsufficiency caused synaptic complex I impairment in male and female mice, demonstrating the critical role of DNA repair in mitochondrial function.
In non-synaptic, glial-enriched, mitochondria from the cortex and hippocampus, complex II-dependent respiration increased in female, but not male, AD mice.
These results suggested a glial upregulation of fatty acid metabolism to compensate for neuronal glucose hypometabolism in AD.
Using an unbiased metabolomics approach, we consistently observed evidence of systemic and brain metabolic remodeling with a shift from glucose to lipid metabolism in humans with AD, and in AD mice.
We determined that this metabolic shift is necessary for cellular and organismal survival in C. elegans, and human cell culture AD models.
We observed sex-specific, systemic, and brain metabolic alterations in humans with AD, and that these metabolite changes significantly correlate

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disease and there are no efficacious treatments.
Two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with AD are women
Independent of differences in longevity, there are likely to be sex differences in risk factors, pathogenesis, and underlying disease mechanisms
For example, prior studies have indicated that female AD patients have a higher burden of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
However, the metabolic mechanisms and implicated cellular pathways that may be associated with increased AD risk in females are unknown.
It has been known for decades that systemic metabolism differs between men and women
For example, during endurance exercise tests in a clinical laboratory setting, male study participants derived 97% of energy for exercise from carbohydrates (glucose) and proteins (amino acids) while females derived 62% of energy for exercise from fat
Brain glucose hypometabolism precedes cognitive impairment and has been demonstrated in human AD patients by positron emission topography (PET) neuroimaging and metabolomic approaches by several laboratories
These reports suggest that intrinsic sex differences in metabolism may contribute to the higher prevalence of AD among women.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central hallmark of nearly all neurodegenerative diseases including AD
Despite this consensus, the mitochondrial mechanisms implicated in AD remain unclear.
Several reports have suggested different sites along the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) as the site of dysfunction.
However, these reports are inconsistent, with some studies reporting complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) dysfunction
One report from a laboratory with mitochondrial expertise reported no consistent mitochondrial bioenergetic impairment in three different transgenic mouse models of AD
As mitochondrial function is known to differ between males and females
We further investigated conserved metabolic mechanisms of AD using a cross-species approach in humans, mice, C. elegans, and human cells.
The Bohr lab has previously shown that human AD patients have a decrease in the essential base excision repair (BER) DNA polymerase beta (Polβ)
These data suggest that Polβ has important mitochondrial functions in the brain that may contribute to AD pathophysiology.
To evaluate the role of Polβ deficiency in brain mitochondrial function and AD, we utilized a DNA repair deficient (Polβ heterozygous) mouse and crossed it with the well-characterized 3×Tg model of AD (3×β)
Importantly, these mice have neuronal cell death and recapitulate the mitochondrial transcriptional changes observed in human AD
In this study, we utilized four genotypes: wild-type (WT), Polβ ±, 3×, and 3×β mice to determine the putative contribution of Polβ deficiency to mitochondrial health in AD.
The sites of mitochondrial ETC inhibition in cortical and hippocampal synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria were evaluated to test the hypothesis that Polβ deficiency contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, and that the underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to increased female risk in AD.
Herein, we report sex-dependent mitochondrial and metabolic mechanisms in murine AD models that may explain differences in risk for AD in women.
We identify a female-specific mitochondrial complex I impairment in cortical synaptosomes and a metabolic switch from glucose to fatty acid metabolism in non-synaptic mitochondria and systemically, in plasma, which is more pronounced in female compared to male AD mice.
To assess the role and conservation of this metabolic switch in AD across species we utilized human cell culture and C. elegans models of AD that indicate the switch to fatty acid metabolism is a compensatory neuroprotective metabolic mechanism in AD.
Furthermore, we observe striking similarities in patterns of metabolic remodeling in mice and humans with AD that provide insight into mechanisms underlying glucose hypometabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.
Overall, these data suggest significant sex differences in mitochondrial mechanisms and metabolic responses to AD, which may explain AD risk and differing disease pathways in females compared to males.
Furthermore, we identify specific sites of metabolic impairment within glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in mice and humans that likely contribute to glucose hypometabolism and oxidative stress in AD and represent targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions.

Materials and methods

Mice
Age-matched (18-month old) male and female adult mice were used in all experiments with littermate controls used when possible.
Mice were maintained on a standard NIH diet ad libitum in a 12-h light/dark cycle.
All mice were housed in the National Institute on Aging (NIA), Baltimore.
The animals were group housed where possible.
All animal experiments were performed using protocols approved by the appropriate institutional animal care and use committee of the NIA.
The original AD line was generated as described previously

C. elegans
Standard C. elegans strain maintenance procedures were followed.
Nematodes were maintained at 15 °C on normal growth media (NGM) and OP50 bacteria.
C. elegans were synchronized via egg lay at 20 °C.
The following strains were used in this study.
N2: wildtype, CL2355: Pan-neuronal expression of human amyloid β peptide; dvIs50 [P snb-1 Abeta 1-42; P mtl-2 GFP] I, BR5270: Pan-neuronal overexpression of the F3 pro aggregation fragment of the human Tau protein with K280 deleted (line A); byIs161[p rab-3 F3ΔK280; p myo-2 mCherry], and BR5271: an-neuronal overexpression of the F3 pro aggregation fragment of the human Tau protein with K280 deleted and two isoleucines to proline substitutions in the hexapeptide motifs of the repeat region (line A), which abrogate tau aggregation; byIs162 [rab-3p:F3ΔK280 I277P I380P + myo-2p::mCherry].
L4-stage synchronized nematodes were placed on NGM plates containing 100 μM etomoxir or equal volumes of DMSO (vehicle control).
All strains were maintained at 20 °C for survival experiments with the exception of CL2355, which were cultured at 25 °C due to the temperature-sensitive regulation of amyloid expression.
Viability was determined 6 days following drug treatment and percent survival was calculated.
Worms unresponsive to a light touch with a platinum wire were considered dead.
Experiments were performed in triplicate (3 plates of n = 20 nematodes/plate) and were repeated in at least two independent experiments.

Cell culture
Human H4 neuroglioma cells expressing wild-type or the M146V mutated Presenelin-1 (PS1) protein under a doxycycline-dependent promotor were cultured as described
Cells were cultured in DMEM with Zeocin and Blasticidin.
PS1 expression was induced via the addition of doxycycline (1 μg/mL) for 72 h before the addition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) inhibitor etomoxir (40 μM) for 8 h prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS solution and immunofluorescence staining for cleaved caspase-3 (Novusbio MAB835, 2.5 μg/mL).
Z-stack images were acquired on Confocal images (zseries) were captured with Zeiss LSM 880 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using a 40 × /1.3 Plan-NeoFluar oil-immersion objective at 1 μm z-step intervals with lateral pixel dimensions of 0.22 μm.
Captured z-series were imported and analyzed using FIJI-ImageJ.
Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM pyruvate.
3-5 175 cm 2 cell culture plates of U2OS cells were utilized for mitochondrial isolation for glucose-6-phosphate induced hexokinase dissociation experiments.
10-20 μg of mitochondria were incubated in MAS buffer with pyruvate (5 mM) and malate (2.5 mM) with the indicated dose of glucose-6-phosphate (0-500 mM) for 30 min at 37 °C before centrifugation of mitochondria at 17,000×g.
Supernatant was aspirated and the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 1 × Laemelli buffer containing βmercaptoethanol for western blot analysis.

Mitochondrial isolation
Brain tissues were rapidly collected and rinsed in ice cold mitochondrial isolation buffer (MS: 225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.4 with KOH at 4 °C).
Cortex and hippocampus were homogenized in 10 mL of MS buffer manually using ten strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem teflon tissue grinder pestle in a 15 ml Dounce Homogenizer (VWR).
Resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 2200×g for 3 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant was removed and kept on ice and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml MS and centrifuged at 2200×g.
Resulting supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 22,000×g for 10 min.
The pellet, containing primarily free (non-synaptic) mitochondria plus synaptosomes, was then resuspended in 3.5 mL of MS buffer containing 15% Percoll ® .
Synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria were separated via centrifugation through a 24-40% Percoll ® gradient as described
Synaptosomes were permeabilized to permit substrate influx via a 3 min incubation with 0.001% digitonin (Calbiochem).
Non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria were washed with 10 mL of fresh MS buffer and pelleted at 22,000×g for 10 min.
This pellet was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 17,000×g for 10 min.
This final pellet was resuspended in 50-100 μl of MS buffer without EGTA and protein content measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher).

Mitochondrial respirometry
Mitochondrial respiration was measured on a 96XFe Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer adapted from previously reported methods
Mitochondria were suspended in respiration buffer (MAS: 70 mM sucrose, 220 mM mannitol, 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA and 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.2 at 37 °C) and plated in 96-well Seahorse plates before centrifugation at 2200×g for 10 min at 4 °C.
5 μg of mitochondria were plated in triplicate for complex I (pyruvate 10 mM, malate 2.5 mM)-and complex II (10 mM succinate, 2 μM rotenone)-dependent coupling experiments followed by injections of (A) ADP (5 mM), (B) oligomycin (2.5 μM), (C) FCCP (4 μM), (D) Antimycin A (2 μM) + rotenone (1 μM).
2.5 μg of mitochondria per well were plated in triplicate for maximal electron flow experiments (10 mM pyruvate, 2.5 mM malate, 4 μM FCCP) measurements followed by injections of (A) rotenone (2 μM), (B) Succinate (10 mM), (C) Antimycin A (2 μM), (D) TMPD (100 μM) + Ascorbate (10 mM).
The mean of triplicates from each experiment was used to quantify each respiratory state.
Experiments with negative oxygen consumption values or wells where mitochondria detached form the plate were excluded from analysis.
Respiratory control ratios were calculated as state 3 (ADP simulated) divided by state 4 (oligomycin) respiration.
Mix-wait-measure protocols have been previously described
Remaining mitochondrial samples were treated with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell signaling) and stored at -80 °C for further analysis.

n = 4-6 mice/group.

Cardiac perfusion and brain slice preparation
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to transcardial perfusion with heparinized PBS (1U heparin/mL PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.
Brains were cryostat sectioned at 20 μM thickness on a cryostat (Leica) in a 1:12 series and stored in cryoprotectant solution (66 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 190 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 870 mM sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, and 1.25 mM povidone) at -20 °C.
6 serial brain Sections (240 microns apart) representing the entire brain were mounted on Superfrost ® slides (Fisher Scientific).

Oil Red O staining for lipid droplets
Following a 5-min equilibration in 60% isopropanol, tissue was exposed to Oil Red O (Sigma) working solution (30 ml:20 ml of Oil Red O Stain, Isopropanol in distilled water) for 1 h at room temperature.
The sections were washed three times in 60% isopropanol for one minute and cover-slipped with mounting media containing DAPI (ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI, Life technologies).
Images of CA3 hippocampi were captured in at least 2 sections containing the CA3 region of the hippocampus under brightfield at 20 × magnification on a Zeiss Axioimager M2 microscope.
Lipid droplets were calculated for each image in Image J software using the particle analysis tool with the following thresholds (color: 60-255, Saturation:100-255, brightness: 0-229).
Lipid droplet counts from each brain section were calculated and averaged per animal (n = 4 animals/group).

Thioflavin-S staining for amyloid beta
Amyloid beta plaques were detected by Thioflavin-S staining.
Slides were first permeabilized in PBS + 0.1% Triton then given a 1-min equilibration in 75% isopropanol.
Tissue was then exposed to a modified version of thioflavin-S staining technique.
Traditional thioflavin-S staining was previously modified by
And a post-treatment step in 3xPBS for 30 min at 4 °C was added to alleviate photobleaching.
In our preliminary optimization trials, we tested dilutions of 0.05%, 0.025%, and 0.0125% Thioflavin-S to minimize autofluorescence.
To manage nonspecific lipofuscin autofluorescence, we added a TrueBlack ® (Biotium, VWR) blocking step.
We found that using 0.0125% Thioflavin-S and exposing tissue for 3 min to TrueBlack ® was the most optimal procedure and was used for the remainder of the study.
The mounted slides were treated with 0.25% KMnO 4 potassium permanganate for 4 min on a shaker.
Slides are then washed with distilled water followed by treatment in 1% sodium borohydride for 5 min on the rocker and washed again with distilled water.
Slides are then stained with 0.0125% thioflavin-S in 50% ethanol in the dark for 8 min.
This step was followed by differentiation in two changes of 80% ethanol for 10 s each and three washes in large volumes of distilled water.
Slides were then incubated in 3 × PBS at 4C for 30 min, then briefly rinsed with distilled water and cover slipped with mounting media containing DAPI (ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI, Life technologies).
Images of subiculum subregions were captured using Zeiss Axiomager M2 Microscope at 10 × magnification under autofluorescence setting.
Amyloid beta plaques were calculated for each image in Image J software using the particle analysis tool with the following thresholds (color: 0-85, Saturation: 229-225, brightness: 50-255).
To avoid non-specific particle detection, particle measurements was set to size 50-infinity and circumference of 0-1.
Amyloid beta counts from each brain section were calculated and averaged per animal (n = 4 animals/group).

Briefly, the case-control study included participants who converted to AD (converters) and matched participants who remained cognitively normal (non-converters).
The baseline visit was defined as approximately 5 years prior to age of onset of AD clinical symptoms for converters and matched visits for non-converters.
Both converters and non-converters were cognitively normal at baseline.
The follow-up visit was defined as at the age of onset of clinical symptoms for converters and matched visits for nonconverters.

The autopsy program of the BLSA was initiated in 1986 and has been described previously
Postmortem brains were examined by an expert neuropathologist to assess AD pathology.
As described previously, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and Braak criteria were used to assess severity of AD pathology based on neuritic plaques
Participants indicated as AD had clinical symptoms of AD (i.e., cognitive impairment) during life (see below for description of how cognitive status was determined) and AD pathology at autopsy.
Participants indicated as Control (CON) had no clinical symptoms during life and no AD pathology at autopsy.
For analyses exploring associations with pathology, we additionally included the asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease group (ASY) that has been described in detail previously.
Participants indicated as ASY had no clinical symptoms of AD during life however had AD pathology at autopsy.
The brain region selected a priori for this study was from the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), sampled to represent a brain region vulnerable to early pathology accumulation.
A sterile 4-mm-diameter tissue punch was extracted from the cortical surface of the brain tissue regions, which were stored at -80 °C.
Determining cognitive status-Procedures for determining cognitive status in the BLSA have been described in detail previously
Briefly, cognitive status was considered at consensus diagnosis conferences after each evaluation where participants underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests.
Longitudinal participant data reviewed during case conference included cognitive assessments, medication history, self-reported diagnoses of comorbid medical conditions, neuroimaging data, and laboratory evaluation for reversible causes of cognitive impairment (e.g., serum TSH and B12 levels).
Dementia diagnosis was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-III-R criteria
AD diagnosis was based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria
Metabolomic profiling-Quantitative and targeted metabolomics assays were performed on blood and brain tissue samples using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF MS) by Human Metabolome Technologies (HMT), Inc., Tsuruoka, Japan and flow injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry by Biocrates.

For the remaining metabolites, all missing values were imputed as LOD/2.
For blood metabolites specifically, all values were then natural log transformed, and outlier values outside 1.5 times the interquartile range (1.5 × IR) were excluded.
For blood analyses within the case-control study, we explored whether blood metabolite concentration discriminated between converters and non-converters using logistic regression models controlling for sex (in total sample only), age and race at baseline and follow-up visits.
Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values were reported for all models.
For brain analyses, similar to prior studies

CERAD and Braak scores) using spearman rank correlation tests.
Participants included AD, CON and ASY groups.
P values were reported for all models.
Stata 13.0 was used for all analyses and visualizations.

Results

Cortical synaptic mitochondrial complex I impairment in female AD mice
Surprisingly, male cortical synaptosomes showed no change in mitochondrial complex I (CI) function, but an increase in mitochondrial complex IV function in 3× and 3×β AD mice compared to WT mice (Fig.
Conversely, we observed that CI function is significantly decreased in cortical synaptic mitochondria from female 3 × and 3×β synaptic mitochondria compared to WT mice (Fig.
Concomitant with the downregulation of CI function in cortical synaptosomes from females, we observed that non-synaptic (astrocyteenriched) complex II (CII) mitochondrial function is increased compared to female WT mice (Fig.
Interestingly, we did not find any difference in cortical non-synaptic mitochondrial respiration from male mice (Fig.
Notably, female wild-type mice have higher rates of respiration for nearly all respiratory parameters measured (Fig.
This may be due to a significant elevation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, PGC1α, in female mouse cortex compared to males, independent of genotype (p = 0.026, supplemental Fig.
Notably, PGC1α has been demonstrated to decline as a function of dementia in human AD subjects
Taken together, these data indicate a female susceptibility to neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and suggests an augmentation of fatty acid metabolism in astrocytes via the donation of reducing equivalents through succinyl-CoA, thus fueling succinate dehydrogenase (CII) for cerebral energy production.
These findings are consistent with astrocytes playing the primary role in fatty acid and ketone metabolism in the brain
We then evaluated protein abundance of representative ETC subunits and BH3-only proteins involved in cell death pathways (Fig.
Consistent with mitochondrial respiratory deficits, we found significant decreases in representative complex I subunit NDUFB8 expression in female, but not male, cortical synaptosomes from 3 × and 3×β AD mice (Fig.
In fact, we observe a significant decrease in UQCRC2 and cytochrome oxidase subunit MTCO1 in female, but increased protein abundance in male, 3 × AD mice (Fig.
In cortical synaptosomes from 3×β AD mice, we found a decreased of UQCRC2 and complex V subunit ATP5A in both male and female mice (Fig.
Together, these results indicate that female AD mice are uniquely susceptible to cortical mitochondrial complex I dysfunction, and that male AD mice increase cytochrome oxidase activity and the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrially encoded ETC subunits to compensate for metabolic perturbations in AD.
Since the bioenergetic impairments in the female cortical synaptosomes may relate to the previously reported increased rate of cortical neurodegeneration observed in human female AD subjects
We observed a significant increase in BAX/BCL2 ratio in female, but not male cortical synaptosomes (Fig.
Additionally, we find a significant increase in apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) in 3 × and 3×β cortical synaptosomes (Fig.
AIF is best recognized for its role in cell death.
However, it also plays substantial roles in redox homeostasis and can promote electron transport to coenzyme Q
Therefore, increased AIF abundance may reflect a physiological adaptive mechanism to bypass complex I impairment in AD.
Together these data suggest differing mechanisms of mitochondrial metabolic alterations and cell death signaling pathways that could contribute to the higher rates of cortical atrophy observed in women with AD

Polβ deficiency causes mitochondrial complex I impairment in hippocampal synaptosomes
The hippocampus is a critical structure for learning and memory that progressively degenerates in both male and female AD subjects
DNA base excision repair (BER) capacity decreases in AD
We therefore sought to determine the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction and the role of BER deficiency in the hippocampus of AD mice.
Synaptosomes isolated from the hippocampus displayed a CI-dependent respiratory impairment in both male (Fig.
These results demonstrate the surprising result that the 3× AD mice lack hippocampal synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction and provide evidence for a critical role of DNA POLβ in hippocampal neuronal metabolism.
The lack of sex differences in hippocampal synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction is consistent with neurodegeneration of the hippocampus as a universal hallmark of AD in men and women
Similar to the cortex, we observe no differences among genotypes in male non-synaptic mitochondria from the hippocampus (Fig.
We also observe a significant decrease in complex IV-dependent respiration in hippocampal non-synaptic mitochondria from female 3×β mice (Fig.
We further evaluated ETC protein expression in hippocampal synaptosomes (Fig.
Consistent with complex I-mediated impairment in mitochondrial function, we observed a significant decrease in NDUFB8 expression in POLβ and 3×β hippocampal synaptosomes from female mice (Fig.
Interestingly, despite the same functional deficit observed in both male and female mice, we did not observe altered NDUFB8 levels in male hippocampal synaptosomes (Fig.
The SDHB subunit of complex II was downregulated in male POLβ, 3×, and 3×β mice, while in females, it was decreased in 3 × and 3×β mice (Fig.
Complex III ETC subunit UQCRC2 was decreased in female POLβ, 3×, and 3×β female hippocampal synaptosomes, and unchanged in males, resulting in significantly higher levels of UQCRC2 in male POLβ and 3×β hippocampal synaptosomes compared to females (Fig.
Similarly, we found that female WT mice have significantly higher CIV subunit MTCO1 than WT male mice (Fig.
ATP synthase (CV) subunit ATP5A also demonstrated sex-dependent alterations in 3×β mice, with a decreased abundance only observed in female 3×β mice (Fig.
These results further suggest sex-dependent mitochondrial adaptations to AD pathology.
Similar to our observations in the cortex, the deficit in CI-mediated respiration in synaptic mitochondria concomitant with an increase in CII-mediated respiration in non-synaptic mitochondria suggests a switch to fatty-acid or ketone metabolism in astrocytes to provide metabolic support to neighboring neurons that cannot efficiently metabolize glucose.
We sought to further investigate this possibility, while also determining if this metabolic switch was restricted to the brain, or whether it was reflective of systemic metabolic impairments in AD as has been postulated

Upregulation of systemic fatty acid metabolism in AD mice
To investigate whether biological sex impacts systemic metabolism and further understand mechanisms of systemic metabolic remodeling in AD, we performed an unbiased gas chromatography time-of-flight (GC-TOF) metabolomics analysis of plasma from AD mice.
Phenotypically, we observed that the males are significantly fatter than females in the 3 × and 3×β AD mice (Fig.
This evidence suggests that metabolic dysregulation is a central feature of AD and that intrinsic metabolic differences between men and women may contribute to the increased risk of AD in females.
Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated a significant separation between male and female AD mice (Fig.
Furthermore, results confirmed an upregulation of fatty acids and the principal ketone body 3OH-butyrate, which was more pronounced in female than male AD mice (Fig.
Moreover, we found a marked accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates citrate, isocitrate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate indicating a lack of flux through isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
Consistent with a deficit in glucose metabolism, the accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) has been reported to impair the enzyme activity of hexokinase
Furthermore, G6P is the rate-limiting substrate of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that is critical for the generation of NADPH and the subsequent detoxification of damaging free oxygen radicals
Metabolite set enrichment (MSE) pathway analysis indicated that affected metabolic pathways include: alpha linolenic and linoleic acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, betaine metabolism, spermidine and spermine biosynthesis, nucleotide sugars metabolism, phospholipid biosynthesis, threonine and 2-oxobutanoate degradation, inositol metabolism, ketone body metabolism, catecholamine biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, purine metabolism, PPP, TCA cycle, and the mitochondrial ETC (Fig.
The summary of metabolite pathway alterations is depicted in Fig.
These results demonstrate that a systemic shift from glycolysis to lipid metabolism is evident in AD mice and that distinct sites of glycolytic, TCA cycle, and PPP inhibition likely play a role in the metabolic alterations implicated in AD etiology.

Upregulation of lipolysis and ketolysis enzymes in the cortex of AD mice
To investigate whether fatty acid metabolism and ketone utilization (ketolysis) are also increased in the brain of AD mice, we evaluated brain lipid droplet abundance by Oil Red O staining (Fig.
Consistent with the increased CII-mediated respiration (Fig.
Lipid oxidation requires several steps to liberate free fatty acids from lipid stores, import fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation, and the formation of ketone bodies for acetyl-CoA and ATP synthesis.
We, therefore, investigated the protein levels of enzymes critically involved in these pathways in the cortex of AD mice (Fig.
We have previously observed a marked increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression throughout the brain of 3×β mice utilizing a spatial transcriptomics approach (Bohr lab, unpublished observations).
Indeed, we observed increased protein levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (Fig.
CPT-1 is critical for the import of fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation
Studies on CPT-1 activity in human AD patients are limited, and have thus far not found significant differences in activity
However, we have observed previously that fatty acid metabolism is altered in postmortem human AD brain
Peroxisomes are also known to coordinate beta oxidation of fatty acids
We determined that peroxisomal fatty acid transport protein ABCD3/PMP70
Moreover, increased expression of downstream ketolysis enzymatic machinery succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) (Fig.

Increased fatty acid metabolism is a beneficial compensatory response
To determine if the augmentation of lipid metabolism pathways observed in the plasma and brain of AD mice is a detrimental or beneficial metabolic response, we utilized human H4 neuroglioma cells expressing wild-type (PS1 WT ) and the human AD-linked presenilin mutation (PS1 M146V ) and C. elegans strains expressing neuronal human amyloid beta or tau.
To test the importance of fatty acid metabolism in these systems, we treated these cells/ nematodes with etomoxir (40 μM/100 μM, respectively), a CPT-1 inhibitor, that inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid transport and, therefore, β-oxidation
We determined that PS1 M146V cells activated caspase-3-dependent cell death pathways following CPT-1 inhibition, whereas PS1 WT expressing cells did not display an increase in active caspase-3 in response to etomoxir treatment (Fig.
These data indicate that the augmentation of fatty acid metabolism observed in AD is an adaptive metabolic switch to maintain adequate energy production necessary for cell survival.
To investigate the cross-species conservation of the metabolic switch to fatty acid oxidation in vivo, we utilized C. elegans AD strains treated with etomoxir and assayed nematode viability.
We found that AD strains expressing neuronal amyloid beta (CL2355) or tau (BR5270) had a significant decrease in viability following etomoxir treatment (Fig.
These results further support the concept that the increased fatty acid metabolism observed in AD is a compensatory physiologic adaptation to maintain adequate cellular energy production and prevent neurodegeneration.
Encouraged by the conservation of metabolic mechanisms in mice, C. elegans and human cell culture AD models, and the possible relevance to patterns of neurodegeneration in humans with AD, we sought to investigate if similar metabolic alterations are also evident in serum and brain tissue of AD patients.

Sex-dependent systemic metabolic alterations in preclinical and clinical AD serum
The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a prospective cohort study of community dwelling participants that began in 1958
Detailed clinical and cognitive evaluations, including laboratory, radiological, and neurological evaluations were conducted every two years, and for participants older than 80 years, every year.
A subset of the overall BLSA study included a case-control cohort
preclinical AD stage) and follow-up (clinical AD stage).
We tested whether the metabolite alterations observed in AD mouse models were also altered in human serum within this case-control cohort of AD (n = 107, male n = 48, female n = 59, supplemental Table
Importantly, several metabolites identified in mouse models of AD (Fig.
At baseline in AD (i.e.
preclinical AD stage) compared to CON males, we observed significantly lower plasma arachidonic acid levels (p = 0.020), and a trend toward lower threonine (p = 0.159) and higher palmitoleic acid (p = 0.182), with no change in oleic acid (p = 0.550, Fig.
Conversely, at baseline in AD compared to CON females, we observed significantly lower oleic acid (p = 0.024), and a trend toward lower levels of linolenic acid (p = 0.093) and hypoxanthine (p = 0.093) with no change in arachidonic acid (p = 0.524, Fig.
These results suggest sex-dependent systemic metabolic alterations in humans who are asymptomatic, but will eventually express clinical symptoms of AD.
Importantly, when these results are not sex stratified, in AD compared to CON, we observe a significantly lower arachidonic acid (p = 0.037) and oleic acid (p = 0.040), and a trend toward lower levels of threonine (p = 0.198) (Fig.
At the follow-up visit where converters expressed AD clinical symptoms, we observed similar changes to baseline measures, with a more pronounced reliance on ketone body metabolism.
In male AD compared to CON, we observed significantly lower arachidonic acid (p = 0.008), oleic acid (p = 0.020), and a trend toward lower 3OH-butyrate (p = 0.130) and linoleic acid (p = 0.084) (Fig.
In female AD compared to CON, we observed higher threonine (p = 0.002), and a trend toward for higher alanine (p = 0.163) and linoleic acid (p = 0.144), with a trend toward lower 3OH-butyrate (0.062) (Fig.
In the combined male and female analysis, we observed significantly lower 3OH-butyrate (p = 0.020), oleic acid (p = 0.015), arachidonic acid (p = 0.010) and higher threonine (p = 0.031) (Fig.
Overall, these data suggest a progressive systemic deterioration of lipids and ketone bodies in response to a metabolic shift away from glucose oxidation that differs substantially between male and female AD subjects.
It is important to note that in a prior paper using only BIOCRATES data in a similar cohort, we reported on specific amino acids that discriminated between converter and non-converter samples
We then asked which metabolites in the entire data set (not restricted to the metabolic alterations observed in AD mice) could be utilized to separate individuals who would remain cognitively normal and those that would progress to AD using a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).
Interestingly, the top 2 results of the top 20 depicted were an accumulation of pyruvate and depletion of 3OH-butyrate in AD vs. CON subjections (Fig.
These results suggest an initial impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation leading to the accumulation of pyruvate, the terminal carbon source for acetyl-CoA generation by glycolysis, and a switch to ketone body metabolism as demonstrated by the depletion of the primary ketone body, 3OH-butyrate in AD (Fig.
We then determined which metabolic pathways were altered by performing metabolite set enrichment (MSE) pathway analysis between converters and non-converters.
Results indicated that the top altered pathways are indeed consistent with an increase in fatty acid oxidation including: oxidation of branchchain fatty acids, bile acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, lysine degradation, spermidine and spermine biosynthesis, β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, mitochondrial β-oxidation of medium chain fatty acids, and tryptophan metabolism (Fig.
PLS-DA analysis at the follow-up time-point revealed that the top metabolites differing between individuals remaining cognitively normal and progressing to AD were indeed the depletion of plasma 3OH-butyrate, followed by the accumulation of pyruvate (Fig.
MSE pathway analysis revealed an increased oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, lysine degradation, pyrimidine metabolism, βoxidation of long-chain fatty acids, threonine and 2-oxobutanoate degradation, steroid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, folate, purine, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation and PPP metabolism (Fig.
These altered pathways are remarkably similar to those observed in our mouse models of AD, and further suggest progressive sex-dependent systemic metabolic remodeling from glucose to fatty acid metabolism in response to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Sex-dependent metabolic alterations in autopsy confirmed human AD brain tissue
To investigate whether the systemic metabolic alterations observed in AD mice and humans were relevant within the brain, we analyzed brain tissue metabolomics from the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) within a subset of participants from the autopsy program of the BLSA
The BLSA autopsy subsample is not significantly different from the overall BLSA cohort in terms of rates of dementia and clinical stroke
Similar to our findings in serum, we identified sex-dependent metabolic alterations in similar pathways in AD (n = 16, male n = 8, female n = 8, supplemental Table
Similar to findings in serum, in males with AD compared to CN-and not in females-we observed significantly lower arachidonic acid (p = 0.006), and a trend toward lower fumaric acid (p = 0.183) (Fig.
We observed significant correlations in males with Braak and CERAD scores, respectively: Arachidonic acid (p = 0.034, p = 0.005) and fumaric acid (p = 0.046, p = 0.039) were negatively correlated with neurofibrillary tangles (Fig.
In females with AD compared to CN, we observed significantly lower hypoxanthine (p = 0.041), a purine derivative and breakdown product involved in nucleotide salvage
Importantly, these changes were also significantly correlated in females with Braak and CERAD scores, respectively: hypoxanthine (p = 0.048, p = 0.004) and 3OHbutyrate (p = 0.394, p = 0.025) were negatively correlated and ribose-5-phosphate (p = 0.012, p = 0.015) was positively correlated with neurofibrillary tangles (Fig.
In combined male and female analysis, we observed higher G6P (p < 0.001), ribose-5phosphate (p = 0.006) and a non-significant trend toward increased 2-hydroxyglutarate (p = 0.114), and lower levels of arachidonic acid (p = 0.009), hypoxanthine (p = 0.018), and a non-significant trend toward lower 3OH-butyrate (p = 0.255) between AD and CN samples (Fig.
These metabolite alterations significantly correlated with Braak and CERAD pathology scores, respectively, as follows: 3OH-butyrate (p = 0.141, p = 0.04), arachidonic acid (p = 0.14, p = 0.021), ribose-5-phosphate (p < 0.001, p = 0.003), hypoxanthine (p = 0.045, p = 0.003), and 2-hydroxyglutyrate (p = 0.812, p = 0.044) (Fig.
It is noteworthy that three metabolites (arachidonic acid, 3OH-butyrate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate) significantly correlate with amyloid pathology (CERAD), but not tau pathology
The most striking finding was the significantly higher G6P in brain tissue in both males and females with AD, and combined analysis (p = 0.004, p = 0.014, p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig.
As previously mentioned, G6P is the product of the initiating and ratelimiting enzymatic step of glycolysis, the phosphorylation of glucose following cellular uptake to G6P by hexokinase (HK).
G6P is also the rate-limiting substrate for the PPP, which was identified in MSE pathway analysis in both mouse plasma (Fig.
Furthermore, G6P was significantly positively correlated with Braak and CERAD scores in both males and females, and combined analysis (Braak: p = 0.001, p = 0.006, p < 0.001, respectively; CERAD: p < 0.001, p = 0.024, p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig.
Overall, these observations suggest that impairments in glycolysis and the PPP may involve an impairment in G6P metabolism and downstream impairments of purine biosynthesis and mitochondrial energy production in the brain of both male and female AD subjects.

Increasing [glucose-6-phosphate] decreases mitochondrial hexokinase
G6P accumulation has been reported to impair glycolysis via a feedback inhibition mechanism on HK enzymatic activity by dissociating HK from the mitochondrial voltagedependent anion channel (VDAC)
In a prior paper using BLSA brain autopsy data
reduced HK phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase activity.
Our results here support these prior findings suggesting that in both mice and humans with AD, HK dysfunction and the accumulation of G6P, a branch point between the oxidative PPP and glycolysis, likely represents a critical step affected by AD pathogenesis.
Since we observed striking similarities in these pathways in mice and humans with AD, we sought to investigate whether the isolated synaptic mitochondria from the mouse hippocampus had altered levels of HK.
We observed a significant decrease in synaptic HK levels in male 3×β mice, and in female POLβ, 3×, and 3×β mice (Fig.
Interestingly, we also observed that female WT mice have significantly higher expression of HK in hippocampal synaptosomes (Fig.
While these independent observations imply that G6P mediated mitochondrial dissociation of HK could contribute to the glucose hypometabolism commonly observed in AD, we wondered whether the accumulation of G6P could directly cause the mitochondrial dissociation of HK.
To test this hypothesis, we isolated mitochondria from human U2OS cells and incubated them with increasing concentrations of G6P (15.6 μM-500 mM) while respiring on complex I substrates (pyruvate 5 mM and malate 2.5 mM) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to measuring levels of HK that remained bound to mitochondria.
Indeed, we observe a dose-dependent dissociation of HK from VDAC, with ~ 50% HK dissociation when [G6P] approaches millimolar concentrations (Fig.
These results establish that the accumulation of G6P observed in the brain of human AD subjects could cause impaired glycolytic flux via the mitochondrial dissociation of HK and consequent inhibition of HK activity

Discussion
Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent age-related dementia.
To date, the efficacy on antiamyloid and anti-tau therapeutics have failed several large clinical trials demonstrating the importance of reconsidering the etiological mechanisms of AD to prevent or delay the progression of this devastating disease.
Moreover, the higher prevalence of AD in women than men strongly suggest the need for a precision, sex-targeted therapeutic approach to combat AD.
Metabolic alterations including cerebral glucose hypometabolism precede cognitive impairment by decades, and diabetes mellitus type II is a risk factor for developing AD
These observations suggest that brain and systemic metabolic remodeling occurs early and likely contribute to the etiology of AD.
In the present study, we utilized a cross-species approach to evaluate conserved metabolic alterations in two transgenic mouse models, human cell lines, two C. elegans AD strains, and two cohorts of human AD subjects.
We consistently observed evidence of metabolic remodeling with a shift from glucose to lipid metabolism in all laboratory models and humans.
Utilizing two mouse models of AD, we found cortical impairment of mitochondrial complex-I-dependent respiration in female synaptosomes, with no observable impairment, but rather an increased complex IV function, in cortical synaptosomes isolated from male AD mice (Fig.
Moreover, we identify a novel and important role for base excision DNA repair deficiency in hippocampal neuronal mitochondrial impairment (Fig.
In astrocyteenriched non-synaptic mitochondria, we observed an increase in complex-II-dependent respiration implying an upregulation of astrocyte fatty acid metabolism that was subsequently supported by systemic increases in fatty acid and ketone metabolism pathways (Fig.
Importantly, we determined that this metabolic shift to lipid metabolism is a compensatory physiological adaptation essential for cellular and organismal survival using in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of AD (Fig.
Subsequent evaluation of similar metabolic alterations in humans demonstrated a strikingly consistent alteration in glucose and lipid metabolism pathways in human AD serum (Fig.
The majority of these alterations significantly correlate with Braak/CERAD pathology, further supporting the relevance of the identified metabolic alterations to AD pathogenesis (Fig.
A working model summary of these findings is depicted in Fig.
These findings are largely consistent with literature describing glucose hypometabolism and systemic metabolic syndromes predisposing individuals to develop AD.
Together these data provide novel insight into the critical need for a sex-specific approach to therapeutic development for men and women affected by AD.
Sex differences in AD pathophysiology have become the subject of intense research.
A recent study identifies sex and cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in human AD
Sex differences in mitochondrial metabolism and cell death pathways have been described
In the present study, we contribute to this effort by identifying distinct sites of mitochondrial ETC inhibition in a sex, brain region, and cell-type-dependent manner.
These results are consistent with a report demonstrating the rate of cortical atrophy is significantly faster in female and compared to male AD subjects
These data support the notion that mitochondrial impairment is a significant driver of the progression of neurodegeneration in AD
Indeed, a recent study determined that impaired mitochondrial calcium homeostasis precedes tau and amyloid beta pathology in mice
It is evident that there are distinct sex-specific mechanisms of metabolic impairment that likely contribute to the higher prevalence of AD in females, however, there are also likely shared mechanisms of metabolic impairment in males and females.
The underlying mechanisms of glucose hypometabolism have been reported to include decreased glucose uptake
Consistent with our recent previous report of reduced HK activity
Importantly, G6P accumulation in the brain of human AD subjects and correlations to pathology were observed in both men and women, suggesting that this is a common mechanism of metabolic impairment in AD.
We further establish a proof-ofprinciple that G6P can causally dissociate HK from mitochondria and estimate that cytoplasmic concentrations approaching millimolar values are required for HK inhibition.
G6P is also the rate-limiting metabolite for the PPP, which is the principle source of cytoplasmic NADPH for endogenous antioxidant defense systems, and downstream nucleotide synthesis for DNA integrity maintenance.
G6P, therefore, connects glucose hypometabolism, DNA repair and oxidative stress
Interestingly, one study suggests that HK dissociation from VDAC is a signal to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
The most obvious culprit for G6P accumulation is a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), however, studies measuring G6PDH activity have yielded conflicting results
Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms resulting in G6P accumulation in the AD brain.
More broadly, determining the trigger for the observed metabolic shift from glucose to lipid metabolism is of utmost importance.
Studies have implicated circulating 17β estradiol levels as a putative explanation for why females may be at a higher risk for developing AD
Limitations of the current study include the lack of estradiol measurements within AD subjects as well as the reliance on postmortem brain tissue metabolite quantifications.
Postmortem interval, although not significantly different between control and AD groups within this study (supplemental Table
It is important to consider this caveat when interpreting results from postmortem tissues.
Further investigation aimed at identifying the cause of the identified metabolic alterations in AD is warranted.
Cunnane and colleagues have recently demonstrated that while brain glucose metabolism declines with normal aging and more severely in AD, the capacity to metabolize ketone bodies, the brain's only other energy source (during starvation or ketogenic diet), remains normal in older individuals and AD patients
Ketone body utilization is linearly dependent on the plasma concentrations of major ketones acetoacetate and 3OHhydroxybutyrate
These data are from human subjects on prolonged fasting regimens or a diet rich in medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketone precursors.
Indeed, several small clinical trials in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment illustrate an exciting proof-of-principle that metabolic interventions can improve cognitive processing and perhaps alter AD disease trajectory
These therapeutic strategies were recently labeled "neuroketotherapeutics", and have shown some efficacy in preventing cognitive decline in individuals with AD
Our data support the advancement of metabolic interventions such as neuroketotherapeutics to bypass dysfunctional glucose metabolism in hopes of stalling or preventing AD pathogenesis.

Conclusions
The present study provides several novel insights supporting the need to consider sextargeted metabolism-modifying therapeutic approaches to combat the increasing incidence of AD.
We identify mechanisms of impaired brain mitochondrial function, glycolytic inhibition, and the natural physiological adaptive mechanisms upregulated to compensate for impaired cellular energy production in AD.
These data argue for a refocusing of AD prevention on early metabolic changes, and describe the critical role of biological sex and DNA repair deficiency in driving neurodegeneration in AD.
Targeting these pathways with a careful consideration of intrinsic metabolic differences between male and female physiology will provide a greater chance for developing efficacious therapies using a personalized medicine approach to prevent or delay the progression of AD.
A substantial further effort is required to understand the metabolic underpinnings of AD etiology and pathogenesis.

Glucose hypometabolism occurs with aging, possibly due to the accumulation of glycolysis intermediate glucose-6-phosphate, thereby causing feedback inhibition on rate-limiting glycolysis enzyme hexokinase via the dissociation of hexokinase from mitochondrial VDAC.
This glucose hypometabolism is further exacerbated by a decline in synaptic complex I function in the cortex of female AD mice.
Impaired glycolysis forces a metabolic shift toward fatty acid and ketone metabolism that corresponds with increased non-synaptic (astrocyte-enriched) mitochondrial complex II function of the cortex
