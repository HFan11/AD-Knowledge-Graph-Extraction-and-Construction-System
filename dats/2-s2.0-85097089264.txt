New therapeutics beyond amyloid-β and tau for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease
As the population ages, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease in elderly people, will impose social and economic burdens to the world.
Currently approved drugs for the treatment of AD including cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist (memantine) are symptomatic but poorly affect the progression of the disease.
In recent decades, the concept of amyloid-β (Aβ) cascade and tau hyperphosphorylation leading to AD has dominated AD drug development.
However, pharmacotherapies targeting Aβ and tau have limited success.
It is generally believed that AD is caused by multiple pathological processes resulting from Aβ abnormality, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and oxidative stress.
In this review we updated the recent development of new therapeutics that regulate neurotransmitters, inflammation, lipid metabolism, autophagy, microbiota, circadian rhythm, and disease-modified genes for AD in preclinical research and clinical trials.
It is to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and multiple-target intervention, which may provide a promising outcome for AD treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly people.
Worldwide, ~50 million people were living with dementia in 2019, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year.
The total number of people with dementia is projected to reach 152 million in 2050
As the population ages, AD will undoubtedly impose significant social and economic burdens to the world.
Currently approved drugs for AD in clinical use, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs, including donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist (memantine), have therapeutic effects on symptoms but do not effectively slow the progression of the disease
Although great efforts have been made to develop new drugs for AD, current clinical trials have not yet yielded promising results.
Amyloid-β (Aβ)-targeted immunotherapies and β-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors such as AN-1792
Only a few therapeutics targeting Aβ and tau are currently still in clinical trials, including CAD106
Increasing evidence has shown that the pathogenesis of AD is a complex pathological process.
Senile plaques of deposited Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau are the two main pathological hallmarks of the AD brain.
These abnormally accumulated proteins can cause synaptic damage, neuritic injury, and neuronal death, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment
In addition to Aβ and tau pathologies, evidence has also shown that chronic activation of the immune system by these protein aggregations may result in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines; chemokines; and neurotoxins including reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide, and excitatory amino acids, which can cause further neuronal damage and neurodegeneration
Excessive ROS production and impaired antioxidant defense cause oxidative stress in the AD brain, as evidenced by significantly increased oxidation products of proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA
Mitochondrial dysfunction featuring reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased permeability, and excessive ROS production has also been reported in AD
Furthermore, the autophagy-lysosome system that degrades Aβ and various forms of tau protein has been found to be compromised in the AD brain
On the other hand, acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter in brain areas including the cortex, basal ganglia, and basal forebrain, and cholinergic transmission is critical for memory, learning, attention, and other higher brain functions
The cholinergic hypothesis of AD pathogenesis suggests that dysfunction and degeneration of cholinergic neurons in limbic and neocortical systems contribute substantially to the memory and orientation loss, behavioral alterations, and abnormal personality that arise in AD patients
Thus, ChEIs that increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses are helpful for relieving symptoms of AD.
In addition to cognitive impairment, behavioral and psychological symptoms such as agitation, aggression, depression, apathy, nighttime behaviors, and sleep disturbance are also reported in AD patients
New pharmacotherapeutics for agitation and psychosis associated with AD, such as pimavanserin, scyllo-inositol, and mibampator, are in clinical trials
In this article, we will focus on therapeutics for cognitive symptoms in AD beyond Aβ and tau in preclinical research and in clinical trials.
In addition, since there is a strong correlation between sleep disturbance and cognition
It is believed that with a better understanding of the disease mechanisms of AD, more desirable and effective therapeutics will be developed to slow or even reverse the progression of AD.

THERAPEUTICS REGULATING NEUROTRANSMITTERS New ChEIs
Based on the cholinergic hypothesis of AD, acetylcholine enhancers (including ChEIs) that can increase the level of acetylcholine at synapses may be helpful for AD treatment.
Analogs and derivatives of the approved drugs donepezil and tacrine showed potential cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitory activity.
A novel donepezil analog hybrid compound containing 2,3-dihydro-5,6-dimethoxy-1H-inden-1-one and piperazinium salts, which have inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), was less toxic than donepezil and inhibited BChE more effectively than donepezil or galantamine
Tacrinehydroxamate derivatives exhibited inhibitory activity against ChEs and histone deacetylase, and they also showed suppressive effects on Aβ42 self-aggregation and Aβ fibril formation
Some natural compounds and herbal extracts are ChEIs that might be candidates for AD treatment.
ZT-1, a novel analog of huperzine A, was well-tolerated by healthy volunteers
Two benzophenanthridine alkaloids from Zanthoxylum rigidum root extract, namely, nitidine and avicine, showed dual inhibition of AChE and BChE and presented moderate Aβ42 anti-aggregation activity and monoamine oxidase A inhibition
Helminthosporin, an anthraquinone isolated from Rumex abyssinicus Jacq., showed dual inhibitory action on AChE and BChE along with high blood-brain barrier permeability
Other potential ChEIs are also under investigation.
Methanesulfonyl fluoride, an irreversible inhibitor of AChE, was proven to be well-tolerated by healthy volunteers in a randomized placebocontrolled Phase I study
3-Arylbenzofuranone derivatives with AChE inhibitory activity similar to that of donepezil can also block monoamine oxidase B
A bambuterol derivative lacking one of the carbamoyloxy groups on the benzene ring exhibited excellent ChE inhibition and the potential to permeate the blood-brain barrier, as did its analogs
New NMDA receptor antagonists Excitatory amino acid signaling, such as excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptors, is critical for synaptic plasticity and the survival of neurons.
Excessive NMDA receptor activity results in excitotoxicity, which is mediated by excessive Ca 2+ entry into neurons and causes gradual loss of synaptic function, neuronal death, and neurodegeneration in the AD brain
Thus, NMDA receptor antagonists are potent anti-AD drugs.
RL-208, a new NMDA receptor blocker, was shown to improve synaptic plasticity and decrease the protein levels of cyclindependent-like kinase-5 (CDK5) and the p25/p35 ratio, consequently lowering the phosphorylation of tau
JCC-02, N-(3,5dimethyladamantan-1-yl)-N′-(3-chlorophenyl) urea, is a novel NMDA receptor inhibitor for the treatment of AD, exhibiting blood-brain barrier permeability and anti-AD activity that improves cognitive and memory function
A synthesized heterodimer (DT-010) of components isolated from the Chinese herbs Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. and Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.
showed a protective effect against excitotoxicity by blocking the NMDA receptor in vitro
Another compound, rhynchophylline, isolated from the Chinese herb Uncaria rhynchophylla, also showed inhibitory activity against NMDA receptors
Adrenoceptor agonists Guanfacine, an α-2A-adrenoceptor agonist that acts at postsynaptic α-2A receptors on prefrontal cortex spines, can strengthen the connectivity of the prefrontal cortex and improve its cognitive function by inhibiting the opening of potassium channels by cAMP
A randomized clinical trial showed that guanfacine failed to improve prefrontal cognitive function in older individuals
5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor antagonists 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors in cortical and limbic areas are involved in cognition and emotional regulation
5-HT 6 receptor blockade may induce acetylcholine release and restore acetylcholine levels
5-HT 6 receptor antagonists were shown to have cognitive enhancing properties, with a modest side-effect profile
However, idalopirdine, a selective 5-HT 6 receptor antagonist, did not improve cognition compared with placebo in three Phase III randomized clinical trials including 2525 patients
Two other 5-HT 6 receptor antagonists, intepirdine and SAM-760, also failed to improve cognition in AD patients when compared with placebo in Phase II and III trials
SUVN-502, a novel orally active 5-HT 6 receptor antagonist meant to be used as an adjunct to donepezil and memantine, is now under investigation

OTHER NEW THERAPEUTICS Gut microbiota regulators
The gut microbiota, composed of a large number of microorganism species, is known to be associated with cognitive decline and AD
The gut microbiota plays very important roles in immune system development, barrier fortification, vitamin production, and nutrient absorption
A clinical trial indicated that probiotic supplementation could improve cognitive function and mood in community-dwelling elderly individuals
Sodium oligomannate (GV-971) is an orally administered mixture of acidic linear oligosaccharides derived from marine brown algae
GV-971 was developed by Shanghai Green Valley Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of AD and was approved by China's regulators for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD in November 2019
A study reported that GV-971 could remodel the gut microbiota by decreasing the concentrations of phenylalanine and isoleucine in the feces and blood and reducing T helper 1-related neuroinflammation in the brain
In addition, GV-971 can easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier to directly bind to Aβ and inhibit Aβ fibril formation

Anti-inflammatory drugs
Neuroinflammation is considered an important pathological mechanism that contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.
Chronic activation of the immune system results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and toxic factors
Thus, antiinflammatory drugs may also be worth considering as potential anti-AD therapeutics
A meta-analysis showed that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of AD in observational studies; however, in a single randomized controlled trial, NSAIDs showed no significant effect on AD risk
Minocycline, an antiinflammatory tetracycline, was able to protect against the toxic effects of Aβ in vitro and in animal models of AD but did not delay the progress of cognitive or functional impairment in AD patients in a clinical trial

Lipid metabolism regulators
Changes in lipid metabolism, apolipoproteins, and leptin are correlated with AD
The apolipoprotein ɛ4 isoform variant is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD
Fish oil rich in ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is believed to be beneficial for cognitive function
A study of 1293 older subjects with high cardiovascular risk found that multidomain intervention combined with polyunsaturated fatty acids might improve orientation and episodic memory
However, a 3-year multicenter trial of 1680 participants showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids had no significant effects on cognitive decline
Statins are a group of drugs commonly used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
A preclinical study found that statins were able to reduce Aβ levels in yeast
However, other studies and meta-analyses implied that there was insufficient evidence supporting the efficacy of statins in treating AD or lowering AD risk

Autophagic modifiers
Autophagy is a cellular degradation system that clears aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles
Autophagy in microglia is able to degrade extracellular Aβ fibrils, and the autophagylysosome system can degrade tau protein in various forms
Thus, the use of autophagy inducers to promote the degradation of Aβ or tau may be a potential therapy for AD.
Rapamycin and its analogs methylene blue and trehalose were shown to protect against Aβ and tau in AD animal models
Quercetin-modified nanoparticles were also reported as a potential autophagy inducer to treat AD

Circadian rhythm regulators
Epidemiological studies have shown that ~40% of AD patients have various types of sleep disorders
Evidence in animals also indicated that circadian rhythm and sleep disturbances were associated with cognitive impairment and Aβ production and removal
Thus, therapeutics targeting circadian rhythm and sleep regulation might be beneficial for AD patients.
Melatonin is a hormone mainly generated in the pineal gland that regulates the circadian rhythm and shows neuroprotective effects against tau pathology
A 6-month multicenter clinical trial showed that prolonged-release melatonin, compared with placebo, had positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients.
However, an earlier study showed that melatonin was not effective for the treatment of insomnia in AD patients
Ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, was shown to provide protection against delirium in elderly subjects
Suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep via selective antagonism of orexin receptors, was reported to ameliorate cognitive impairments and AD pathology in a mouse model of AD

Natural compounds
The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 is widely used in the treatment of neurological disorders, including AD.
Studies showed that EGb 761 could significantly improve cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living in patients with mildto-moderate dementia and relieve symptoms in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
Ginkgolide A, another compound extracted from Ginkgo biloba, was found to attenuate Aβ-induced abnormal depolarization and inhibit NMDA receptors
Curcumin, a free radical scavenger with anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to permeate the blood-brain barrier, was reported to downregulate glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and CDK5
Dietary supplementation with curcumin could reduce circulating levels of GSK-3β and alleviate markers related to insulin resistance to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD
Coconut oil is a source of ketone bodies that can provide direct cellular energy.
A randomized controlled trial showed that a Mediterranean diet enriched with coconut oil seemed to improve cognitive function in patients with AD; the effect differed by gender

Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) inhibitors
The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a receptor that plays important roles in Aβ clearance, βand γsecretase regulation, and activation of the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in AD
Azeliragon (TTP488) is an orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of RAGE that showed promising results in preclinical and Phase IIb studies
However, a Phase III trial of azeliragon was terminated due to a lack of efficacy.
Another Phase III trial in mild AD is still underway.
σ-1 receptor agonists Activation of the σ-1 receptor was shown to have neuroprotective effects and could reduce key pathophysiological processes in AD, including hyperphosphorylation of tau and oxidative stress
Blarcamesine (ANAVEX2-73), a selective σ-1 receptor agonist, was reported to exhibit good safety and tolerability in patients with mild-to-moderate AD in a Phase IIa clinical study
Phase IIb/III clinical studies are ongoing.
AVP-786 is a compound consisting of a combination of deuterated (d6)-dextromethorphan and an ultralow dose of quinidine; in vitro and in animal models, this drug was reported to be a σ-1 receptor agonist, a serotonin reuptake and glutamate release inhibitor, and an NMDA receptor antagonist
It is now in clinical trials for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD

GENE AND CELL THERAPIES
Antisense therapy Antisense therapy uses antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to target mRNAs in order to preferentially alter mRNA expression.
An ASO against Aβ precursor protein was reported to improve learning and memory and reduces neuroinflammatory cytokines in a mouse model of AD.
Another study demonstrated that an ASO targeting histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) mRNA could improve memory in mice
The codelivery of an antisense transcript (short hairpin RNA) against BACE1 and an antioxidant was also shown to remarkably improve the spatial learning and memory capabilities of AD mice
MicroRNA (miR) therapy MicroRNAs (miRs) are short, single-stranded RNAs that modulate protein expression.
They play regulatory roles in neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine morphology, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic plasticity
Preclinical studies indicated that miRs including miR-298, miR-31, miR-146a, miR-34a-5p, and miR-125b-5p showed anti-AD properties

Stem cell therapy
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based stem cell therapy can be used in the treatment of AD by various mechanisms, including reduction of neuroinflammation, removal of Aβ and tau, functional recovery of autophagy, restoration of blood-brain barrier function, augmentation of acetylcholine levels, and restoration of mitochondrial transport
MSCs were reported to improve cognitive deficits and alleviate neuropathology in animal models of AD
A combination of stem cell transplantation and neurotrophic factors could replenish the target neurons and provide an improved microenvironment with neurotrophic factors for nerve repair and regeneration
A recent study showed that intranasal delivery of the MSC secretome also displayed multilevel therapeutic potential for AD
