Early derailment of firing properties in CA1 pyramidal cells of the ventral hippocampus in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model
Gradual decline in cognitive and non-cognitive functions are considered clinical hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
Post-mortem autoptic analysis shows the presence of amyloid β deposits, neuroinflammation and severe brain atrophy.
However, brain circuit alterations and cellular derailments, assessed in very early stages of AD, still remain elusive.
The understanding of these early alterations is crucial to tackle defective mechanisms.
In a previous study we proved that the Tg2576 mouse model of AD displays functional deficits in the dorsal hippocampus and relevant behavioural AD-related alterations.
We had shown that these deficits in Tg2576 mice correlate with the precocious degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and can be restored by L-DOPA treatment.
Due to the distinct functionality and connectivity of dorsal versus ventral hippocampus, here we investigated neuronal excitability and synaptic functionality in the ventral CA1 hippocampal sub-region of Tg2576 mice.
We found an age-dependent alteration of cell excitability and firing in pyramidal neurons starting at 3 months of age, that correlates with reduced levels in the ventral CA1 of tyrosine hydroxylasethe rate-limiting enzyme of DA synthesis.
Additionally, at odds with the dorsal hippocampus, we found no alterations in basal glutamatergic transmission and long-term plasticity of ventral neurons in 8-month old Tg2576 mice compared to age-matched controls.
Last, we used computational analysis to model the early derailments of firing properties observed and hypothesize that the neuronal alterations found could depend on dysfunctional sodium and potassium conductances, leading to anticipated depolarization-block of action potential firing.
The present study depicts that impairment of cell excitability and homeostatic control of firing in ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons is a prodromal feature in Tg2576 AD mice.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration causing cognitive decline associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms
For more than 25 years research in the field has linked the pathogenesis of AD to the so-called "amyloid hypothesis"; yet, the ability of new amyloid β (Aβ)-targeting drugs to provide a real clinical benefit to patients is still controversial, despite being successful in reducing the amyloid charge and other pathophysiological markers
In the last years, even within variability in familial AD models and experimental conditions, functional changes in the hippocampal network preceding the appearance of pathological aggregates were also well documented
All recordings were performed at room temperature (~ 24 o C).
For current-clamp and recording of spontaneous Excitatory Post-Synaptic Currents (sEPSCs), the 'intracellular' pipette solution contained (in mM): 110 K-gluconate, 12 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 Na 2phosphocreatine, 4 Mg 2 -ATP, 0.3 Na 2 -GTP, 0.1 EGTA-K (pH 7.3 with KOH; 295 mOsm).
For biocytinfilling we added freshly weighted biocytin (0.2-0.4 %; Tocris) to the intracellular solution.
Patch-pipettes were pulled (PC-10, Narishige) from thick-walled borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter and 0.86 mm inner diameter; GC150F-7.5;
Harvard Apparatus), coated with Sylgard resin (Dow-Corning 184) and firepolished (MF-830, Narishige) to a tip resistance of 3-8 M .
To improve whole-cell voltage-clamp, series resistance (R s ) was compensated (range 30-70%; average value after compensation 12.6 ± 0.9 M , n = 49).
In current-clamp experiments, the intrinsic properties of pyramidal CA1 neurons were studied within the first 3 minutes after patch rupture; we injected families of current steps (I inj ) ranging in amplitude from -0.2 to 0.6 nA (50 pA increments; 1 s duration) while holding the membrane potential at approximately -80 mV (-78 ± 0.3 mV, 66 neurons) by constant current injection.
No drugs were added to the aCSF.
In voltage-clamp experiments, sEPSCs were recorded holding the membrane potential at -70 mV; estimated reversal potential for GABAergic synaptic currents was E rev Cl -63 mV, thus no blockers were necessary to isolate glutamatergic currents.
Current-clamp recordings were filtered online at 10 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz; synaptic currents were filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz (amplifier in-built 8-pole low-pass Bessel filter and Molecular Devices Digidata 1322A, respectively).
Field Recordings: For field recording experiments, 6-8 months-old mice were anaesthetized with halothane and perfused transcardially with a cold (0.5 -4 °C), oxygenated (95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 ) 'sucrose-slicing' aCSF solution, containing, in mM: 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 10 MgSO 4 , 0.5 CaCl 2 , 25 glucose, 185 sucrose; ~ 300 mOsm, pH 7.4.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
After brain dissection, 350 μm-thick horizontal slices were prepared in sucrose-slicing aCSF; recovery from slicing was performed in normal aCSF at 30 °C (40 min) and then at RT.
For recording, slices were transferred into a submerged chamber of an upright microscope (Axioskop 2-FS; Zeiss, Germany) and perfused with oxygenated normal aCSF (3-4 ml/min; 30 °C) containing, in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 1 MgSO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 Glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH; ~ 300 mOsm).
Field Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded as previously described
Briefly, to elicit standard field responses in the ventral hippocampus, the Schaffer collateral pathway was stimulated (pulse duration 100 μs; one pulse every 30 s) with an aCSF-filled borosilicate glass electrode placed in the striatum radiatum.
The recording electrode (a borosilicate glass electrode filled with aCSF) was positioned in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 hippocampal region, 200-300 μm from the stimulating electrode.
Input-output curves were obtained by measuring the slope of fEPSPs induced by stimulating the afferent pathway with incremental current steps (10 μA increments).
In LTP experiments, if the fEPSP slope recorded appeared stable for at least 20 min the slice was challenged with two consecutive trains of stimuli (each 1-sec long and 100 Hz; 20 s apart) to induce synaptic plasticity; the field response was then recorded for at least 1 h.
The degree of LTP was estimated at 55-60 min after the conditioning train as the mean fEPSP slope normalized to the mean baseline slope.
Field responses were acquired using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier and digitized using a Digidata 1322A (20 kHz sampling).
For both acquisition and analysis of field responses we used pClamp9.2.

Data analysis
The neuron resting potential (RP) was estimated using the amplifier inbuilt voltmeter immediately after gaining cell access.
Analysis of current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings was performed using Igor.Pro 6.32A (WaveMetrics Inc.) with NeuroMatic 2.8
The membrane time constant (τ m ) was calculated in voltage-clamp as weighted tau of the double-exponential fit of the decay of the wholecell current elicited in response to a -5 mV seal voltage-step (V step ; -70 mV holding potential).
The membrane capacitance (C m ) was then calculated as τ m / R s , where R s = V step / I c (peak of the capacitive current).

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
The 'sag' of the membrane potential response to current injection was calculated as the percentage difference between the minimum amplitude of the initial response relative to the minimum amplitude of the steady-state response, both calculated from a 5-ms averaging window with respect to the average baseline (200 ms).
Sag values were obtained for the first three hyperpolarizing current steps (-0.20, -0.15 and -0.10 nA) and averaged
The input resistance (R in ) was estimated as the slope of a linear least-squares fit to the relationship between the amplitude of five sub-threshold steps of injected currents (range: -0.20-0 nA; 1 s duration; cells held at -80 mV) and the steady-state voltage response of the cell.
The rheobase, the amplitude of the injected current necessary to induce the first action potential (AP), was estimated graphically (Clampfit) from the voltage response to a series of 5 pA-incremented consecutive steps of I inj (50 ms duration; range: 0 ÷ 0.4 nA).
To quantify the AP threshold, phase-plane plots of dV m /dt versus V m ('phase plots') were built for the first AP induced during the rheobase protocol.
Spike threshold was estimated as the membrane potential value at which dV m /dt increased suddenly and developed with a monotonic rise
To study cell excitability, curves describing the relationship between the frequency of induced APs and the injected current were compared and their maximal gain was quantified for each cell as the slope of the linear fit to the curve.
Detection of APs was performed in NeuroMatic using a threshold (+ 5 mV) crossing method.
Due to the presence of depolarization-block, we estimated the maximal gain of the f -I curve normally within its first supra-threshold responses.
The peak of the medium after-hyperpolarization (mAHP) was quantified as the minimum value reached by the membrane potential within a time window of 200 ms immediately after the end of the stimulation protocol (average of 5 ms after baseline subtraction).
To quantify the firing adaptation, the Spike Frequency Adaptation (SFA) factor was calculated from the average of the last 2 inter-spike intervals (ISIs) divided by the average of the first 2 ISIs when the neuron fired at ~14
For analysis of sEPSCs, detection of synaptic currents was performed non-automatically using an amplitude threshold crossing approach in Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices; dwell times shorter than 1 ms were skipped).
Three different analysis windows (at least 30-sec long) per cell were scanned and each synaptic event was fitted using a custom-made triple-exponential function (eq.
1; NeuroMatic),

where: TR was the current 10-90% rise-time; and TD n , A n were the n th component of decay and relevant fractional amplitude, respectively.
To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, peak amplitude (I peak ) and kinetic analysis were performed from current fits (NeuroMatic).
Current decay was estimated from the current fit using a double-exponential function (eq.
2); the weighted time constant of the decay (T w ) was calculated as the sum of the fast and slow time constants weighted by their fractional amplitudes (A1, A2).
(2)
Average values of 10-90% rise-time, I peak and T w were calculated for each cell after checking their time stability using the NeuroMatic built-in function derived from a Spearman Rank-Order macro; segments that lacked time stability were excluded.

Immunofluorescence
Mice were anaesthetized with Rompun (20 mg ml-1, 0.5 ml kg-1, i.p., Bayer) and Zoletil (100 mg ml-1, 0.5 ml kg-1, Virbac) and perfused transcardially with 50 ml saline followed by 50 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde in Phosphate Buffer (PB; 0.1 M, pH 7.4).
The brains were removed and post-fixed in paraformaldehyde at 4
°C and then immersed in 30 % sucrose solution at 4 °C until sinking.
Brains were cut into 30 μm-thick horizontal sections using a cryostat and the slices were collected in PB.
For TH immunofluorescent labelling, selected sections were incubated in citrate buffer (10 mM Sodium citrate, pH 6.0 containing 0.05 % Triton X-100; 20 min, 75 °C), rinsed in PB, immersed in blocking solution
(5 % donkey serum, 0.2 % Triton X-100 in PB) for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution (overnight at 4 °C).
After three washes in PB, sections were incubated with a secondary antibody in blocking solution.
For Iba1 and Aβ immunofluorescent labelling, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies in PB containing 0.3 % Triton X-100 and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies.
For 3D reconstruction of immunofluorescent labelling, images were taken as Z-stacks and these were then processed by maximum intensity projection.
J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
All samples were acquired with the same laser settings.
For quantification of TH and Aβ expression levels, images were collected from at least 4-5 slices processed simultaneously from the ventral hippocampus and exported for analysis with ImageJ software (
For analysis of biocytin-filled neurons, slices bearing neurons loaded with biocytin were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 PB for overnight fixation (4 °C).
Then, slices were washed three times in PB and incubated with 555-conjugated Streptavidin in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (4 °C overnight).
Finally, neurons were analysed with Neurolucida 7.5 software (MicroBright-Field; see below and examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM700, Zeiss).
The immunofluorescence labelling specificity was confirmed by using normal serum instead of primary antibodies (negative controls).

Sholl analysis
Iba1 + cells (microglia) and biocytin-filled pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus were analysed by Sholl analysis
Cells were visualised with an optical microscope (DMLB; Leica) equipped with a motorized stage and a camera connected to Neurolucida 7.5 software (MicroBright-Field) that allowed for quantitative 3D analysis of the entire cell compartment.
Only cells that showed intact processes unobscured by background labelling or other cells were included in the analysis.
We evaluated the cell body area and perimeter, number of intersections and total length of processes.
To account for changes of cell complexity in relation to the distance from the soma, concentric circles originating from the soma J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (radii) were spaced 10 μm apart and the number of branch points, branch endings, cell processes intersecting the radii and cell process length were measured as a function of the distance from the cell soma.
For Iba1 + cells, fifteen cells per animal were selected randomly for analysis, all data were subsequently averaged for each mouse.
For biocytin-filled pyramidal neurons, all cells were analysed for intersections of the apical dendrites.

Quantification of TH + fibre density
The quantification of TH + fibre numbers in the ventral hippocampus images was performed from at least 4 slices processed simultaneously and exported for analysis with ImageJ software (
Images were converted in 8-bit and the background was removed using the tool 'region of interest Background subtraction'.
The line scan profile analysis was performed with Image J "line tool".
For each section, four horizontal lines (300 pixels) were drawn randomly in the CA1 and pixel intensity along the line was plotted using the "Plot Profile" tool.
The total number of peaks per 300 pixels (plotted as TH + fibre density) deriving from the intensity matrices were counted manually.
The data obtained from each animal were averaged and the data from 3 mice per genotype were used for the statistical analysis.

Computational modelling
All simulations were carried out using the NEURON simulator (v8.0.0;
Model and simulation files will be available in the ModelDB section of the Senselab database (
acc.n.
267066).
For all simulations, we used a 3D reconstruction of a mouse hippocampal CA1 ventral pyramidal neuron (morphology NMO_114635,
A 60 µm-long synthetic axon with a tapered diameter was added to the morphology.
The electrophysiological traces from a few representative neurons for each strain and age were used as reference to implement a set of biophysically detailed neuron models.
In particular, we chose recordings from: six neurons of 3 months-old WT mice; seven neurons of 3 months-old Tg2576 mice; five neurons of 8 months-old WT mice; and six neurons of 8 months-old Tg2576 mice.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
Passive properties were manually tuned to match the observed input resistance and rheobase for each modelled neuron.
The specific membrane capacitance was fixed at 1 μF/cm 2 and the temperature at 25°C.
Active properties included: a transient Na + conductance; five types of K + currents (Delayed Rectifier, K DR ;
A-type, K V 7; one type of slow Calcium-dependent current, K Ca ; and a voltage and Ca 2+ dependent current); a non-specific I h current; N-, T-and L-type Ca 2+ current; and a simple Ca 2+ -extrusion mechanism with a 100 ms time constant.
The A-type K + and the I h conductance were linearly increasing with distance from the soma.
Channel kinetics and distribution were from a previously published model for CA1 pyramidal neurons
The kinetic parameters of Na + , delayed rectifier K + and K V 7-type K + channels were modified to fit the specific experimental findings of this paper (see the NEURON mod files in ModelDB for full details).
To reproduce the depolarization block, we found that it was necessary to shift the Na + activation kinetic by +5 mV in the axon and by +10 mV in both soma and dendrites
The peak conductance of each channel type was manually tuned to fit, for each modelled neuron, the number of action potentials elicited experimentally as a function of the input current.
To do this, we used a procedure aimed at identifying the minimal changes required to reproduce the experimental findings for each neuron population.
The optimized values were compared using a Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test; only parameters found to be statistically different (p < 0.05) were plotted.

Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software).
Unless stated otherwise, differences between groups were examined using the appropriate paired or unpaired Student's t-test.
When data were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test), we used a Mann-Whitney U test.
f -I curves were examined using two-way repeated measures ANOVA (with genotype and injected current as independent factors); post-hoc comparisons were assessed with Bonferroni's or Tukey's tests.
Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 (*p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001).
All values are expressed as means ± s.e.m.
Neurons with max AP frequency ≤ 5 Hz or with resting potential more positive than -50 mV were arbitrarily excluded from current-clamp analysis (9 excluded out of 71 cells).
Neurons with outlying average frequency of synaptic events were arbitrarily excluded from voltage-clamp analysis (3 excluded from 47 cells).
No correlation was evident between either genotype or age and exclusion condition (data not shown).

Results

Altered excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus of Tg2576 mice
To investigate potential alterations in pyramidal neurons of the ventral CA1 in Tg2576 mice, we compared neurons from WT and Tg2576 mice of either 3 or 8 months of age, corresponding respectively to early and overt synaptic defects in the dorsal hippocampus of Tg2576 mice
Fig.
At these time points ventral CA1 neurons showed physiologically polarised resting potentials, independently of genotype (3 months-old mice: WT -66 ± 1 mV, Tg2576 -66 ± 1 mV; 19 and 17 cells from 5 mice; p = 0.9686; 8 months-old mice: WT -68 ± 3 mV, Tg2576 -65 ± 1 mV; both 13 cells from 3 mice; p = 0.3205).
To assess membrane sub-and suprathreshold intrinsic properties in these cells, we presented neurons with families of current steps.
Whilst the sub-threshold properties investigated appeared substantially unaltered across ages (Table
Thus, whilst rheobase was decreasing with age in WT mice, it stayed unaltered in Tg2576 animals.
Consequently, when comparing ventral CA1 neurons from mice of the same age across strains, we found that the rheobase of Tg2576 pyramidal cells was significantly smaller in younger animals (p = 0.0109) and larger in older ones compared to WTs (p = 0.0160; Fig.
This reflected into the relevant average f -I curves showing that ventral CA1 neurons of 8 months-old Tg2576 mice fired significantly less APs compared to WT neurons (3months: p = 0.5150, F 1, 32 = 0.4336; 8-months: p = 0.0433, F 1, 22 = 4.601; Fig.
To start dissecting the ionic bases of the altered excitability found in Tg2576 animals, we analysed phase plots obtained from the first AP fired in response to the rheobase protocol.
We found that the membrane voltage at which APs were fired (V threshold , V thre ) was more depolarised in 8 months-old Tg2576 mice compared to WTs; instead, no differences emerged in younger animals (3-months: WT -49 ± 1 mV and Tg2576 -46 ± 1 mV, p = 0.2537; 8-months: WT -53 ± 2 mV and Tg2576 -45.7 ± 0.6 mV, p = 0.0043; Fig.
Once over-threshold, WT and Tg2576 pyramidal neurons of both ages showed analogous firing properties, bearing same maximal slope ("gain") of the f -I curves, same maximal AP frequency and same spike accommodation (at the frequency range 10-20 Hz; Fig.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
Journal Pre-proof
Together, these results show that cell excitability (rheobase and V thre ) and evoked firing (f -I curves) are altered in ventral CA1 neurons at early and later phases of disease onset in Tg2576 mice.
Our findings on the V thre of APs in 8 months-old Tg2576 neurons are in line with the analysis of evoked excitability and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the reduced input-output relationship observed in older Tg2576 mice, similarly to what we observed previously in pyramidal cells of the dorsal hippocampus
On the other hand, differently from rheobase, the AP threshold of WT CA1 neurons showed no change along development.
Rheobase is obviously affected not only by the V-gated Na + channel activation threshold, but also by the intrinsic, sub-threshold properties contributing to the readiness of the membrane to fire an AP.
Indeed, when qualitatively considering at once R in and C m (Table

Firing alterations in ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons of Tg2576 mice show early onset
In animal models, some decrease of AP firing rate in CA1 pyramidal cells is a hallmark of physiological aging
We thus asked whether in the Tg2576 mouse model ventral CA1 neurons also suffer from an accelerated rundown of their firing performance with age, compared to WTs.
To investigate this, we compared f -I relationships within strains and along development (rather than across strains at fixed age-points).
For WT neurons, we found that the input-output curves underwent relevant changes with age (Fig.
Secondly, only CA1 neurons from younger WTs could respond to increasing current injections with sustained firing, whilst neurons in older mice partially lost this ability, showing significant reduction of their firing rate (for I inj + 0.6 nA, p = 0.0364; Fig.

J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
When analysing Tg2576 firing along age progression, rather than an analogous or worsened age-dependent alteration of the evoked firing, to some surprise we found that the f -I relationships were almost completely superimposable (p = 0.8473, F 1, 27 = 0.03779; Fig.
Thus, ventral CA1 neurons of younger Tg2576 mice not only lack the increase of cell excitability observed in WTs along development, but also, and importantly,
show anticipated inability to bear sustained firing, a deficit typical of elder WT mice (Fig.
By inspecting the current-clamp recordings we could readily acknowledge that neurons with deficient firing had features typical of the depolarization-block (DB), during which the number of APs drops and the membrane voltage reaches an equilibrium value of approx.
-40 mV or more
We quantified DB by estimating the threshold current for the depolarization-block (that is, the minimal amount of injected current needed to reach the maximal firing frequency observed, MIN I inj ;
Thus, as expected from the rundown of firing performance with age (see Fig.
Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) following one or more APs is known to be a key regulator of neuronal homeostatic firing in general
Although the actual contribution of different ionic conductances to AHP is debated (see
Recently the expression of intracellular APP in dorsal CA1 has been correlated to the modulation of Ca 2+ influx and consequently to the potentiation of postburst AHP
Here, we asked whether the AHP of ventral CA1 neurons was different in Tg2576 mice and found that the mAHP peak was significantly potentiated in Tg2576 animals of 3 months (3-months: WT -2.1 ± 0.3 mV and Tg2576 -4.3 ± 0.4 mV, p = 0.0004; 8-months: WT -2.6 ± 0.4 mV and Tg2576 -3.4 ± 0.5 mV, p = 0.2092; Fig.
This finding suggested that the modulation of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
Journal Pre-proof voltage-or Ca 2+ -sensitive ion channels could play a role in the altered firing of Tg2576 ventral CA1 neurons.
Altogether our current-clamp analysis suggests that in Tg2576 mice the pyramidal neurons of the ventral CA1 suffer from early deterioration of their excitability, thus largely before the appearance of typical ADrelated markers such as Aβ plaques or neuroinflammation.
Indeed, we confirmed the presence of only intracellular Aβ in ventral CA1 neurons, which remained at comparable levels in 8-months old animals, in line with the relatively slow disease progression typical of this AD model (Fig.
Fig.
Also, at 3 months of age no signs of neuroinflammation were present, as suggested by the unaltered morphological profile of resident Iba1 + microglial cells (which showed slight, but significant alteration of their proximal branching only in 8-months old Tg2576 mice; Fig.
Fig.
Instead, and intriguingly, the early deterioration of excitability in ventral CA1 pyramidal cells temporally coincides with the initial loss of VTA dopaminergic neurons, which starts between 2 and 3 months of age in this AD model, as previously reported
We thus pursued the possibility that the impaired excitability borne by CA1 neurons could relate to a lower presence of DA in the VTA projections reaching the ventral hippocampus.
To ascertain this, we performed densitometric analysis of THthe rate-limiting enzyme for DA productionand found that indeed it was strongly reduced in Tg2576 mice (at both 3-and 8-months of age) as well as in 8-months old WT mice compared to 3-months old WTs (Fig.
In particular, TH expression was significantly lower in the ventral CA1 of 3-months old Tg mice compared to WTs of the same age (p = 0.0012) and remained equally low in older Tg mice (p = 0.9913).
Notably, we also observed a significant reduction of TH levels in 8-months old WT mice compared to younger WTs (p = 0.0059), that was however not due to a reduction in TH + fibre density (Fig.
Thus, overall the quantification of TH levels in the ventral CA1 along ages and across strains mirrored both the reduction of neuronal rheobase (Fig.
2), strongly suggesting the existence of a causative link between the two phenomena.

CA3 -CA1 synapse strength of ventral Tg2576 CA1 pyramidal cells is unaltered
We and others reported that Tg2576 mice older than 5-6 months of age show impairment of the hippocampal memory, observed both at behavioural and cellular level in dorsal dentate gyrus, CA3 -CA1 and CA1 -J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f preSub synaptic plasticity
As soon as at 3 months of age however, Tg2576 mice start showing behavioural deficits (fear conditioning performance) reflecting functional (decreased evoked EPSCs and mEPSC frequency), structural (lower spine density and size of dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons)
and biochemical (lower hippocampal GluA1 levels) alterations
Thus, we asked whether analogous alterations affected the ventral CA1 of Tg2576 mice.
To address this, firstly we recorded spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents from CA1 pyramidal neurons of Tg2576 and WT animals.
In line with other reports for this and other AD models
Thus, sEPSCs recorded from WT and Tg2576 CA1 neurons had same average frequency, peak current and kinetics (Fig.
Secondly, we investigated whether the evoked long-term plasticity at these synapses of the ventral hippocampus was defective, similarly to what reported for the dorsal area in 8 months-old animals
In line with what we previously observed for the dorsal hippocampus
Interestingly however, at odds with the dorsal hippocampus we found no difference in CA3 -CA1 LTP between WT and Tg2576 animals (fEPSP normalised peak: WT 111 ± 2 % and Tg2576 118 ± 3 %, p = 0.0763; fEPSP normalised slope: WT 115 ± 3 % and Tg2576 111 ± 9 %; p = 0.6682; Fig.
Thus, albeit ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons in Tg2576 mice had derailed firing since early stages of their development, both excitatory basal synaptic transmission and plasticity in this area were intact.
To validate our functional observations, we performed morphometric analysis of the branching of pyramidal neuron dendrites in the stratum radiatum.
In fact, Sholl analysis of biocytin-filled neurons showed similar number of total apical intersections in WT and Tg2576 neurons, irrespective of the mouse age (Fig.

Computational modelling of excitability alterations in ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons of Tg2576 mice
To shed some light on the possible mechanisms underlying the altered excitability and, specifically, the early onset of depolarization block found in ventral CA1 neurons of younger Tg2576 mice, we modelled the passive properties and the firing behaviour of representative recorded neurons in each condition.
The optimized values of channel conductance in modelled neurons were compared across strains at the two age points studied (3-and 8-months; Fig.
Fig.
The modelling supported the view that altered firing and impaired development of excitability in pyramidal cells of the ventral CA1 of Tg2576 mice start at a very early, pre-plaque phase of the disease.
In details, the models suggested that anticipated appearance of DB in Tg2576 neurons could be related to the decrease of the K DR channel conductance density (Fig.
At 8 months of age, when Tg2576 CA1 neurons showed apparent reduced excitability compared to WTs (see Fig.
Both these conductances changed in Tg2576 mice when comparing model results for younger vs older neurons (Suppl.

Altogether, our computational study suggested that both a shift of sodium channel activation kinetics in the main compartments of modelled neurons

Discussion
We provide evidence that pyramidal cells in the ventral CA1 of the Tg2576 mouse model of AD present altered firing and impaired excitability since very early phases of the disease.
Also, we indicate the depolarization block and derailment of specific conductances (I Na ; K DR ; K Ca ) as possible ionic mechanisms underlying such early alteration.
Finally, we highlight that even in the presence of such derailments, basal transmission and long-term potentiation at ventral CA3 -CA1 synapses remain unaltered compared with age-matched controls.
Previously, we had demonstrated that dorsal CA1 and pre-Sub of these mice bear profound alteration of both neuron excitability and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity, leading to impaired excitatory inputs onto the NAc core
Together, our previous and new findings depict how pyramidal neurons of both dorsal and ventral main output of hippocampal circuitry are profoundly, and yet somehow distinctly, altered in Tg2576 animals since preplaque stages of AD.
Reduced evoked excitability and increased spike V thre found in ventral CA1 of 8 months-old mice are in line with data previously obtained in the dorsal pre-Sub of these animals at the same disease stage
Thus, in both regions some early event (or chain of events) is able to undermine the fine-tuning of AP firing in CA1 pyramidal neurons.
Here we tackled such early events in the ventral CA1 and identified two properties of pyramidal cells that physiologically are associated with aging but appear earlier than normal in Tg2576 mice: reduced rheobase (Fig.
Homeostatic control of firing contributes synergistically with synaptic plasticity to information storage in neuronal networks and memory
Dysregulation of this balance is now considered a major cause of memory impairments in early AD (reviewed in
Thus, synapse weakening and memory deficits could stem from chronic firing abnormalities, in case compensatory mechanisms fail.
CA1 pyramidal cells (like other neurons) can plastically adapt several of their electrophysiological properties to accommodate for modifications of the environment -a property of complex biological system called degeneracy
Modelling studies suggest that in CA1 neurons only few conductances (e.g.
somatic K M , I h and dendritic K DR ) are so crucial to neuronal survival to be normally excluded from degeneracy
Intriguingly, among these key conductances, K M is central in controlling pyramidal excitability
Thus, we hypothesized that some early, persistent perturbation of key conductances could disrupt the homeostatic control of AP firing in Tg2576 ventral CA1 neurons and eventually their ability to pass the upstream information to downstream networks with high fidelity.
Our hypothesis is supported by the observation that, indeed by altering kinetic properties and conductance distribution of K DR and K Ca (and transient I Na ), we could satisfactorily model the firing alterations observed experimentally.
What is the nature of such initial perturbation?
It is worth noting that the early alterations found here in the ventral CA1 of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice are timely with the first detectable degeneration of the VTA DA neurons in this AD model mouse
Of note, we and others had previously shown that excitability, synaptic and behavioural deficits found in older Tg2576 animals could be rescued by sub-chronic intraperitoneal administration of L-DOPA
Similarly,
All these evidences point at lower levels of DA as a possible trigger of the early, pre-plaque alterations found in AD models.
Indeed, here we confirmed that the dopaminergic innervation in the ventral hippocampus is reduced in Tg2576 mice already since 3 months of age, in line with the early derailment of pyramidal neuron properties.
Furthermore, we observed that a reduction of TH levels is also occurring in older (8-months) WT animals (see also
Yet, unlike Tg2576 mice, the reduction of TH levels in older WTs is not due to degeneration of DA neurons in the VTA (see
We can assume that the reduction of DA levels in mature WT animals is a physiological process occurring in parallel with agedependent changes in dopaminergic neuron firing
Thus, in older WTs (8-months), despite the absence of AD-promoting factors like Aβ or neuroinflammation, lower DA levels might start contributing to the observed first signs of reduced firing in ventral CA1 neurons.
This, in turn, would obviously appear even worse in 8-months old Tg2576 mice (see for example the even lower neuronal excitability compared to aged-matched WTs, Fig.
Accordingly, DB and derailment of action potential firing in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, as well as changes in the AHP and intracellular calcium buffering, are common features between aging mice
Such age-dependent alterations usually reflect into changes of animal behaviour, including worsening of cognitive performance
Given the well-characterised role of DA in cognitive functions
Interestingly, our study also highlighted the somehow striking difference emerged when comparing the modifications of synaptic plasticity in ventral and dorsal hippocampus in 6-8 months old Tg2576 animals:
dorsal synapses (CA3 -CA1 and CA1 -preSub) and dendritic spines are all equally affected
This finding is not completely surprising given our growing understanding of functional distinctions between dorsal and ventral hippocampus
In this scenario, it seems acceptable to speculate that the apparent lack of changes in synaptic plasticity in the ventral CA1 might depend on the presumably larger dopaminergic tone present in this sub-region, even in the presence of degeneration of the VTA in Tg2576 animals.
At the same time, the stronger alterations that we and others have previously reported for the dorsal hippocampus might depend on the loss of a relatively J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f

small, yet critical level of dopaminergic control from the VTA or, alternatively, on alterations of the dopaminergic/noradrenergic projections reaching from the locus coeruleus, an aspect worth investigating in detail (for a review see
In conclusion, CA1 pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus of Tg2576 mice show late depression of evoked excitability and depolarised V thre for APs as well as early onset of depolarization-block compared to WT neurons, whilst CA3 -CA1 plasticity stays intact.
These alterations are timely with loss of dopaminergic neurons of the VTA in this AD model.
We thus hypothesize that reduction of homeostatic levels of extracellular DA plays a role in triggering the loop of neuronal derailment eventually leading to hippocampal decline.

According to our computational analysis, the early appearance of depolarization block observed in CA1 neurons from 3-months old Tg mice could be ascribed to a significant decrease of conductance density for K DR channels in these neurons (p < 0.001 vs WT; lower right; open symbols depict neurons not entering the DB state; filled symbols, neurons entering DB).
