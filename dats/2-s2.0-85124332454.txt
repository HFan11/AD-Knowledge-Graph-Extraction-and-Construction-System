The Citrus Flavonoid Hesperetin Encounters Diabetes-Mediated Alzheimer-Type Neuropathologic Changes through Relieving Advanced Glycation End-Products Inducing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
The present study investigates whether hesperetin, a citrus flavonoid, can encounter advanced glycation end-product (AGE)-induced Alzheimer's disease-like pathophysiological changes with the underlying mechanisms.
SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with hesperetin before stimulation with AGEs (200 µg/mL) were assessed in the following experiments.
Hesperetin (40 µmol/L) elevated the reduced cell viability induced by AGEs.
Hesperetin ameliorated reactive oxygen species overproduction and the downregulation of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, triggered by AGEs.
Amyloid precursor protein upregulation, accompanied by the increased production of Aβ, caused by AGEs, was reversed by hesperetin.
However, hesperetin lowered β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 expression, inducing insulin-degrading and neprilysin expression.
In addition, hesperetin downregulated the expressions of the AGEs-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins, including 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein and C/EBP homologous protein, and lowered the phosphorylation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase and activating transcription factor 4. Hesperetin-pretreated cells had a minor apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
Hesperetin is able to upregulate Bcl-2 protein expression, downregulate Bax expression, and decrease caspase-12/-9/-3 activity as well, indicating that it inhibits ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis.
There is a similar effect between hesperetin and positive rosiglitazone control against Aβ aggravation of SH-SY5Y cell injury induced by AGEs.
Thus, hesperetin might be a potential agent for treating glycation-induced Aβ neurotoxicity.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive memory deficits and cognitive decline
The neuropathological symptoms of AD feature amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles with neurons, and synapses loss in the brain areas linked to cognition, learning, and memory
Based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) is a significant cause of AD
Although available therapeutic methods deliver moderate relief of cognitive symptoms that cannot significantly alter these disease's progression due to AD's multifactorial and complex nature, successful therapeutic and preventive interventions are strongly needed
An increasing epidemiological display shows a higher risk of developing AD in diabetic patients
The pathology associated with diabetes-mediated AD involves chronic hyperglycemia accelerating the reaction between glucose and proteins that eventually cause advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation
AGEs bind to the cell surface receptors (RAGEs) to trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to downstream activation pathways associated with amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Aβ production
The clearance of deficiencies of Aβ participates in the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ, which interfere with several cellular processes and result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, to trigger a complex multistep cascade, which finally causes neuronal death and dementia
Once under ER stress, the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) sensor can activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) branches to restore ER homeostasis
However, UPR fails to fix the normal function of ER during prolonged or overwhelming ER stress, and can trigger pro-apoptotic signals by activating the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
CHOP represses the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) gene expression, thus downregulating the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, but promoting the activation and translocation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), to mitochondria
In addition to mediating by a transcription factor-dependent pathway, the UPR can elicit apoptosis by another mechanism: a caspase-dependent path
Caspase-12 is vital in conducting the caspasedependent UPR.
Upon UPR activation, caspase-12 translocates from the ER to cleave and stimulate effector caspase-9 and caspase-3
As mentioned above, disrupting the AGE/RAGE signaling cascade and blockage of ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis may be a potential target for Aβ-mediated aggravation of AD pathology.
Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is therapeutically used to combat hyperglycemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes
Evidence confirms that rosiglitazone protects the cell against oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and lessens AGE-induced damage in neural stem cells
In in vivo models of AD, rosiglitazone significantly improved memory and cognition deficits; these beneficial effects were observed in AD patients as well
Thus, anti-diabetic drugs could be positive in treating AD.
Phytonutrients, also known as phytochemicals from plants, exhibit different biological activities due to the regulation of several cellular molecular pathways and are believed to have practical value for human health
Among the phytonutrients, flavanones have the highest bioavailability of flavonoid compounds
Flavonoids play significant roles in neuroprotective applications, such as protecting against the development of dementia
Hesperetin, a flavanone derivative, is widely distributed among plants and found in daily diets, predominantly in fruits and vegetables, which exhibits many beneficial actions, such as lessening the deterioration of diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis
As oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related to the onset/progression of AD, it revealed that the beneficial effects of hesperetin in neurodegeneration are highly dependent on the antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities
The severity of Aβ accumulation as proportional to oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells was observed
Thus, it is common to use the retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells line to study the effects of natural compounds against the AGE-induced ADlike pathophysiological changes
Our study used rosiglitazone as a positive drug to determine whether hesperetin has a protective impact on AGEs associated with Aβ neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, and to explore the possible mechanisms.

Materials and Methods

Cell Culture
Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (no.
CRL-266) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) were used for the experiments.
The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), Nutrients 2022, 14, 745 3 of 15 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 • C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator.
SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at 1 × 10 6 cells/cm 2 in 100 mm diameter culture dishes in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS to induce neuronal differentiation.
Once the cells were 40-50% confluent, differentiation was initiated by adding 10 mmol/L of retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Treatments for all the experiments were carried out after the five-day differentiation period.

AGE Induction and Treatments
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 6 cells per well in 6-well plates.
Cultures were dissociated in 0.05% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then passaged when the cell was confluent.
For AGEinduction studies, cells were cultured in a fresh medium with 1% FBS for 2 h.
Later, cells were pretreated with hesperetin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat.
# 69097-99-0, purity ≥ 95%) at different concentrations (10-40 µmol/L), or rosiglitazone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat.
# 557366, purity, ≥99%) at 10 µmol/L
The stock solution (100 µmol/L) of hesperetin or rosiglitazone was made by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and diluted in culture medium to the appropriate concentrations for subsequent experiments.
The final concentration of DMSO was ≤0.1%, a level generally harmless to most cells
The following experiments were assessed after treatment.

Cell Viability Assay
The 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) assay used to measure the cellular metabolic activity could be an indicator of cell viability
Cells were exposed to the different concentrations of hesperetin (10-40 µmol/L) or rosiglitazone (10 µmol/L) in the medium for 24 h at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 in the air.
MTT (5 mg/mL of stock in PBS) was added (20 µL/well in 200 µL of cell suspension), then the medium was aspirated and the cells were incubated with MTT dye for another 4 h.
At the end of incubation, the dye was taken out and 100 µL of DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the MTT formazan crystals.
The absorbance of the solution in each well was measured on a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 540 nm, and background optical densities were subtracted from that of each well.
The net absorbance from the wells of the cells cultured with the vehicle (not treated) was taken as the 100% viability.
The data are expressed as percentages compared to the vehicle-treated control.

Determination of Intracellular ROS Levels and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities
Cells were reacted with 10 µmol/L dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 • C in the dark for 10 min.
The change in dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm on a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
The determination of antioxidant enzyme activity, including superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1),
glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px; EC 1.11.1.9),
and catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6),
were performed using an SOD Activity Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cat.
# K335), GPx Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cat.
# K762), and CAT Activity Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cat.
# K773), respectively, following the procedures provided by Bio Vision, Inc. (San Francisco, CA, USA).
The assay for SOD activity was determined by inhibiting the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, with a xanthine-xanthine oxidase used as a superoxide generator
The production of formazan was determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm.
The activity of GSH-Px was estimated based on the assay after the reduction in absorbance at 340 nm due to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate being consumed by glutathione reductase, with the incubation of the sample in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to starting the reaction
The activity of CAT was determined from the decomposition rate of H 2 O 2 to water and oxygen
Enzyme activities were expressed as units per milligram protein.
The protein concentration was measured by using a Bio-Rad protein assay.

Measurements of Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42
The specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, Amyloid β (1-40) Human Assay Kit (Cat.
# KHB348, Invitrogen, California, USA) and Amyloid β (1-42) Human Assay Kit (Cat.
# KHB3441, Invitrogen, California, USA), were used to quantify Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 in cells.
The optical density at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Spectramax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Measurements of Caspase-12, -9, and -3 Activities
A fluorometric substrate kit (Abcam plc., Cambridge, U.K., Cat.
# ab65664), based on detecting the cleavage of the substrate ATAD-AFC (ATAD: acetyl-alanine-threoninealanine-aspartic acid; AFC: 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin), was used to measure caspase-12-like activity.
In brief, aliquots of cellular extracts containing 300 µg of protein were reacted with the ATAD-AFC substrate (final concentration 50 µmol/L) in a reaction buffer and incubated at 37 • C for 2 h.
The fluorescent detection of free AFC after being cleaved from the peptide substrate, ATAD-AFC, at Ex/Em = 400/505 nm was quantified as the caspase-12-like activity.
The activities of caspase-9 (Abcam plc., Cambridge, U.K., Cat.
# ab65608) and -3 (Abcam plc., Cambridge, U.K., Cat.
# ab39401) were measured by the colorimetric assay kits.
In brief, aliquots of cell extracts containing 50 or 100 µg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 37 • C in a reaction buffer, with 100 µmol/L chromogenic substrates for caspase-9 (Ac-LEHD-pNA), or caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-pNA).
The caspase-9/-3-like activity was determined by measuring the cleavage substrate at 405 nm using a microplate reader.
The results were expressed as relative to those obtained with vehicle-treated control.

Measurement of DNA Fragmentation
The determination of the cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono-and oligo nucleosomes) after induced cell death was quantitated by a cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) with a primary anti-histone mouse monoclonal antibody coated to the microtiter plate, and a second anti-DNA mouse monoclonal antibody coupled to peroxidase
The retained peroxidase in the immunocomplex was determined by incubating 2,2 -azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] as a substrate for 10 min at 20 • C. The color change was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm using a microplate reader (Spectramax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
The optical density values at 405 nm were corrected for the total protein present in each sample.
The data were normalized to the vehicle-treated control.

The Bio-Rad protein assay kit was used to determine the protein concentrations.
The proteins (50 µg/lane) were loaded on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, submitted to electrophoresis, and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
For the renaturation of proteins and the blocking of the unoccupied spaces, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 • C in 0.1% Tween 20-PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk.

AGE-induced oxidative stress significantly influences developing neurodegenerative disorders; thus, enhancing the antioxidant system to reduce oxidative stress could be a logical therapeutic approach
Flavonoid compounds are clarified to antioxidative stress by their antioxidant activity, thus representing beneficial candidates for the protection against oxidative diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD
As an in vitro model for AD studies, the retinoic acid-induced cholinergic differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells was well used
Recently, it has been demonstrated that G protein-coupled estrogen receptors have a direct anti-inflammatory effect in human cholinergic neurons
Although flavonoids with estrogen-like activities could reduce inflammation in cholinergic neurons to consider as prospective neuroprotectants
The obtained results show that hesperetin upregulates the antioxidative capacity to contribute to SH-SY5Y cells against ROS induced by AGEs.
Further research on the ability to counter oxidative stress or examine the mechanisms by which hesperetin protects against AGE-induced neuronal cellular damage is valuable.
One characteristic hallmark of AD is an Aβ accumulation caused by the formation of plaque and Aβ complex toxicity
Evidence has shown that AGE-induced ROS increases the synthesis of Aβ through the proteolytic processing of a transmembrane protein, APP, by upregulating APP processing proteins, such as BACE1, eventually leading to the aggregation and deposition of Aβ to cause neuronal damage
The Aβ levels are highly dependent on Aβ degradation, although much attention has focused on the cellular production of Aβ by amyloidogenic processing.
Among the enzymes that contributed to the cleaving of Aβ, NEP and IDE are the most important, which belong to two metalloprotease family members, M16 (IDE) and M13 (NEP), respectively
Aβ composed a length of 39-43 amino acid residues; 40 amino acid residues (Aβ1-40), as well as 42 amino acid residues (Aβ1-42), are the predominant isoforms
Remarkably, there is the potent aggregation and associated toxicity in Aβ1-42
In AGE-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells, hesperetin pretreatment resulted in the translational downregulation of APP and BACE1 accompanied by a decrease in Aβ secretion.
It revealed that hesperetin might directly ameliorate Aβ overproduction via inhibiting Aβ generation.
As mentioned before, the extent of Aβ expressed in the brain is controlled by Aβ production and its enzymatic degradation clearance pathways, thus investigating the influence of hesperetin on Aβ degradation.
The pretreatment of AGE-cultured SH-SY5Y cells with hesperetin shown in the upregulation of protein levels in IDE and NEP, highlights that the attenuation of Aβ accumulation by this compound is mediated by modulating Aβ-degrading enzymes to increase Aβ degradation.
Therefore, these findings support the notion that the downregulation of Aβ generation and promotion of Aβ degradation are responsible mechanisms by which hesperetin protects against AGE-induced neuronal cellular damage.
Evidence indicates that the accumulation of AGEs is associated with ER stress induction in cells contributing to the pathogenesis of AD and other multiple diseases
During ER stress, GRP78 cooperated with the misfolded proteins to maintain the proteins in foldable states and control the release of three UPR mediators, including inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), PERK, and ATF6 as well
The CHOP protein is the transcription of genes controlled in cell apoptosis, activated by the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 axis under prolonged ER stress
Accordingly, several evidence lines suggest that AD's pathogenesis and progression are closely linked with the UPR signaling pathway controlled byPERK
Therefore, therapeutic targeting on the PERK-associated UPR signaling branches may help to develop a therapeutic approach to treat AD
We observed that hesperetin pretreatment counters the AGE-induced upregulation of proteins under ER stress involving GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and ATF4.
Moreover, the increasing CHOP expression level in SH-SY5Y cells after the induction with AGEs was attenuated by hesperetin pretreatment.
These data suggest the survivability of AGE-treated SH-SY5Y cells enhanced by hesperetin through suppressing ER stress-induced GRP78 to downregulate PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP, finally contributing to neuron protection.
The Bcl2-family protein expression is controlled by several transcriptional factors involving CHOP
Although Bcl-2 family proteins are characterized on the mitochondrion, the proteins are localized at ER and nuclear membranes
Hesperetin prevented protein downregulation in Bcl-2 and, in parallel, reduced Bax expression in SH-SY5Y cells under AGE stimulation.
Therefore, the action of hesperetin on the reductions in AGE-induced ER stress may be associated with recovering the balance between the pro-and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, which finally leads to inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.
Prolonged ER stress can activate caspase-12 that may feed back in a caspase-9-dependent loop involving caspase-3 activation and certainly catalyze apoptosis
We observed that AGEs significantly induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis and increased active caspase-12 that directly activated caspase-9 and the downstream effector caspase-3, supporting the ER stress-mediated activation of the caspase pathway involved in AGE-induced apoptosis
Compared with AGE-treated SH-SY5Y cells, hesperetin-pretreated cells had a minor apoptotic DNA fragmentation and decreased along with the cleavage of caspase-12; in parallel, protein expression and the activity of cleaved caspase-9 and -3 expression were downregulated by hesperetin pretreatment.
Our data suggest that hesperetin prevents the AGE-induced activation of apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells by reducing the caspase-12-dependent ER stress.
There is a similar effect between hesperetin and positive rosiglitazone control against the Aβ aggravation of SH-SY5Y cell injury induced by AGE-mediated ER stress.
In contrast to rosiglitazone playing a minor role in the regulation of Aβ generation
Although PPARs have recently been identified as ahead of the times targets in researching new active drugs for AD
In conclusion, hesperetin protects SH-SY5Y cells against AGE-induced ROS, resulting in a decrease in the Aβ accumulation via the downregulation of Aβ generation and enhancing Aβ degradation.
Additionally, hesperetin resolved PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP activation together with anti-apoptotic effects via the suppression of the caspase-12-dependent pathway in AGE-treated SH-SY5Y cells.
Therefore, we conclude that hesperetin protects neuroblastoma cells against AGE-induced damage via multiple mechanisms, and thus may be an excellent option for potential pre-symptom treatment for neurodegenerative disorders augmented under glycation conditions.
