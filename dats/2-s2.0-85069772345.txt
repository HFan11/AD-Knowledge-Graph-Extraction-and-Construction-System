The Nutritional Components of Beer and Its Relationship with Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s Disease
The prevalence of degenerative diseases has risen in western countries.
Growing evidence suggests that demenia and other cognition affectations are associated with ambient factors including specific nutrients, food ingredients or specific dietary patterns.
Mediterranean diet adherence has been associated with various health benefits and decreased risk of many diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.
Beer, as part of this protective diet, contains compounds such as silicon and hops that could play a major role in preventing brain disorders.
In this review, different topics regarding Mediterranean diet, beer and the consumption of their main compounds and their relation to neurological health have been addressed.
Taking into account published results from our group and other studies, the hypothesis linking aluminum intoxication with dementia and/or Alzheimer's disease and the potential role of regular beer has also been considered.
Beer, in spite of its alcohol content, may have some health benefits; nonetheless, its consumption is not adequate for all subjects.
Thus, this review analyzed some promising results of non-alcoholic beer on several mechanisms engaged in neurodegeneration such as inflammation, oxidation, and cholinesterase activity, and their contribution to the behavioral modifications induced by aluminum intoxication.
The review ends by giving conclusions and suggesting future topics of research related to moderate beer consumption and/or the consumption of its major compounds as a potential instrument for protecting against neurodegenerative disease progression and the need to develop nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic studies in aged people and animal models.

Introduction
Increased lifespan in western countries has resulted in an impressively increased frequency of neurodegenerative diseases, the most common one being Alzheimer's disease
According to WHO, it has been estimated that people with dementia in the world will reach 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050
Neurovascular dysfunction, inflammatory processes, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are critical factors in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative diseases
Alzheimer's disease has been pathologically characterized by neuronal degeneration, amyloidal plaques deposition, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of affected patients.
The decrease in autophagy and the capacity to regulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production have been reported, among others, as disease-emergent factors
The neurodegeneration and hippocampal atrophy are even present at early phases of the disease
While age and apolipoprotein E (APO-E) status represent nonmodifiable risk factors for this disease, diabetes, midlife hypertension, obesity, depression, smoking habits, cognitive inactivity, and low education are some of the known potentially modifiable factors
Recently, the link between obesity and/or the metabolic syndrome with neurodegenerative diseases was proposed
Along this line, Nuzzo et al.
Further, other factors such as chronodisruption
In addition, some pathogens such as the Treponema and Borrela burgdorferi, and some viruses such as the type I herpes simplex (HSV-1), have been suggested to provoke chronical infections that have narrow links with the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.
It has been reported that amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) acts as an antimicrobial; thus, its accumulation would amplify the immune-response and the subsequent brain inflammation
In addition, epigenetic factors, such as the exposition to some toxics, like lead and aluminum
It is well known that lead is a neuronal enhancer of oxidative stress, as it induces free radical accumulation and is able to modify the cellular patron of genome methylation
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a recurrent situation of cortical neuronal atrophy and destruction that mainly affect the parietal and temporal lobules, compromising three fundamental processes for the integral neuronal maintaining: (a) synapsis or interneuronal communication; (b) metabolism; and (c) reparation.
The interruption of any of these processes means a cellular dysfunction that can culminate in apoptosis.
Neuronal death provokes memory failure, personality changes, and other manifestations.
The histopathological signs of Alzheimer's disease are neuritic plaques (composed of extracellular deposits of the Aβ protein) and neurofibrillary tangles (mainly composed of the tau protein)
Several factors such as statins, light-to-moderate alcohol-consumption, Mediterranean diet-adherence, high educational attainment, physically and cognitively stimulating activities, and APO-E metabolism appear associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease onset.
On the other hand, while APO-E remains the strongest predictor of Alzheimer's disease, aging, diabetes mellitus, smoking habits, and lower socioeconomical engagement, among others, are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's development

Aluminum as an Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factor
Aluminum is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust and can be found in measurable quantities in food, soil, water, and air.
The presence of aluminum in water contributes highly to daily aluminum consumption.
Although this metal is normally found in trace amounts in the drinking water, the possibility for low-dose chronic exposure should not be discarded
In addition, the widespread use of products made from, or containing, aluminum ensures the presence of this metal in our bodies.
Several years have passed since the first time that experts strongly claimed that human exposure to aluminum should be limited as it can exert deleterious effects even at small concentrations
Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that the deleterious effects of aluminum in healthy individuals, though inevitable, will be low at normal exposure levels because of their low gastrointestinal uptake and bioavailability, and relatively high urinary excretion
The hypothesis linking aluminum consumption and Alzheimer's disease, although highly controversial, has been supported by several epidemiological studies
In addition, several studies in animal models have given light to this relationship.
Therefore, experimental studies in rats and mice showed that aluminum accumulates in the brain cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum
Other authors
In addition, Oshiro et al.
The brain has been found to be the target organ for aluminum accumulation; hence, this element can be primarily considered as a neurotoxic
According to Kawahara
Aluminum may play an active role in the pathogenesis of critical neuropathologic lesions in Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders, through cross-linking hyperphosphorylated proteins
In fact, Al-induced Alzheimer-like pathological changes were first attributed to tau proteins.
Nevertheless, several biochemical, toxicological, cellular, and genetic studies have supported the "amyloid cascade hypothesis", which explains that the accumulation of Aβ protein (AP) and its neurotoxicity play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
Walton
In addition, aluminum appears to be associated with AP in the brain
It is known that the monomeric form of AP has a random coiled structure, while the oligomeric AP have pleated sheet structures and form insoluble aggregates, named amyloid fibrils.
The neurotoxicity of AP peptides has been studied in an aging model compared to freshly prepared AP in cultured neurons, and it has been demonstrated that the soluble oligomers are synaptotoxic and neurotoxic
On the other hand, this metal can cause pro-oxidant activity.
Exley
As is known, reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with all biological macromolecules, including lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, contributing to neuronal death and, in turn, to the neuropathology associated with several diseases
Although the exact mechanism by which the metal may influence disease processes remains unknown, an increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory events, two major causes of neurological diseases, have been proposed.
Aluminum initiates and propagates an inflammatory response within the aging brain, suggesting that this may be one of the mechanisms by which the metals induce neurodegeneration
In Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice models, dietary aluminum markedly increased lipid peroxidation and Aß-level presence
In isolated systems, aluminum may increase the oxidative stress produced by transition metals such as iron
In line with this observation, our group recently reported that aluminum intoxication contributes to a metal imbalance in the brain, which in turn would be responsible for this organ oxidation and reduced antioxidant capacity
Our results are in line with those of several authors who described that Al3+ decreased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)
Sharma et al.
Moumen et al.
Other studies have demonstrated that aluminum intoxication increased brain TBARS levels and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) expression, suggesting that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation was induced
The induction of these processes has been proposed to be pathogenic for early events of Alzheimer's disease.
Thus, brain TNFα-rise has been shown to precede development of the disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment
In line with the hypothesis that aluminum plays an active role in neurodegenerative diseases, Campbell
According to Lukiw et al.
Furthermore, aluminum exposure has been associated with the impairment of the cholinergic system by altering cholinergic projection function and structure, suggesting how this metal could contribute to the pathological process in neurodegenerative progression
Martinez et al.
It has been described that in Alzheimer's disease, AChE expression is substantially altered, and its activity is decreased in most brain regions.
However, AChE activity is increased within and around the Aβ plaques.
Noremberg et al.
It is important to emphasize that since cerebral AChE is an important regulator of behavioral process, the decreased AChE activity found in the cortex and hippocampus may be an indicator of aluminum-induced damage in the brain.
Kaizer et al. reported a decrease of AChE activity in the hypothalamus but verified an enhancement in the striatum area and no alterations in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum
These results demonstrate that aluminum acts differently depending on the dose and chemical form of Al 3+ administration, the administration route (oral or intraperitoneal), and the time of exposure.
Therefore, aluminum could produce a dose-dependent effect on AChE, stimulating AChE at low levels or short exposures and inhibiting AChE at high doses and/or long exposures periods.
This polarized effect of aluminum on the AChE activity may be due to the direct effect of the metal or due to the peroxidation-induced changes in the structure of membrane following aluminum exposure

Nutritional Factors and Neurological Health-Beer as a Component of the Mediterranean Diet
Cognition at various levels has been consistently associated with the nutritional status that in turn depends on the intake of specific nutrients or food ingredients

Nutritional Factors and Neurological Health-Beer as a Component of the Mediterranean Diet
Cognition at various levels has been consistently associated with the nutritional status that in turn depends on the intake of specific nutrients or food ingredients
Among the most known factors, diet quality has been related to the hippocampus volume (the brain structure that is mainly associated with learning and memory)
In elderly humans, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with reduced atrophy of the brain
In addition, the continuous stress induces the cortisol hormone to increase, a fact that can be a link between chronodisruption and the neurodegenerative disease as a consequence of distortion at neuronal renovation by cortisol at the paracortical gyrus
Based on large scientific evidence, the Mediterranean diet has been considered to be one of the healthiest diets
In fact, when the level of adhesion to a Mediterranean diet model is optimal, there is a reduced risk of inadequate nutrient and bioactive compound intakes, or it has even been positively related with an increase in longevity
The characteristics of this diet have been frequently summarized as a pyramid in which the frequency of food consumption is highlighted.
Since their creation by Keys et al.
Thus, tridimensional pyramids
It is well known Mediterranean diet is characterized by a high proportion of food of vegetable origin, where the presence of virgin olive oil is mandatory
Fish, cheese, and yogurt are moderately consumed, while meat is rarely consumed alone and always forms part of complex dishes.
Wine or beer during main meals is also one of its characteristics
It is well known that the Mediterranean diet has been recognized to be an intangible heritage of humanity and due to its composition plurality, several authors
Beer is one of the most consumed alcoholic beverages around the world.
Table
The Czech Republic shows the highest per head consumption, with more than 150 L per year.
There are other relevant beer consumers with more than 100 L/head/year.
China is the highest consumer in the world, although its per habitant consumption is under 30 L/year
There is growing evidence from large-scale, population-based studies that long-term adherence to the MD may help to protect against dementia and preserve brain and cognitive function in the later stage of the lifespan
According to the PREDIMED study, moderate beer-drinkers have a healthier lifestyle and display an overall dietary pattern closer to that of people following the traditional Mediterranean diet than their nondrinker counterparts (more cereals, legumes, vegetables, fish, and olive oil and fewer dairy products), although they also show a greater consumption of meat and meat products
These authors also reported fewer cardiovascular disease risk factors among beer-drinkers that partially explain the protective role of beer in the development of atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases.

Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on mild cognitive impairment
Gardener et al.
In addition, the Mediterranean diet may confer its favorable effects in cognitive function due to its antioxidant
Oxidative stress has been largely associated with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders
The positive Mediterranean diet effects on the pathogenesis of vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease have largely been linked to the reduction of oxidative stress, through the consumption of abundant antioxidant and antiinflammatory agents (e.g., polyphenols) which, in turn, may alter the expression of inflammatory markers.
Thus, supplemental foods such as extra virgin olive oil and nuts, particularly rich in phenolic compounds [102], may counteract oxidative processes in the brain by reducing, in turn, neurodegeneration.
Other additional mechanisms attributed to polyphenols, such as cerebrovascular blood flow improvement, BDNF synthesis enhancement, neuronal signaling modulation, and neurogenesis stimulation should ameliorate neurologic health
Nonetheless, the presence of Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on mild cognitive impairment

Composition of Beer-Beneficial Aspects on Alzheimer's Disease
Beer, a beverage probably originating in Mesopotamia with the Assyrians, Sumerians, and Babylonians (XXIV century B.C.), is one of the oldest recorded recipes.
The brewing process was first documented on papyrus scrolls by ancient Egyptians
Later, and due to barley crops being abundant, the brewing process extended to North Europe, being a safe alternative to drinking water.

Monks were very much the foremost brewers of the Middle Age, with virtually every monastery having one brewery on site [106].
As is known, beer can be classified according to bottom or top fermentation yeast.
Topfermented beers include brown ale, mild ale, old ale, pale ale, stout, and wheat beer.
The most commonly consumed types of beer in the world are pale lagers, which normally use a bottomfermenting yeast.
Main lagers include pale lager, bock, dunkel, helles, oktoberfestbier/märzen, pilsner, schwarzbier, and Vienna lager.
In addition, there are non-alcoholic beers aimed at sectors of the population that do not want or cannot drink alcohol.
The consumption of beer has grown during the last few decades, mostly among young adults.
Currently, it is one of the most consumed beverages in the world, as shown in Table
Composition can be different from one beer type to another; however, the average beer contains a not insignificant amount of nutrients, such as carbohydrates, protein/amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and other compounds, such as polyphenols (Tables
Among minerals, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, and silicon are the most abundant, while folic acid is the

Among minerals, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, and silicon are the most abundant, while folic acid is the most abundant vitamin, which has even pushed nutritionists to consider this drink as a valuable source of folic acid, as a can of beer (330 mL) contains 20-25 µg folate, an amount that covers 10%-15% and 5%-7% of the recommended intakes for this vitamin in men and women, respectively [107] (Table
In addition, beer has been considered a relevant source of some bioactive compounds with physiological properties (Table
Mean value in g/100 mL of beer.
Modified from Arranz et al.
Figure
Among several components, beer contains the phenolic acids 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, vanillic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and synaptic acids.
Alkaline hydrolysis experiments show that most of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms, and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds
Beer can also be an alcohol source, although its content is rather variable (0%-15% Vol.) depending on the type, ingredients, and fermentation modality.
Most available regular types of beer contain 4%-5% alcohol volumes equivalent to 3.2-4 g alcohol/100 g or 100 mL.
A non-alcoholic beer (also called beer without, beer low in alcohol or loose beer) is a beer with a very low or no alcohol content.
Most non-alcoholic beers are lager, but there are also some ale varieties.
There are four types of non-alcoholic beers: alcohol-free, dealcoholized, low-alcohol, and alcoholic beer.
In the European Union, beer cannot contain more than 1% alcohol by volume to be labeled as "alcohol-free".
In the UK, the legislation stipulates that beer can be labeled as non-alcohol or alcohol-free ('non-alcoholic') when its content does not exceed 0.05% by volume, as dealcoholized up to 0.5% and low-alcohol ('low in alcohol') up to 1.2%.
In the United States of America, beverages containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume are considered non-alcoholic
Every day, more and more non-alcoholic or lowin alcohol-beers are available and appreciated.
Spain appears as the consumers' leader of nonalcoholic beer in Europe, with a 14% rate of total beer consumption, almost triple that of its neighbor,
Several studies in both animals and humans on the potential brain's health benefits of regular beer consumption and of main representative compounds of beer have been realized and are referenced and detailed in Table
Thus, the Helsinki Sudden Death Autopsy Series study, carried out in 125 males, concluded that beer consumption might protect against Aβ aggregation in the brain
The alcohol contained in the beer, apparently, can also exert a neuroprotective effect.
This protection appears linked to signal transduction activation processes potentially involving ROS, several key protein kinases, and increased heat shock proteins
In fact, significant reduced risks of cognitive loss or dementia in moderate, nonbinge consumers of wine, beer, and liquor have been observed.
Compared to late life abstainers, moderate consumers had a larger hippocampal volume, while light consumers had higher episodic memory.
Hops and silicon are two of the most important components of beer, and their composition and effects are briefly described in the following subsections.

Silicon
Review from human trials that evaluate the neuroprotective effect of silica in drinking water

Reviews from tidies of silica in drinking water
Aluminum in water seems to have a deleterious effect when the silica concentrations were low, while the risk of AD was reduced in subjects who had higher daily silica intake The main phenolic compounds from malt (ferulic acid, p-coumaric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, and sinapic acids).
Among them, the ferulic and p-coumaric acids showed a high neuroprotective role and can be considered as possible anti-AD agents Hops and silicon are two of the most important components of beer, and their composition and effects are briefly described in the following subsections.

Hops (Humulus lupulus L.)
Hops, one of the raw materials of beer, brings bitterness and serves as an important source of phenolic compounds.
Polyphenols, mainly catechins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, prenylated chalcones, and proantocianidins, comprise about 14.4% of dried hops cones
Around one fourth of polyphenols in beer originates from hops, and the rest belongs to malt
Moreover, hops provide a resin containing monoacyl phloroglucinols that are precursors of bitter acids (e.g., α-acid humulones and iso-α-acids) during beer production.
Simple phenols, benzoic acid derivatives and cinnamic acid, coumarins, catechins, di-and tri-oligomeric proanthocyanidins, prenylated chalcones, and αand iso-α-acids derived from hops are different classes of polyphenols in beer (Table
Hops and most common regular beers contain 8-prenylnaringenin, which is a potent phytoestrogen
Hops also contain myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins, and resin, as well as 2-metilbutan-2-ol, which is a component of hops brewing
Arranz et al.
According to
These authors demonstrated that the consumption of iso-α-acids, the hops-derived bitter compounds in beer, prevents inflammation and Alzheimer's disease pathology in a mice model, via the regulation of microglia activation, and therefore prevents the inflammation-related brain disorders
The iso-α-acids, as agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), increase microglia phagocytosis of Aβ and suppress inflammation in neuronal tissue
Xanthohumol has been defined as a very important compound of hops and beer due to its positive effects as an antioxidant and neuroprotective described in some central papers
In this line,

Silicon
Silicon, in the form of silicic acid or orthosilicic acid, is mainly found in whole grains (e.g., cereals) and fiber-rich foods.
Therefore, due to its production ingredients, beer is one of the main silicon dietary source
Although the health benefits of silicon, with regard to skeletal and neurological function and status, have already been recognized [149], there is currently limited available information regarding the possible beneficial effects of silicon on neural toxicity.
In this regard, recent papers of our group (Table
Noremberg et al.
This finding is relevant because of oxidative stress, and increased LPO levels in cerebral tissue are major factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases
The reduction of TBARS levels by the administration of silicon strongly suggests the neuroprotective effect of this metal.
Silicon was also effective in reducing the LPO, since the formation of hydroxyaluminosilicates may reduce aluminum availability, leading to a decrease in ROS generation.
Therefore, silicon could be considered a protector against aluminum-associated neurological diseases

Effects of Beer on Aluminum Bioavailability
Silicon and silicic acid may decrease aluminum bioavailability by partially blocking its gastrointestinal tract uptake [152] and by impeding its reabsorption
According to Gillette Guyonnet et al.
These authors suggest the possible use of silicates as a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease, since both model tangles and precipitated β-pleated sheets of Aβ4 can be reversed to soluble forms by silicates.
Likewise, the same authors found that silica in drinking water might reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease
More than one decade ago, it was demonstrated that beer intake affected the kinetics of aluminum uptake and excretion.
A three-day shot-term study in male mice subjected to the conjoint administration of aluminum (450 µg/ml) and two doses of beer, one equivalent to moderate-low consumption in humans (0.5 L/d) and another equivalent to moderate-high consumption in humans (1 L/d), was performed
Following this study, a long-term test was formulated to substantiate the possible protective action of beer against chronic aluminum exposure and accumulation in brain tissue.
Results demonstrated that silicic acid and beer affected the kinetics of aluminum uptake and excretion, possibly through an interaction between aluminum and silicon in the digestive tract.
Moreover, silicic acid did not only reduce the aluminum gastrointestinal absorption but also increased the aluminum release and excretion from the body.
In fact, the aluminum group excreted significantly lower fecal aluminum than the aluminum-beer and aluminum-silicon groups (487.7 ± 70.8 µg/g feces vs. 581.0
± 92.6 and 665.9 ± 160.4,
respectively) [122].
Therefore, it was hypothesized that silicon in the form of silicic acid may lower aluminum bioavailability and hence should be considered an element that may afford protection against aluminum intoxication.
The dietary o-silicic acid supplement was efficient in lowering aluminum brain depots in the aluminum-silicon mice to the same values observed in the basal group.
Similarly, although not significantly, the administration of beer tended to decrease the aluminum content in the brain.
These results suggest that beer intake did not produce the same increase in brain silicon levels as the dietary silicon supplement did.
Nonetheless, based on these results, it must be suggested that silicon administration appears effective in preventing aluminum accumulation in mouse brain, as was previously reported by
Figure
Thus, white matter spongiosis but no neuronal necrosis was observed in the positive aluminum control mice (a).
Aluminum-dosed animals treated with silicon showed necrosis both in the cortex and in the cerebellum (b).
By contrast, the brains of the mouse that received conjoint administration of aluminum and beer exhibited necrosis of cortical neurons (c).
Although the results clearly suggest more advanced lesions in the aluminum-intoxicated mice, it was concluded that more detailed studies of longer duration should be further performed, to validate the pathologic repercussions found.
role by decreasing aluminum bioavailability.

As already commented on, the effectiveness of silicon could be attributed to its interaction with aluminum through the formation of nontoxic aluminosilicate complexes that decrease free aluminum availability.
A number of biological sites have been identified, in which silicon and aluminum are codeposited or co-localized.
Among them, the senile plaque cores in the cerebral cortex of patients As already commented on, the effectiveness of silicon could be attributed to its interaction with aluminum through the formation of nontoxic aluminosilicate complexes that decrease free aluminum availability.
A number of biological sites have been identified, in which silicon and aluminum are co-deposited or co-localized.
Among them, the senile plaque cores in the cerebral cortex of patients suffering from senile dementia/Alzheimer's type have been more deeply investigated.
High-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on the central regions of these plaques have shown that silicon and aluminum are present as an aluminosilicate species as a way to partially block aluminum toxicity
Plaque structures have also been observed in mentally normal elderly patients, and the use of dietary silicon supplements as a preventive measure for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested [155].

Effect of Beer on Brain Antioxidant and Inflammatory Status
Taking into account the relationships between aluminum exposure, oxidative stress, inflammation, and certain neurological disorders already commented on, our research group also carried out studies to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of beer itself and by means of its major components (silicon and hops) on the oxidative and inflammatory alterations induced by aluminum intoxication in mice.
Changes in gene expression of some antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory factors were evaluated in the brains of different mice groups that distinctly received aluminum plus beer, aluminum plus silicon or simply aluminum for 3 months
Results showed that inclusion of silicon in the diet in the form of beer or silicic acid reduces the harmful effects of increased cerebral peroxidation by lowering aluminum levels in the brain.
In addition, silicon, silicic acid or beer highly blocked the prooxidant and pro-inflammatory actions of aluminum by decreasing brain TBARS levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) expressions but increasing the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme expressions.
Thus, the changes on redox status induced by beer or silicon consumptions seem to be related with an adequate ROS production, giving rise to a correct reduced-oxidized glutathione (GSH-GSSG) balance.
These findings are relevant, as oxidative stress and increased lipid peroxidation in the brain are the major contributing factors for neurodegenerative disease development
The administration of silicic acid or beer reduced TBARS levels, strongly suggesting the neuroprotective properties of silicon.
Interestingly, brain gene expressions of Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, and CAT were positively correlated with one another, but all of them negatively with GPx gene expression, supporting the hypothesis that ingestion of silicon has beneficial effects against aluminum intoxication
The lower TNFα expression in the silicic acid and beer groups with respect to the aluminum group and the control group newly suggests the existence of a detoxification mechanism.
These results were suggested in previous studies to be related with a successful chelation of aluminum, followed by its mobilization and excretion from the body as previously discussed
In fact, hops, due to their high polyphenol content, have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects
Although results due to silicon administration were very relevant, the role of other compounds present in beer, as hops, some polyphenols, folic acid, melatonin, and alcohol, cannot be ruled out.
In fact, hops have been found to be a relevant source of resveratrol that could partially explain the improvement of the antioxidant status in beer-administrated mice
In addition, hops decrease production of TBARS and carbonyl groups in the elderly
Folic acid is responsible, through cystathionine-β synthase, for producing cysteine, a precursor of glutathione that exerts antioxidant properties.
Moreover, hyperhomocysteinemia-a condition related to low folic acid bioavailability-increased generation of free radicals [160], and several studies in humans have reported an inverse association between homocysteine and cognitive impairment or dementia
Another interesting beer compound is melatonin
Therefore, melatonin can directly act as a free radical scavenging and indirectly stimulating the role of some antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD, GPx, GR) which, in turn, will reduce the toxicity of radicals and their associated reactants
In addition, melatonin reduced Aβ-induced oxidative stress and the level of IL6 and IL1-β pro-inflammatory cytokines in in vivo studies

Effect of Beer on Metal Homeostasis in the Brain
Emerging data suggest that aluminum may heighten some events associated with neurodegenerative diseases by inducing mineral imbalance
According to Colomina and Peris-Sampedro
Maintaining transition metal homeostasis is known to be important in a wide variety of biological functions, such as antioxidant defense mechanisms.
Aiming to shed some light on the effect of aluminum on brain metal homeostasis, we evaluated in mice the effect of aluminum exposure on copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, silicon, zinc, and aluminum brain contents and the correlations between those metal levels and some antioxidant status and inflammation markers.
In addition, by means of statistical models, we elucidated potential mechanisms that will contribute to explaining the role of the brain metal content on brain toxicity
Aluminum nitrate exposition significantly increased silicon contents in mouse brains but decreased copper, manganese, and zinc levels.
Under aluminum nitrate exposition, beer or silicic acid significantly lowered aluminum and silicon levels and normalized those of copper, manganese, and zinc in the brain.
The nonsignificant effects found on iron can be partially explained, according to Colomina and Peris-Sampedro
A principal component study (PCA) performed considering mouse groups, brain metals, and brain oxidative/inflammatory profiles showed that the aluminum group was clearly separated from control animals, while aluminum-beer and aluminum-silicon were placed closer to control mice, suggesting a partial block of aluminum pro-oxidant effects.
On the other hand, pro-oxidant markers in the brain connected with the brain aluminum content and, to a lesser extent, with that of silicon.
By contrast, zinc and copper brain levels were closer to the antioxidants' enzyme activities (Figure
Thus, it can be highlighted that the conjoint administration of aluminum nitrate and silicic acid or beer partially blocked the metal disbalance induced by aluminum nitrate and reversed the inflammatory and oxidant/antioxidant status of the mouse's brain.
Such a blocking effect joined to the impact of silicic acid/beer on aluminum nitrate absorption justifies the importance of adjusting dietary silicon levels to aluminum intake.

Effect of Non-Alcoholic Beer, Silicon, and Hops on Brain Damage and Behavioral Changes Induced by Aluminum
The previous results clearly show the benefits of beer consumption, so it would be appropriate to recommend it as a way to alleviate the deleterious effects of aluminum exposure on the brain.
However, regular beer should not be recommended to some population sectors (e.g., pregnant women, metabolic syndrome patients, non-alcoholic fatty liver patients) due to its alcohol content
Therefore, our research group conducted a new study on the capacity of non-alcoholic beer (NA-beer) and its components (silicon and hops) to enhance brain antioxidant and inflammatory status, which in turn would help with improving brain functions, improving the impaired learning ability, and motility caused by aluminum intoxication.
In addition, the in vitro antioxidant capacity and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity of NA-beer and its two main ingredients, silicon and hops, were evaluated
Results of that study clearly show that the incorporation of aluminum nitrate plus NA-beer or its hops and silicon components significantly reduced the negative effects caused by aluminum nitrate administration on the behavior of rats and the brain's inflammatory and antioxidant markers.
The behavior assessment was performed according to a standard battery test.
In the hole-board task, we evaluated curiosity, immobility time, grooming frequency, and the defecation index.
Grooming was interpreted as a way to release tension, defecation rate indicated the emotive grade as an intestinal tonus and peristalsis increase, and immobility was related to transitory hyperactivity
The pain threshold was evaluated throughout the hot plate test
These tendencies were clearly demonstrated after testing behavior results by the principal components analysis for categorical data (CATPCA) in order to identify patterns and highlight relationships and to observe group distribution differences (optimum group scaling was: 1, control group; 2, aluminum nitrate-treated group; 3, aluminum nitrate plus non-alcoholic beer; 4, aluminum nitrate plus hops extract; 5, aluminum nitrate plus silicon).
On the basis of a stability study, two major components were found that explained 73.3% of total data variance (43.2% for the first one and 31.1% for the second one (Figure
Two subscales, positive and negative, for each component, explaining the contribution to the model, were drawn.
For the first dimension, forced swimming and group scaling were the variables that most negatively contributed, while immobility time at forced swimming, immobility, and reaction time at the hot plate test, the variables that most positively contributed to the model.
For the second dimension, rearing, curiosity, and group scaling most negatively contributed, while grooming, fecal index, and immobility most positively contributed to the model.
The ellipses drawn help to identify data for the different experimental groups in comparison to their control counterpart and aluminum groups.
The first dimension separates aluminum behavioral data from those of aluminum + silicon and aluminum + NA-beer.
The second dimension separates the behavioral data of the aluminum group from those of the control group.
Results also suggest a new role for NA-beer and its components, as the administration of NA-beer, hops, and silicon together with aluminum nitrate was effective in preventing the detrimental effect of this metal on memory decline.
This preventive effect was also clearly shown in the CATPCA test evaluating behavior as the aluminum group data were sharply separated from the control and all treated groups.
In addition, some related measurements (e.g., hot plate time reaction and fecal index changes) contributed similarly to the multivariate model applied, supporting the validity of the battery test performed in the present study.
According to relevant research, aluminum interacts with the cholinergic system, acting as a cholinotoxin.
The intensification of inflammation and the interference with cholinergic projection functions may represent the way by which it contributes to pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease, leading to learning and memory deficits [169] and explaining the negative effects on curiosity, immobility time, grooming frequency, defecation rate, and forced swimming on aluminum intoxicated rats observed in our study.
The in vivo test showed that behavioral improvements observed after the administration of NA-beer and its components in this study appear to be clearly associated with the in vitro results obtained from AChE and buthylcholinesterase (BChE) by our research group testing silicon in human neuroblastoma cells
In fact, Jacqmin-Gadda et al.
Noremberg et al.
An increase of AChE activity was observed in the aluminum-treated group in the cerebellum, whereas a decrease of this enzyme activity was observed in the cortex and hippocampus in the aluminum and aluminum + silicon groups.
In line with the González-Muñoz et al.
Noremberg et al.
As previously commented on, although aluminum is not a transition metal and therefore cannot initiate peroxidation, aluminum induces alteration in brain metal homeostasis
High TBARS values and alteration in the antioxidant enzyme activity and expression observed in the brains of the aluminum group corroborate the pro-oxidant effects of aluminum and suggest the relative failure of antioxidant mechanisms.
Martínez et al.
This would explain the memory impairment and neurotoxicity.

Inhibition of TBARS by administration of aluminum + silicon or aluminum + NA-beer strongly suggests the neuroprotective properties of silicon and beer compounds against aluminum intoxication.
According to Noremberg et al.
Figure
Aluminum intoxication significantly increased the SOD expression as a way to eliminate the produced superoxide ion, while due to the lower GR activity and expression and the higher GPx activity, GSH decreased.
The conjoint administration of aluminum NA-beer, silicon, and hops displays similar profiles for antioxidant enzyme activity and expressions.
NA-beer, hops extract, and silicon treatment appear to prevent aluminum-induced augmented lipid peroxidation and changes in GSH, GSSG, and redox index levels [123], probably by contributing both with antioxidants (e.g., phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins) (Tables
In addition, the conjoint administration of aluminum with hops, silicon or beer affected the inflammatory status in a quite similar manner.
The differences observed between the battery test for behavior and antioxidant and inflammatory status clearly indicate the complexity of the effects tested and suggest the interaction of treatments on neurotransmitter changes (e.g., acetylcholine).
Thus, hops clearly differentiate from beer and silicon at the behavior test with no differences with respect to the aluminum group, while exerting similar antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions as silicon and Na-beer.

Conclusions
Taking into account all previous discussed results, we can reach the following conclusions:
• In vitro and in vivo models are plausible tools to study brain mechanisms related to changes in behavior, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia.
• Aluminum induces several mechanisms engaged to brain damage and behavioral disturbances, through mechanisms that mainly involve apoptosis, tau phosphorylation, Aβ accumulation, ROS formation, necrosis of neuronal cells, regulation of metal imbalance, and changes in the antioxidant defense system.
• The conjoint addition of aluminum and beer, or its ingredients and compounds, proved that they can partially block the negative effects of neurodegeneration or neurotoxics, such as aluminum, in several cell, rodent, and human models.

•
Due to its alcohol content, regular beer consumption can be non-adequate for some risk-group populations (pregnancy, children, people affected by liver diseases), and the consumption of non-alcoholic beer is highly recommended instead of regular beers.

•
Given the results observed by our groups and others, dementia or the pathognomic factors can be blocked by promoting increased levels of silicon consumption in aluminum-intoxicated patients.

•
As silicon is "attracted by" the presence of aluminum at the intestine and brain, among other body places, strategies should be formulated to adjust silicon consumption to aluminum exposure and to increase the brain uptake of silicon.
In summary, regular beer consumption could constitute a non-invasive preventive measure for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, since it is effective in reducing the aluminum body load, as well as in alleviating the mineral homeostasis imbalance in the brain and the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects induced by that metal.
However, regular beer, due to its alcohol content, might not be adequate for consumption in all human beings.
Thus, the study of non-alcoholic beer properties and their application as a preventive tool for degenerative disease is highly demanded.

Future Remarks
Future studies should be focused on analyzing how the presence of different levels of silicon, hops, polyphenols, melatonin in beer, and their interactions affect the metabolizing capability of both alcohol-metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes.
In addition, the bioavailability of silicon differs depending on its food origin and chemical state
Taking into account the ample beer consumption in the world and the increased prevalence of dementia, future investigation should be addressed at understanding the intimate mechanisms implicated in different alteration pathways leading to dementia and the most powerful mechanisms by which beer could slow down the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
Early markers (BDNF, pancreatic amyloid, Nrf2, receptor of advanced glycosylation end products-RAGE) should be tested to improve prevention and delete or avoid the negative consequences of dementia in animal models and even in human beings with a special study of the interaction of Aβ with glial cells.
The role of beer and its compounds on these earlier markers should be investigated.
The most beneficial compounds of beer should be concentrated and their bioavailability improved while the theoretical negative compounds deleted to obtain a functional beer capable of slowing down the dementia progression in animal models and human populations.
Nutrigenomic studies should be performed and their results tested and studied in ample gen spectrum microchips.
Genes related with carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms and adipogenesis (e.g., PPARγ), mitochondrogenesis, and autophagy will be researched.
As some dietary compounds and lifestyle are implicated in the expression of BDNF [172], the role of beer and their compounds in this neurotrophic factor will also be studied.
As ethanol differently affects people depending on its metabolization rate and that of acethaldehyde
In addition, differences in response to beer and beer compounds will be tested according to GWAS and EGWAS
As recent studies have suggested a potential link between intestinal microflora composition and function and brain health
The benefits of one-a-day alcoholic beer, low alcohol content, and non-alcoholic beer versus abstention in an ample range of ages both in male and female health or differently affected by different dementia degrees or by degenerative diseases having Alzheimer's disease or dementia as comorbidity (e.g., diabetes) should be tested in long-term studies.

[100].
Abuznait et al. [101] proposed that the Mediterranean diet induces an increase of neurotrophic factors related to neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and elimination of Aβ from the brain.
The positive Mediterranean diet effects on the pathogenesis of vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease have largely been linked to the reduction of oxidative stress, through the consumption of abundant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., polyphenols) which, in turn, may alter the expression of inflammatory markers.
Thus, supplemental foods such as extra virgin olive oil and nuts, particularly rich in phenolic compounds [102], may counteract oxidative processes in the brain by reducing, in turn, neurodegeneration.
Other additional mechanisms attributed to polyphenols, such as cerebrovascular blood flow improvement, BDNF synthesis enhancement, neuronal signaling modulation, and neurogenesis stimulation should ameliorate neurologic health [103].
Nonetheless, the presence of other foods (such as fish rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) regularly found in the Mediterranean diet are also implicated in the reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia of people showing high adherence to this diet.
Light to moderate alcohol use may be associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease [104].

Figure 5
Figure 5 shows some relevant insights of a mouse brain intoxicated with aluminum [122].
Thus, white matter spongiosis but no neuronal necrosis was observed in the positive aluminum control mice (a).
Aluminum-dosed animals treated with silicon showed necrosis both in the cortex and in the cerebellum (b).
By contrast, the brains of the mouse that received conjoint administration of aluminum and beer exhibited necrosis of cortical neurons (c).
Although the results clearly suggest more advanced lesions in the aluminum-intoxicated mice, it was concluded that more detailed studies of longer duration should be further performed, to validate the pathologic repercussions found.
