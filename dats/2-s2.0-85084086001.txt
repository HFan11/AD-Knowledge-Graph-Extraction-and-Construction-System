Study of Caspase 8 Inhibition for the Management of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and usually manifests as diminished episodic memory and cognitive functions.
Caspases are crucial mediators of neuronal death in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and caspase 8 is considered a major therapeutic target in the context of AD.
In the present study, we performed a virtual screening of 200 natural compounds by molecular docking with respect to their abilities to bind with caspase 8.
Among them, rutaecarpine was found to have the highest (negative) binding energy (-6.5 kcal/mol) and was further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis.
Caspase 8 was determined to interact with rutaecarpine through five amino acid residues, specifically Thr337, Lys353, Val354, Phe355, and Phe356, and two hydrogen bonds (ligand: H35-A: LYS353:O and A:PHE355: N-ligand: N5).
Furthermore, a 50 ns MD simulation was conducted to optimize the interaction, to predict complex flexibility, and to investigate the stability of the caspase 8-rutaecarpine complex, which appeared to be quite stable.
The obtained results propose that rutaecarpine could be a lead compound that bears remarkable anti-Alzheimer's potential against caspase 8.

Introduction
The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to increase in parallel with aging, but no remedies have yet been developed that delay or inhibit AD-induced neurodegeneration
The available evidence shows that AD is the result of the combined effects of environmental, genomic, epigenomic, and metabolic variables
AD is the most common form of dementia and causes deficiencies in language and visuospatial skills, which are frequently accompanied by behavioral issues such as aggressiveness, apathy, and depression.
It has been reported that genetics contributes around 70% to the risk of AD
Furthermore, it has been estimated approximately 47 million people live with dementia, and it is predicted that this figure will more than treble by 2050.
The prevention of AD needs a timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management
The formation of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles associated with the hyperphosphorylation of τ-protein in the cortical and limbic portions of the human brain underlie the pathogenesis of AD
The disease also increases the activities of acetylcholinesterases, which contribute to cholinergic system function, and AD-associated dementia is known to involve extreme devastation of and complications in the cholinergic system
Caspase activation is a significant step in the apoptotic pathway and prompts the proteolytic cleavage of proteins in neurons.
Previously, it was believed that the classical hallmarks of AD, i.e., plaques and tangles, occur individually and do not involve caspase activation.
However, recent findings indicate that tangles, plaques, and caspase activation contribute in concert to the pathogenesis of AD, and caspase-cleaved tau may initiate or promote the formation of tau tangles
Caspase 8 is a large molecule known to participate in AD that is prompted by Aβ 1-40 to induce apoptosis.
Caspase 8 shows a significant role in causing AD by cleaving amyloid precursor proteins during apoptosis, leading to the increased formation of the amyloid-beta peptide
Natural neuroprotective compounds have been shown to provide promising outcomes when used to treat neurodegenerative diseases like AD and to have negligible side effects
Rutaecarpine is a component of the alkaloid extract of the Chinese medicine Evodia, which has been reported to improve myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.
Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of rutaecarpine to inhibit caspase 8 by a molecular docking study and MD simulation with the aim of identifying a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.

Results
In the present study, we retrieved a list of natural compounds from the ZINC database (
using filters such as "natural product", "non-fda", and "in-stock", and these were subsequently filtered with the Lipinski rule of five; a total of 200 compounds were selected for molecular docking studies against caspase 8, and it was found that rutaecarpine (ZINC898237) bound most strongly with caspase 8, which was further validated by MD simulations.
Our findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of rutaecarpine require further study.
The docking studies showed human caspase 8 interacts with rutaecarpine through five amino acid residues, namely Thr337, Lys353, Val354, Phe355, and Phe356 (Figure

Discussion
Numerous preclinical/clinical studies have shown natural products could make valuable contributions to the treatment of AD
Rutaecarpine was the first natural alkaloid used to treat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and has been suggested for the treatment of vascular dementia
Furthermore, molecular docking has been widely used to predict the bindings of small molecules and drugs to their protein targets and to predict their binding affinities and activities
MD simulation is used to obtain binding mode information between receptors and ligands
Here, we used huperzine A and quercetin as control molecules to validate receptor-ligand interactions.
In previous studies, huperzine A appeared to have positive effects on the improvement of cognitive function and curing of AD
The free energies of human caspase 8 binding with huperzine A and quercetin have been reported as -4.28 kcal/mol and -4.89 kcal/mol, respectively
In the present study, two amino acid residues, LYS353 and PHE355, of caspase 8, that is, ligand: H35-A: LYS353:O and A:PHE355: N-ligand: N5 were found to be involved in H-bond formation with rutaecarpine, with H-bond distances of 1.60045 and 3.09333 Å, respectively.
The donor, H35 of rutaecarpine, interacted with the O of LYS353, whereas the nitrogen of PHE355 interacted with acceptor N5 of rutaecarpine.
It has been reported that hydrogen bonds formed among ligands and receptors more often contribute to the stability of the protein-ligand complex
One amino acid residue of caspase 8 (Val354) was found to interact hydrophobically with rutaecarpine, whereas Phe355 was involved in Pi-Pi and cation-Pi interactions.
Van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and desolvation energy components contributed -6.44 kcal/mol to rutaecarpine and caspase 8 binding, and the electrostatic contribution was -0.04 kcal/mol.
The total interacting surface area of the caspase 8-rutaecarpine complex was 485.76 Å 2 .
The docked complex was subjected to MD simulation to confirm the stability of the rutaecarpine-to-caspase 8 interaction because the technique is known to usefully simulate bench-based experimental results
The timedependences of the MD trajectories were examined using the RMSD of complex and Rg of all backbone atoms
RMSF is an important parameter that yields data about the structural adaptability of Cα atoms of every residue in the system
The Rg is used to assess the overall dimensions and stabilities of the enzyme-ligand complex and is a function of the mass-weighted RMS distances of atoms from the center of mass
The BOILED-Egg plot generated by SwissADME graphically represents rutaecarpine in Figure
It can be effectively concluded from the outcome that rutaecarpine crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (yellow region).
Daina and Zoete (2016) reported that ponatinib accurately lies inside the white ellipse but inside the BOILED-Egg′s yolk, too.
This agrees with experimental data suggesting that ponatinib crosses the BBB

Molecular Docking Study
Rutaecarpine was subjected to molecular docking analysis with caspase 8 using the "Autodock 4.2" standalone molecular docking suite
Gasteiger charges types were assigned for the compound, and the MMFF94 force field was applied for energy minimization.
Non-polar hydrogen atoms and rotatable bonds were defined, and the docking estimations were performed on protein models.
Hydrogen atoms, Kollman charges, and solvation factors were incorporated by the AutoDock tools.
A box of 60 × 60 × 60 Å was formed using the Autogrid program.
Docking simulations were accomplished by Lamarckian genetic calculations.
The docking experiment involved 50 unique runs over 2,500,000 energy evaluations, with other default parameters.
The best run coordinates of the compound and enzymes were visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer.

BOILED-Egg Plot
The simplified molecular-input line-entry specification notation was entered into the online Swiss ADME web tool for the prediction of gastrointestinal absorption and brain penetration.
These predictions were done utilizing the BOILED-Egg (Brain or Intestinal Estimated permeation) method.
This method is principally founded on two parameters: (1) the lipophilicity of the compounds, assessed from the partition-coefficient (P) by a LogP value determined by the Wildman-Crippen method (WLogP); and (2) their polarity, dictated by a calculated topological polar surface area (tPSA) value
It can be easily studied on the basis of the yellow-shaded yolk representing the physiochemical space for highly probable BBB penetration and the white space representing the physiochemical space for HIA absorption.
Another parameter associated with this study is the P-gp active efflux pump as it transports the lipophilic drug out of the brain capillary endothelial cells that form the BBB

MD Simulation Study
MD simulation was performed using GROMACS 5.1.4
to analyze the stability and flexibility of the caspase 8-rutaecarpine complex
The ProDRG server was used to prepare rutaecarpine topology files
The complex was solvated in a cubic box of volume 377.187 nm 3 .
The steepest descent algorithm for 50,000 steps with a cut-off value of 1000 kJ•mol -1 was applied for energy minimization.
In addition, the LINCS algorithm
NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) and NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) phases of the equilibration were executed for 100 ps.

MD simulation was conducted for 50 ns.
The outcomes such as the RMSD, RMSF, and Rg of the caspase 8-rutaecarpine complex were analyzed according to the time-dependent behaviors of MD trajectories.

In this study, the binding between the natural compound rutaecarpine and human caspase 8 was studied using a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods.
Hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were found to play important roles in caspase 8-rutaecarpine complex formation.
The binding energy and inhibition constant of the caspase 8-rutaecarpine complex were found to be -6.13
kcal/mol and 75.68 µmol, respectively.
In addition, simulation analysis was performed to better understand backbone fluctuations and complex stability using RMSD and RMSF values.
