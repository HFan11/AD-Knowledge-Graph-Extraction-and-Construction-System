Natural Marine and Terrestrial Compounds as Modulators of Matrix Metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in Alzheimer’s Disease
Several studies have reported neuroprotective effects by natural products.
A wide range of natural compounds have been investigated, and some of these may play a beneficial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zincdependent endopeptidases, have been implicated in AD.
In particular, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are able to trigger several neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways.
In this review, we summarize and discuss existing literature on natural marine and terrestrial compounds, as well as their ability to modulate MMP-2 and MMP-9, and we evaluate their potential as therapeutic compounds for neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease.

Introduction
Most neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by an incurable loss of neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to impaired movement and/or mental functioning.
In 2019, an estimated 50 million individuals were suffering from dementia worldwide, and this number is projected to increase to 152 million cases by 2050.
The worldwide cost of dementia exceeds one trillion dollars per year and is set to double by 2030
While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, other neurodegenerative disorders resulting in cognitive defects include vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, mixed dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.
Furthermore, neurodegenerative diseases affecting the motor system include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and spinocerebellar ataxias
Despite the high burden of these pathologies, current therapies mostly manage symptoms but do not prevent progressive deterioration
Brain tissue from patients with AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins
The most known molecular pathway in AD is the generation of Aβ peptides, which are released after the consecutive cleavage of membrane-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) by α and γ-secretases (a process referred to as the amyloidogenic pathway; Figure
After release, Aβ peptides induce the formation of protein aggregates.
While the main component is Aβ, up to 488 other proteins that also influence the process of aggregation have been detected
For example, a cross-reaction with apolipoprotein A1, cystatin C, or transthyretin inhibits amyloid formation
However, the formation of pathogenic Aβ peptides can be avoided through the cleavage of APP by α-secretase and the release of soluble APPα (sAPPα) (a process referred to as the non-amyloidogenic pathway; Figure
Though tau and Aβ aggregates are hallmarks of AD

One family of proteins that has gained attention in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
MMPs are endopeptidases that are able to modify a broad range of proteins with key functions in the extracellular and pericellular environment (discussed in Section 1.1.).
MMPs have been studied as therapeutic targets for several pathologies, in particular cancer.
However, early clinical trials in which broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors were used for the treatment of cancer failed due to off-target effects.
Since then, selectivity has become one of the principal aspects of MMP inhibitor design.
In addition, various molecules acting against two or more MMPs have recently been investigated, suggesting that carefully selected multitarget approaches also represent a promising strategy for targeting MMPs
Interesting, both the beneficial and detrimental functions of MMPs in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation have been described
For example, MMPs cleave myelin basic protein (MBP), thereby contributing to the demyelination of neurons and neurodegeneration.
In contrast, several MMPs are able to degrade Aβ aggregates

Though this suggests a potential role for MMPs in aggregate clearance, it remains to be seen whether this is clinically significant.
Nevertheless, given the many pathological functions of MMPs, they remain considered as potential targets for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
An overview of the roles of MMPs in neuropathology and discussion on their suitability as targets in AD is given in Section 1.2.2.

Introduction to MMPs
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), also called matrixins, are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases
MMPs have a modular domain structure and share a similar catalytic domain and zinc-binding domain, together forming the active site for substrate catalysis (Figure
MMPs are secreted by cells such as inactive pro-enzymes (proMMPs) that require the proteolytic removal (e.g., by other proteases) or chemical modification (e.g., by reactive oxygen species) of a self-inhibitory prodomain in order to become catalytically active proteases
The prodomain, catalytic domain, and zinc-binding domain form the structural basis of all MMPs.
Several MMPs also share a hemopexin domain that is involved in binding to substrates
MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinase A and gelatinase B) both have three fibronectin repeats that give them the ability to bind large substrates such as collagens and to efficiently cleave gelatins
In addition, MMP-9 has a unique linker sequence (64 amino acids) that connects the active site to the hemopexin domain and is rich in O-glycans; hence, it is named the O-glycosylated domain.
This domain is indispensable for MMP-9 functions including cell migration
Furthermore, this domain allows MMP-9 to form higher order multimers that are differentially regulated by natural MMP inhibitors than MMP-9 monomers
There are several MMPs that are bound to the cell surface through a membrane anchoring domain such as a transmembrane domain or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, thereby executing cell-surface associated functions
Finally, MMP-23 is an atypical MMP, having a transmembrane domain attached to the N-terminus and an immunoglobulin-like domain and cysteine-rich domain attached to the C-terminus
MMPs are mainly known for their ability to cleave components of the extracellular matrix (ECM); hence, their original nomenclature was based on substrate specificity, e.g., collagenases, gelatinases, and matrilysins.
The cleavage of ECM components by MMPs contributes to processes such as tissue remodeling, cell migration, and the release of growth factors from the ECM
However, many other (even intracellular
For example, the nuclear localization of MMP-2 was reported in cigarette smoke-exposed endothelial cells and associated with cell apoptosis
MMP-12 is transported to the nucleus, where it binds to the NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha NFKBIA promoter and mediates NFKBIA transcription, leading to Interferonα secretion and protection against viral infections
Finally, functions unrelated to the proteolytic actions of MMPs have also been found.
These effects mainly rely on the cell-surface association of MMPs and the subsequent activation of signal transduction pathways, e.g., by binding of cell surface receptors such as CD44 and integrins

MMPs in Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation
A common feature of several neurodegenerative disorders is the presence and dispersal of anomalous protein aggregates throughout the brain.
For example, the formation of amyloid fibrils and Aβ peptide aggregates in AD, tau tangles in tauopathies and αsynuclein aggregates in PD.
The formation of these anomalies is associated with neurotoxicity and the progressive loss of neurons.
As an additional factor, innate immune mechanisms are also implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
The transitioning of the innate immune response into chronic inflammation results in the proliferation of glial cells (gliosis) and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines
For a comprehensive overview of the actions of all MMPs in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, we refer the reader to several recent reviews
In this manuscript, we focus on the actions of the two gelatinases-MMP-2 and MMP-9.

Localization and Origin of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the Nervous System
Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 can be expressed by cells of the nervous system.
While expression of MMP-9 is most often induced, MMP-2 is more constitutively present and less influenced by damaging factors
The basal expression of MMP-9 in healthy brain tissue is low
The disease-or damage-mediated induction of MMP-9 is found in the endothelial cells of cerebral vasculature

The basal expression of MMP-9 in healthy brain tissue is low
The disease-or damage-mediated induction of MMP-9 is found in the endothelial cells of cerebral vasculature
In patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), MMP-9 is expressed at the rim of plaques in chronic active lesions, suggestive for the expression of MMP-9 by activated microglia
Furthermore, all forms of MMP-9 (monomers, multimers, and charge variants) are increased in serum from patients with MS
Interestingly, in a rat model for HD, MMP-9 immunoreactivity was found in the nuclei of the neurons of a healthy rat striatum
In a mouse model for peripheral nerve injury, MMP-2 was found to be constitutively present in nerve tissue
However, in a mouse model for AD, MMP-2 was also increased in astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques
Infiltrating immune cells are a second source of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are the first cells to arrive in damaged tissue and PMN-derived MMPs have neurotoxic activity
PMN infiltration is followed by monocyte infiltration, and tissue-differentiated monocytes secrete higher levels of MMP-9 compared undifferentiated monocytes, thereby contributing to neurotoxicity
In animal models for peripheral nerve injury and spinal cord injury, MMP-9 is associated with infiltrating macrophages
In HIV-induced dementia, proMMP-2 is secreted by HIV-infected macrophages
In conclusion, there are several origins of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CNS pathology; both resident and infiltrating immune cells are able to supply these proteases or induce their production, e.g., upon stimulation with proinflammatory molecules.

Mechanisms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CNS Pathology
MMPs have a potential role in the turnover of protein aggregates (Figure
Several MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9, are able to cleave Aβ monomers and oligomers, but MMP-9 is unique in its ability to also cleave Aβ fibrils and clear plaques from amyloidladen brains.
For a detailed overview of MMP cleavage sites on APP, the reader is referred to the review manuscript by Cauwe et al.
A recent overview of APP processing by MMPs is also available in the review manuscript by Zipfel et al.
Though mainly relying on in vitro studies, ex vivo studies, and steady state mouse models, a positive cross-interaction between Aβ, MMP-2, and MMP-9 has been suggested
Moreover, several studies have shown that Aβ can also induce MMP-9 expression and activity in vitro, e.g., in astrocytes
Hence, Aβ-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression might also enhance MMP-associated neurotoxicity and outweigh the Aβ-clearing effect.
Interestingly, tau, the aggregating protein associated with tauopathies, including AD, is also an MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 substrate.
However, proteolysis by MMP-9, not MMP-3, induces tau oligomer formation
MMP-2 and MMP-9 can cleave several soluble factors such as chemokines and growth factors, thereby altering their functional properties
Several MMPs (including MMP-2 and MMP-9) are able to cleave C-X-C motif chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) stromal cellderived factor-1 (SDF-1), thereby either degrading it or converting it to a neurotoxic protein that activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Figure
In HIV-associated neurodegeneration, proMMP-2 is secreted by HIV-infected macrophages, and after activation by neuronal MMP-14/ membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP, MMP-2 converts astrocyte-derived SDF-1 into neurotoxic SDF-1 (5-67)
Another crucial substrate of MMPs is MBP (Figure
Many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that MMPs promote demyelination by degrading MBP, a major constituent of myelin sheets supporting neuronal signals
MMPs also have a fundamental role in leukocyte migration (Figure
During neuroinflammation, leukocytes migrate from the circulation into the CNS.
This process requires their migration through a layer of vascular endothelial cells, two layers of basement membranes (the endothelial basement membrane and the parenchymal basement membrane), and a layer of astrocytes, together forming the blood brain barrier (BBB)
Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are important players in this process.
In mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for CNS inflammation, leukocytes were found to use MMP-2 and MMP-9 to migrate through the parenchymal basement membrane, specifically through the cleavage of dystroglycan, a transmembrane receptor that connects astrocyte endfeet with parenchymal basement membrane BM
For a detailed overview on the roles of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in neuroinflammation, we refer the reader to a recent review by Hannocks et al.

For a detailed view on the roles of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in neuroinflammation, we refer the reade recent review by Hannocks et al.
Several models for neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animals defi Several models for neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in animals deficient in MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 have been used to show beneficial effects on disease progression and outcome.
Upon spinal cord injury, MMP-9-knockout (KO) mice have less disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and improved locomotor recovery
The deletion of the MMP-9 gene protects nerve fibers from demyelination and reduces neuropathic pain after injury
While MMP-9 KO mice are protected in traumatic brain injury
The genetic ablation of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 in mice results in resistance to EAE by inhibiting dystroglycan cleavage and preventing leukocyte infiltration
Finally, the beneficial effects of MMP inhibitors (minocycline, simvastatin, and GM6001) have been described in a model for cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Overall, these studies justify the inhibition of MMP-2/-9 in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD and highlight the potential of new inhibitory compounds.

Natural Products from Marine Source That Modulate MMP-2 and/or MMP-9
Marine organisms such as sponges, macroalgae, microalgae, and bacteria are considered effective biological sources of new bioactive drugs.
These organisms are usually rich in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals that are secreted to survive in the hostile environment where they live.
The bioactive molecules are metabolites such as small chemical molecules, as well as short peptides and enzymes.
One critical point associated with marine compounds is that only limited amounts are produced by the natural source.
In addition, their chemical structures are often too complex to be synthetized in vitro.
In recent years, several products with anti-MMP activity have been identified from marine sources.
Most investigations have been focused on their effect on MMPs during inflammatory diseases and/or cancer.
Due to the relevance of MMPs (especially MMP-2 and MMP-9) in neurodegenerative diseases, marine products could also be useful for the inhibition of MMPs in AD
In the following paragraphs, several natural MMP modulators of marine origin are reported.

This problem stems from the fact that several of the standard methods to evaluate MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and activity are prone to misinterpretation (as discussed in more detail by
In this review manuscript, a clear distinction between these different levels of regulation was made based on the methodology used in each of the discussed manuscripts.

Protein and Peptides
C-phycocyanin (C-PC) is a deep blue colored pigment protein that can be isolated and purified from several seaweeds.
C-PC is largely found in Spirulina, a microalgae used in many countries as dietary supplement and whose nutritional benefits have been welldescribed
The structure of C-PC is characterized by a heterodimeric monomer (αβ) formed by the α and β subunits.
Usually, the αβ monomers of C-PC further polymerize into higher order multimers; (αβ) n n = 1 ~6
C-PC has several biological activities such as improving wound healing, antioxidant activity, pro-apoptotic effects, and antitumor activity
The beneficial effects of C-PC have also been observed in various models for degenerative diseases such as PD, MS and ALS
Recently, C-PC was reported as an inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
In a vasculogenic mimicry assay with breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231 cell line), treatment with C-PC resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of vascular channels formed compared to a control.
A real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) analysis recorded a decrease in the mRNA levels of both vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) and MMP-9, two key regulators of cancer-associated angiogenesis
In a 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colon cancer rat model, treatment with piroxicam and C-PC resulted in a lower tumor expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 compared to a control.
Both pro-and activated forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were reduced
In the HepG2 cell line (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), C-PC could also inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of both investigated MMPs
Moreover, it has been reported that C-PC might cross the BBB in a model for tributyltin chloride (TBTC)-induced neurotoxicity, adding to its neuroprotective effects and making C-PC a potential drug candidate in neurodegenerative diseases

Several studies have found that abalone is a source of nutraceuticals with antimicrobial, anti-oxidant, anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities
The digestion of abalone intestine with an in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) digestion system resulted in the identification of two peptides with anti-MMP-2 and anti-MMP-9 activity in human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080 cells) (Table
AOP (Ala-Glu-Leu-Pro-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gly) was first characterized in 2013 by Nguyen et al.
In addition to inhibitory activity against MMPs, the AATP peptide also reduces the level of mRNA expression of both gelatinases.
Other peptides were also identified from boiled abalone such as ATPGDEG (Ala-Thr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Glu-Gly) and BABP (Glu-Met-Asp-Glu-Ala-Gln-Asp-Gly-Asp-Pro-Lys) (Table
In a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT cells), treatment with ATPGDEG resulted in a reduction of MMP-9 secretion.
Moreover, molecular docking analysis suggested that ATPGDEG interacts with the MMP-9 active site, thereby blocking the catalytic activity
The treatment of HT1080 cells with BABP also resulted in reduced levels of MMP-9 but not of MMP-2.
BABP was able to suppress both MMP-9 protein levels (as determined by gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis) and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner
Despite several studies, it is still not fully known how these peptides interact with MMPs.
One hypothesis is that the amino acids Glu, Asp, Pro, and Lys could be involved
The LSGYGP (Leu-Ser-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Pro), a peptide isolated from tilapia fish skin gelatin hydrolysates (TGHs) (Table
It has been suggested that TGHs could protect mouse skin collagen fibers against UV irradiation damage.
In UVB-stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), LSGYGP significantly decreased the levels of MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner.
Furthermore, after using molecular modeling simulation, it was suggested that LSGYGP can enter into the catalytic site of MMP-9, thereby inhibiting its proteolytic activity
The Mere Meretrix 15 kDa polypeptide (Mere15) peptide was isolated from Meretrix meretrix Linnaeus, a mollusk used in traditional Chinese medicine as an anticancer molecule (Table
In human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, Mere15 downregulated the secretion of proteins and the expression of the mRNA of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
Moreover, MMP-9 expression was lower than that of MMP-2, suggesting that MMP-9 is more sensitive to Mere15 inhibition

Compounds
Diazepinomicin (BU-4664L) is a terpenoid firstly identified in the extract of marine Micromonospora sp.
BU-4664L has mainly been studied for its anti-invasive and antimigratory effects on cancer cells.
In murine colon 26-L5 carcinoma cells, BU-4664L inhibited the proteolytic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with IC 50 values of 0.46 and 0.60 µg/mL, respectively (Table
Furthermore, it was confirmed that BU-4664L is able to influence both extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration
In 2008, a Phase II clinical trial with BU-4664L was started in patients affected by glioblastoma.
Unfortunately, due to a lack of efficacy, the trail failed.
Nevertheless, BU-4664L is a bioactive, farnesylated, dibenzodiazepinone alkaloid that is able to cross the BBB and provide a potential scaffold for further optimization and for investigation in the study of the relationship between AD and MMPs.
Ageladine A, isolated from the extract of the marine sponge Agelas nakamurai, possesses antiangiogenic activity.
An in vitro study on isolated enzymes showed that ageladine A inhibits both MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteolytic activity (Table
Since several MMP inhibitors exhibit their inhibitory activity by interaction with the Zn +2 -ion of the catalytic domain (chelation), the chelation power of ageladine A was investigated but could not be established.
Therefore, ageladine A is likely to inhibit through a yet-to-be-determined mechanism
Aeroplysinin-1 is a brominated antibiotic secreted by Aplysina aerophoba sponges as a chemical defense response triggered by tissue injury.
Aeroplysinin-1 is thought to have anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic actions.
A study conducted in different human endothelial cell lines reported a decrease of MMP-2 expression
Lemnalol (Table
Though immunohistochemical analysis, it was shown that lemnalol decreases the infiltration and degranulation of MCs, and it was suggested that this effect is partially related to reduced expression of MMP-9 [100].
11-Epi-sinularoide acetate (11-epi-SA) was isolated from the soft coral Sinularia flexibilis (Table
In hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HA22T cells), 11-epi-SA was found to inhibit cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner.
These activities remained at low, non-toxic doses (<7.98 µM) and also reduced the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, suggesting that the effect could be associated with the modulation of MMPs or their endogenous inhibitors
Recently, 11-epi-SA was also studied in a human bladder cancer cell line (TSGH-8301 cells), again showing a relevant effect against cell migration and invasion.
Similarly, these effects were associated with decreased levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein secretion
Considering the reported results in cancer models, 11-epi-SA might also be a promising candidate for further development as a new modulator of MMPs in other pathologies such as AD.
Dihydroaustrasulfone alcohol (DA), isolated from marine coral, has antioxidant and anti-cancer activity (Table
Furthermore, DA has a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the migration and motility of human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (NSCLC A549 cells), as determined by trans-well and wound healing assays.
Gelatin zymography analysis, a standard method to detect MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and proteoforms, showed that DA also significantly inhibited the presence of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
These results proved that the anti-metastatic effect of DA was associated with the suppression of enzymes involved in cancer cell migration
DA has also been proposed as an anti-restenosis molecule.
Restenosis is characterized by the abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the stimulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB.
Based on gelatin zymography data, it was suggested that DA dose-dependently decreased the pro-forms of all gelatinases, as well as the active form of MMP-9, in comparison with the control group (PDGF-BB alone).
These results showed that DA decreased the activation and expression levels of both MMP-2 and MMP-9, which are involved in cell migration [105].

Natural Products from Terrestrial Source That Modulate MMP-2 and/or MMP-9
Natural bioactive products, phytochemicals, and nutraceuticals extracted from plants, minerals, animals, and microorganism have been the source of most of the bioactive molecules used in traditional medicine.
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of natural products in various pathologies including degenerative and neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD, HD, ALS, and MS
Due to their multifunctional properties, natural products may interfere with AD progression at all stages including the formation and clearance of pathological aggregates, the release of damaging reactive oxygen species, and even neuroinflammation.
Recently, Andrade et al. generated a detailed overview of the state of the art of natural molecules and natural extracts currently studied in AD
Interesting, the majority of natural molecules reported as a potential drug candidate against AD also influence MMP-2 and MMP-9.

In a human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HCCLM3 cells), Que inhibits cell migration and invasion in vitro, and it has been suggested that these anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects are due to the ability of Que to downregulate the protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9
Moreover, the effect of Que was also studied in human oral cancer cell lines (HSC-6 and SCC-9 cells), where Que also decreased the abundances of MMP-9 and MMP-2
In an asphyxia-based rat model for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), rats treated with treated by intragastric injection of 50 mg/kg quercetin once a day for five days had significantly less reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inflammation, and MMP-2 protein expression

Myricetin, (Myr), Table
Several studies have illustrated that Mir can exert anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects
Myr acts as an anti-cancer agent through different mechanisms including the modulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
It inhibits MMP-2 protein expression in colorectal carcinoma cells (COLO 205).
Furthermore, one study reported that purified MMP-2 incubated with Myr had reduced activity when analyzed by gelatin gel zymography
Recently, it has been reported that Myr suppresses breast cancer metastasis through the downregulation of the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (MDA-Mb-231Br cells)
In another study, the effect of Myr on the migration and invasion of radioresistant lung cancer cells (A549-IR cells) was investigated.

Recently, Myr has been studied in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced mouse model of epilepsy (C57BL/6 male mice).
It is known that PTZ-induction increases the expression of MMP-9 and that the selective inhibition of MMP-9 confers neuroprotection in patients with epilepsy.
Interestingly, treatment with Myr (100-200 mg/kg, orally for 26 days, 30 min prior to each PTZ injection) reduced the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner, thus confirming the neuroprotective role of Myr

Moreover, Bai was tested in a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell line (BON1 cells), and the observed reduction of tumor migration and invasion related to the decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9
Recently, it has been reported that Bai contributes to reduced metastasis in osteosarcoma.
Upon treatment with Bai, the invasive capacity of human osteosarcoma cells (CRL-1427 cells) was reduced.
This result was attributed to a series of enzymes modulated by Bai, including the reduced production of MMP-9 and MMP-2

Conclusions and Future Prospective
AD is a chronic crippling disease for which the approved drugs are only palliative.
In this manuscript, we briefly discuss the complex role that MMPs, specifically the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, have in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
It is clear that by modifying structural proteins and altering the functions of cytokines, MMPs contribute to the progression of neuropathology.
In addition, in several in vivo studies, the beneficial effects of targeting MMPs in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were confirmed.
Both in clinical and preclinical studies, it was shown that many natural products from marine and terrestrial sources are promising bioactive substances for AD treatment.
Interestingly, many of these natural products also have the ability to modulate MMP-2 and MMP-9.
In this manuscript, we summarized the MMP-2 and MMP-9-modulatory activities of marine and terrestrial compounds with known beneficial effects on processes involved in AD pathology.
Many natural compounds appear to regulate signal transduction pathways, thus leading to the simultaneous downregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene and protein expression.
While such effects might correspond with general anti-oxidant and antiinflammatory properties, for some compounds, direct anti-proteolytic activity on MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 has been established (e.g., ATPGDEG, LSGYGP, BU-4664L, ageladine A, quercetin and myricetin).
In addition, several compounds require further research to decipher their exact regulator mechanisms.
For example, it is imperative to determine whether their activity is due to the direct inhibition of the proteolytic mechanisms of MMPs or due to the direct or indirect modulation of signaling pathways upstream of MMP production.
In conclusion, natural compounds might represent a pipeline or 'blueprint' to develop new molecules that can modulate MMPs.
Furthermore, the inhibition of MMPs in combination with other properties such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity, as well as abilities such as diffusion across the blood-brain barrier, might provide valuable for treatments against AD progression.
