Ajmalicine and Reserpine: Indole Alkaloids as Multi-Target Directed Ligands Towards Factors Implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by exponential loss of memory and cognitive deficit involving several disease modifying targets (amyloid beta, beta-secretase, monoaminoxidase-B, and cholinesterase).
The present study explores multi-target directed ligand approach using secondary metabolite reserpine (RES) and ajmalicine (AJM) obtained from Rauwolfia serpentina roots.
Novel LCMS and HPLC methods were developed for identification and quantification of reserpine and ajmalicine.
In vitro enzyme inhibition assays were performed to evaluate anti-cholinesterase, β-site amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) inhibition and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibition, further analyzed with in silico analysis.
Anti-amyloidogenic potential was studied using anti-aggregation studies along with TEM and circular dichroism (CD) analysis.
In vitro neuroprotective potential against Aβ toxicity and anti-oxidative stress was demonstrated using PC12 cell cultures.
Reserpine is a more potent dual cholinesterase inhibitor than ajmalicine (IC 50 values of 1.7 µM (AChE) and 2.8 µM (BuChE)).
The anti-aggregation activity of reserpine (68%) was more than ajmalicine (56%).
Both compounds demonstrated neuroprotective activity against Aβ42 (92%) and H 2 O 2 (93%) induced toxicity in PC12 cells against controls.
Phytocompounds also inhibited MAO-B and BACE-1 enzymes in concentration dependent manner.
Molecular docking studies indicated the strong binding of compounds to the catalytic site of targets.
This novel study demonstrated that reserpine and ajmalicine as a multi-target directed ligand that have disease modifying potential for amelioration of AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline.
The increasing disease burden is estimated to double every 20 years according to the World Alzheimer Report 2016
The worldwide economic burden is approximately US $800 billion per year
AD is a complex multifactorial disease involving several identified targets.
According to amyloid hypothesis, β-site amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) at its extracellular site followed by intra-membrane cleavage by γ-secretase releasing insoluble Aβ peptides (Aβ40 or Aβ42 residues) causing extracellular plaque formation in amyloidogenic pathway of AD.
Aβ42 aggregation also induces oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS), which creates a feedback loop accelerating Aβ42 fibrillation further
Another affected target in AD is cholinergic neurotransmission in CNS due to reduced choline neurotransmitter secretion
Despite advanced AD researches, the current treatment strategies for AD mainly deal with providing symptomatic relief by improving cholinergic neurotransmission in CNS.
Currently approved drugs for AD includes anti-cholinesterase, such as donepezil, galanthamine, and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists (memantine)
At present, no disease modifying drugs are available for the treatment of AD.
Due to multifactorial nature of AD, several therapeutic strategies were devised that include prevention and inhibition of Aβ42 aggregation and reducing oxidative stress in CNS
In view of these, multiple targets were identified in AD such as Aβ42 peptide, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), BACE-1, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
The current strategy involved a multi-target directed ligand (MTDL) approach where the drug molecule(s) can target key enzymes along with disease causing peptides involved in AD, simultaneously, with single or multiple compounds that might be useful in providing therapeutic relief to AD patients.
The PC12 cells are used as in vitro model systems to induce toxicity by Aβ fibrils or H 2 O 2
Rauwolfia serpentina has been mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts for its nootropic activity and treatment of various CNS disorders associated with psychosis, schizophrenia, insanity, insomnia, and epilepsy
Previous studies reported several phyto-constituents present in R. serpentina extract such as yohimbine, ajmaline, reserpine, and serpentine
The major secondary metabolites in the current study, are indole alkaloids; reserpine (RES) and ajmalicine (AJM).
Reserpine previously reported having antihypertensive properties that can also cross blood brain barrier because of its lipid solubility nature, whereas ajmalicine has also been reported for its antihypertensive activity
The selected compounds demonstrated to bind with AD targets and imparts anti-cholinesterase, anti-amyloidogenic, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activity along with anti-BACE-1 and anti-MAO B potential.

Results

Metabolites Identification Using UHPLC-QTOF/MS
UHPLC-QTOF MS was used for metabolite analysis of R. serpentina hydro-alcoholic extract.
Crude extract was analyzed for masses present, in both electron spray ionization (ESI) positive and ESI negative mode.
The masses that were detected consistently as [M + H] and [M -H] ions were identified and matched with literature database and identity of metabolites was established (Table
ESI positive mode gave better metabolite profiling; as it detected maximum number of constituents therefore further analysis was carried out in ESI positive mode.
There were few unmatched and thus unidentified masses, which consistently appeared in trace quantities in LCMS runs.
The individual peaks of chromatogram were resolved to the presence of a single metabolite, majorly proving the efficacy of the novel LCMS method developed (Figure
There were some trace impurity peaks present in the solvent (methanol blank) but it was ensured that these masses did not interfere with elution or profile of the desired metabolites (Figure

Reverse phase HPLC Method Development and Validation for RES and AJM Quantification
RES and AJM identified from LCMS were quantified using commercially purchased standards.
A novel reproducible reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) method for sensitive and rapid detection (or quantification) of RES and AJM was optimized for each, using economic solvents.
The methods were validated according to "International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use" for stability, linearity, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ) levels (Table
The calibration curve was plotted between absorbance and different concentrations (0.5-3.5 ppm) of test compound and linear regression equation was obtained.
A correlation coefficient (R 2 ) greater than 0.999 indicates good linearity thus the results showed an excellent correlation exists between the peak area and respective concentration of the compound (RES and AJM).
Peak asymmetry greater than '1′ indicates peak tailing and less than '1′ indicates peak fronting.
In the current study, both the methods developed have their peak asymmetry ratio around 1, which is a

Relative standard deviation (RSD) determination gives a validation for method precision.
The RSD percentages for both the methods are low (RSD < 3%) therefore the RP-HPLC method precision is good.
LOD and LOQ are calculated from signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in multiples of 3 and 10, respectively.
As a measure of sensitive method development, it was found that as minimum as 2.8 ppm for RES and 3.7 ppm for AJM could be successfully detected in the sample.
Moreover, a least amount of 9.76 ppm for RES and 10.5 ppm for AJM could be successfully quantified in the sample using the developed method.
After successful RP-HPLC method development, respective compounds were quantified in R. serpentina extract.
With six injections of standard, three individual injections of samples were chromatographed through the system.

Anti-Amyloidogenic Effect of RES and AJM
Amyloidogenesis involves aggregation of Aβ monomers into oligomers and proto-fibrils that leads to formation of plaques in CNS.
The anti-aggregation potential of RES and AJM was analyzed through thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay along with evaluation of red shift in Congo red (CR) dye binding assay.
ThT probe gives bright fluorescence upon binding exclusively to Aβ42 proto-fibrils at 480 nm (emission) whereas free ThT quenches at the same excitation wavelength (450 nm), which makes it the most widely used probe against amyloid fibril detection.
RES and AJM significantly inhibited the formation of Aβ42 fibrils in concentration dependent manner (11-44 µM), with 69% inhibition of fluorescence by RES (at 44 µM) (Figure
AJM and hydro-alcoholic root extract of R. serpentina demonstrated inhibition of aggregation (57% at 44 µM) and (51% at 100 µg/mL), respectively, as compared to control samples (Aβ42 only).
An 85% inhibition of fluorescence was observed when Aβ42 incubated with tannic acid (positive control).
The results indicate statistically significant anti-aggregation effect of RES and AJM.

Congo red dye absorption spectra also support ThT determination of Aβ42 fibril inhibition in spectral shift assay.
Upon Aβ42 interaction, CR undergoes a red shift in absorbance from 480nm to 500-550 nm.
CR assay showed a typical absorbance at 490 nm whereas when Aβ42 added to CR the absorbance wavelength is shifted to 530 nm (Figure
RES, AJM, and R. serpentina extract incubated with Aβ42 fibrils demonstrated reduced CR red shift close to 510 nm indicating strong anti-aggregation property of test compounds.

Evaluation of Inhibition of β Sheet Formation
Aβ42 undergoes conformational changes during the process of oligomerization from random coil α-helix to structured β-sheets
This change in the secondary structure is measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in far UV region (200-250 nm), where the increase in negative bend near 215 nm is directly proportional to increased β-sheets content.

The secondary structure content (α-helix, β-sheets, and turns) was determined using CD spectra analysis software
During Aβ fibrillation process, α-helix structure was found to be zero after 48 h incubation, while the β-sheet content increased to 75% in Aβ42 control (Table
RES demonstrated 64% inhibition in β-sheet formation whereas AJM inhibited the aggregation process to 53% as compared to control (Aβ42 only).
This result is complementary to inhibition percentage of Aβ42 aggregation shown by ThT analysis.

Morphological Validation of Inhibition of Aβ42 Aggregates Formation
The influence of RES and AJM on fibril formation was studied by analyzing the morphologies of Aβ42 aggregates by TEM.
After 48 h of aggregation process, Aβ42 control showed abundant long, branched, and dense fibrils with peptide nucleation, which is characteristic of amyloids whereas RES and AJM shows shorter, loose, and less Aβ42 fibrils along with small oligomers (Figure

RES and AJM Protects PC12 Cells Against Aβ42 Inflicted Cytotoxicity
Further investigation was done to study the cytotoxic effect of Aβ42 and protection against its neurotoxic effect by RES and AJM towards PC12 cells using MTT assay.
PC12 cells resemble the phenotype of sympathetic ganglion neurons and are therefore used as model system to study neuroprotection against damages in AD
Aβ42 is more toxic than Aβ40 oligomers in AD, therefore in the current study Aβ42 was used to induce toxicity.
PC12 cells exposed to various concentrations of Aβ42 (2.5-80 μM) for 24 h showed concentration dependent cytotoxicity, evident by decrease in the rate of MTT reduction.
Therefore, to study the protection by compounds, a fixed concentration of Aβ42 40 μM was used to induce damage towards PC12 cells.
PC12 cells showed significant concentration dependent survival in the presence of RES (92%) and AJM (67%) at equimolar concentration of Aβ42 (40 μM).
R. serpentina extract also imparted 55% protection against Aβ42 cytotoxicity at 100 μg/mL which was comparable to the protection given by homotaurine (58%), used as positive control in the study (Figure

In Vitro Neuroprotection Against Oxidative Stress
Oxidative stress and generation of ROS have been shown to induce lipid peroxidation in cell membrane, which leads to cellular damage and subsequent cell death.
Thus, the protective effect of RES and AJM against H2O2 induced oxidative stress towards PC12 cells was evaluated by MTT assay.

At extract concentration of 100 μg/mL highest viability was observed (86.4%) as compared to 31% viability in negative control group (H2O2 treatment alone).
While PC12 cells had statistically significant results, surviving to 93% with RES (40 μM) treatment and to 89% with AJM (40 μM) treatment.
The positive control glutathione (GSH) used in the study imparted 91% protection against H2O2 induced oxidative stress.

Evaluation of Dual Anti-Cholinesterase Potential of RES and AJM
Cholinergic neurotransmission is severely affected in AD, thus, to prolong neurotransmission a suitable drug compound must have anti-cholinesterase effect.
RES and AJM achieved statistically significant dual anticholinesterase inhibition along with R. serpentina extract in concentration dependent manner (Figure

Table
Selectivity is the measure of inhibition for a particular enzyme over the other.
In later stages of AD, BuChE levels increases in brain.
BuChE catalyzes acetylcholine as it's substrate.
Therefore, the BuChE inhibition becomes important along with AChE inhibition.
Although RES and AJM have selectivity for AChE, the results suggest almost equivalent inhibition for BuChE.

β-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 Inhibition
The BACE-1 enzyme inhibition has been shown to reduce the amount of pathogenic Aβ42 formation, which makes it one of the important targets for AD
The results of the current study demonstrate the efficacy of lead compounds to inhibit the enzyme effectively (Figure
AJM showed the maximum inhibition of BACE-1 activity to 69% at 50 µM concentration whereas RES imparted 47% inhibition at same concentration.
Therefore, AJM inhibitory potential was evaluated at various concentrations and AJM showed statistically significant BACE-1 enzyme inhibition in concentration dependent manner at various concentrations tested (25, 50, 100 µM) (Figure

Molecular Interaction of RES and AJM with AD Targets
Molecular docking revealed interaction of RES and AJM with catalytic site residues of studied AD targets (Aβ42, AChE, BuChE, BACE-1, and MAO-B) giving insight of the mechanism of inhibition of respective enzymes and peptide that correlate with in vitro studies.
Molecular docking analysis (Table
RES and AJM strongly interacted with Aβ42 key residues with very low binding energy.
Lower binding energy implies stable protein-ligand complex, thus, strong interaction.
Based on the binding energies RES and AJM demonstrated better Aβ42 anti-aggregation potential as compared to positive control (tannic acid).
Similarly, RES and AJM are better AChE and BuChE inhibitors as compared to positive control (galanthamine and tacrine) attributed to low binding energies signifying strong and stable interaction.
AJM interacted with MAO-B catalytic site residue through hydrogen bond while RES interacted with comparatively weak hydrophobic environment suggesting AJM is better MAO-B inhibitor than RES.

Pharmacokinetics Analysis
Pharmacokinetics analysis for ADMET, of identified phytoconstituents showed that AJM proves to be a more ideal drug molecule as it obeys Lipinski rule of five along with suitable profile to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) (Table
While RES failed to obey Lipinski rule of five majorly because of its molecular weight (above 500 g/mol) but showed good potential to cross the BBB.
All the positive controls showed ideal drug profiles.

Discussion
Pathophysiology of AD is attributed to diverse, complex factors such as cognitive decline, memory loss, and extracellular plaque formation along with neurofibrillary tangles.
From the inception of amyloid cascade hypothesis to its reappraisal, it is considered to be the primary cause of this form of senile dementia
With the advent of research and new disease progression insights, now we can assign more targets with responsibility towards either pathophysiology or associated symptoms
Despite major pharma-research focused on discovering novel disease-modifying molecules, the current treatment for AD targets its affiliated symptoms only
In accordance with the aforesaid fact, we investigated the potential of natural compounds from R. serpentina (reserpine and ajmalicine) for their MTDL properties.
Naturally occurring alkaloids have long been used in therapeutic strategies against AD, such as galanthamine and huperzineA that are used in providing symptomatic relief to AD patients
R. serpentina is abundant in many indole alkaloids such as reserpine, serpentine, rauwolfine, sarpagine, ajmaline, yohimbine, and ajmalicine
In the current study the most abundant phytoconstituents identified in our test extract by UPLC-QTOF method were RES and AJM.
Previous studies have shown similar identification of secondary metabolite profile of R. serpentina by UPLC-UV
RES and AJM were quantified by a novel method developed and validated for RP-HPLC using an UV detector.
This method is rapid and precise as they give reliable elution at early retention time using organic mobile phase as compared to previously reported methods
The RP-HPLC method used in the current study has many advantages as compared to previously reported methods.
These advantages are low LOD and LOQ as it offers sensitive detection and quantification of RES and AJM in trace amount.
Aβ42 is a 4KDa fragment of mature APP, which self-aggregate to form toxic Aβ42 oligomers and finally proto-fibrils that are considered as a main pathological factor implicated in AD
Compounds, which could inhibit Aβ42 aggregation or reverse this process of peptide nucleation would be of great therapeutic interest.
Current study results showed concentration dependent, statistically significant anti-amyloidogenic potential of RES, AJM, and hydro-alcoholic root extract of R. serpentina.
The exact mechanism of Aβ42 oligomerization to insoluble plaque formation is not clear but the secondary structure conformation studies suggest that β-sheet content is increased in Aβ42 oligomerization
CD analysis results were in accordance to this observation as the reduced percentage of β-sheet content in RES and AJM treated samples of Aβ42 showed equivalent inhibition percentage in Aβ42 self-aggregation.
The fact is further validated with electron micrographs showing short, unbranched fibrils and no peptide nucleation in RES and AJM treated samples of Aβ42 as compared to control (Aβ42 only).
Insight of the inhibition mechanism could be understood by observing interactions at the molecular level.
As evident from molecular docking analysis, RES, and AJM stacks themselves in between adjacent β-sheets and therefore inhibit further oligomerization.
RES forms hydrogen bond with key residue (Asp23) and interacted hydrophobically to Lys 28 of Aβ42, bound internally in the steric zipper composed of KLVFFA (residues
Besides, RES also oriented itself to cover the hydrophobic core residues (Leu17, Val18, Phe19, and Phe20) of Aβ42, stabilizing the complex further.
Aβ42 assembly requires Asp23 of one monomer to form a hydrogen bond with Lys28 of another monomer therefore to conclude RES can potentially inhibit Aβ42 aggregation.
Furthermore, RES gave a binding score comparable to positive control compound (tannic acid).
AJM interacts more with hydrophobic core inside steric zipper via hydrophobic interactions.
It also bound to Asp23 with one hydrogen bond therefore it covers the residue (Asp23) required for oligomerization and hence inhibited Aβ42 aggregation process.
Aβ42 oligomerization has been shown to accelerate upon AChE binding to Aβ42 by hydrophobic environment near peripheral active site (PAS) of AChE
The indole ring of RES formed hydrogen bond with catalytic anionic site (CAS) residues Glu334 along with another hydrogen bond with Tyr72 in PAS of AChE.
Similarly, AJM interacted with hydrogen bond towards Tyr286 (PAS residue) and Phe295-Phe297 in acyl binding pocket of CAS of AChE.
Therefore, RES and AJM successfully occupy both the CAS and PAS of AChE, thereby inhibiting the enzyme as well inhibit AChE induced Aβ42 aggregation.
The molecular docking results are well complemented with in vitro results of enzyme inhibition assay.
In advanced cases of AD, BuChE secretion increases responsible for hydrolysis of AChE as it's substrate.
This accelerates the cholinergic decline process further.
RES and AJM counteract the decrease in neurotransmitter levels (AChE) by significantly inhibiting BuChE in concentration dependent manner evident from in vitro enzyme inhibition assay.
The molecular interactions showed strong binding energies of RES and AJM with BuChE, suggesting stable protein-ligand complex.
Tacrine (known inhibitor) had lower docking score then RES and AJM.
RES forms strong hydrogen bond with BuChE CAS residue (Val288) and occupies the PAS by interacting with a residue (Asn68) which lies near PAS (Asp70).
Whereas AJM binds directly to CAS and PAS residues (Trp82 and Asp70, respectively).
Thus, RES and AJM could prove to be better anti-cholinesterase drug ligands for therapeutics towards AD.
BACE-1 enzyme structure is found to exist in three different conformations based on a flap like secondary structure, which covers the active site of the enzyme.
The BACE-1 structure (PDB ID 4D8C) used in the current study is closed flap structure, which is the dominant form exists upon binding to its substrate.
Molecular docking analysis showed that the indole ring of RES interacts with the main catalytic site residues of the BACE-1 enzyme.
The indole ring of RES acts as a hydrogen bond donor for Asp32, forming double hydrogen bond with catalytic site residue of BACE-1 while the isoprene tail of RES forms hydrophobic interaction in the catalytic gorge of BACE-1.
On the other hand, AJM binds more strongly to BACE-1 with all hydrophobic interactions as it gave a high binding score with BACE-1.
Probable explanation could be the stability AJM provides to the hydrophobic catalytic gorge of BACE-1 due to its compact size and orientation then RES.
These molecular interactions are complemented with in vitro results showing statistically significant inhibition of BACE-1 enzyme, where observed potency of AJM is more than RES.
MAO-B enzyme plays an important role in generation of free radicals thus imparting oxidative stress at cellular level.
RES and AJM inhibited MAO-B enzyme in concentration dependent manner comparable to positive control (selegiline).
The in vitro results are complimented by molecular docking analysis where RES was observed to interact with the key catalytic site residues of MAO-B while AJM occupies the catalytic site by interacting with other residues there.
RES interacted with Tyr326 and Ile199 by hydrogen bonding.
AJM gave high binding score then RES probably because AJM formed more strong hydrogen bonds with residues surrounding catalytic site covering the main residues involved in hydrolysis of the substrate.
The ADMET profile of AJM showed promising results of being able to act as ideal drug molecule with BBB permeability while RES structure could be utilized to develop active MTDL drug candidate with small molecular size.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis (ADMET)
ADMET analysis was carried out using Drulito software (www.niper.gov.in/pi_dev_tools/
DruLiToWeb/DruLiTo_index.html) to study ideal pharmacokinetics profile of RES and AJM for drug development.
Two filters were used for screening; Lipinski rule and blood brain barrier.
Lipinski rule states that for an ideal drug molecule should weigh below 500 g/mol, hydrogen bond donor should be less than or equal to 5 and number of hydrogen bond acceptor should be less than or equal to 10 along with a partition coefficient of 5 or less.
Such compounds would pass the BBB if the number of hydrogen bonds present is below eight and there should not be any acidic group present in the molecule.
Total polar surface area (TPSA) showed bioavailability of the drug molecule as per Veber's rule the TPSA less than or equal to 140Å indicates good oral bioavailability.

Statistical Analysis
Three independent experiments and each experiment with three replicates, were used in each experimental setup to present data as mean ± standard error mean but for LCMS data n = 4 runs were used.
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA for comparing independent means, followed by Bonferroni post test for multiple comparisons of experimental setups with control groups.
Level of significance was determined as p ≤ 0.05 and p < 0.01, until otherwise stated.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the novel study showed that RES and AJM could act as multi-target directed ligands and can be used to develop into novel compound that can be used against several targets Aβ42, AChE, BuChE, MAO-B, BACE-1, and ROS that are implicated in AD and thus, help in alleviation of symptoms and having disease modifying effect in AD.

Table 4 indicates the IC 50 values along with the selectivity of the inhibition by respective compounds for AChE and BuChE.
Selectivity is the measure of inhibition for a particular enzyme over the other.
In later stages of AD, BuChE levels increases in brain.
BuChE catalyzes acetylcholine as it's substrate.
Therefore, the BuChE inhibition becomes important along with AChE inhibition.
Although RES and AJM have selectivity for AChE, the results suggest almost equivalent inhibition for BuChE.
