The Complexity of Microglial Interactions With Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells in Alzheimer’s Disease
In the naïve mouse brain, microglia and astrocytes are the most abundant immune cells; however, there is a complexity of other immune cells present including monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytic cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells.
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is high inflammation, reactive microglia, and astrocytes, leaky blood-brain barrier, the buildup of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles which attract infiltrating peripheral immune cells that are interacting with the resident microglia.
Limited studies have analyzed how these infiltrating immune cells contribute to the neuropathology of AD and even fewer have analyzed their interactions with the resident microglia.
Understanding the complexity and dynamics of how these immune cells interact in AD will be important for identifying new and novel therapeutic targets.
Thus, this review will focus on discussing our current understanding of how macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, T cells, and B cells, alongside astrocytes, are altered in AD and what this means for the disorder, as well as how these cells are affected relative to the resident microglia.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease with core neuropathological features including the amassing of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) along with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline
Until more recently, the focus on AD has been the treatment of Aβ plaques through directly modulating the plaques; however, these treatments have not cured the underlying neuropathology of the disease
This had led investigators to pursue other avenues, including a newer hallmark feature of neuroinflammation, where increases have been observed throughout the brain in individuals with AD
Exactly how this neuroinflammation is accumulating remains to be fully understood, but two glial cells, microglia and astrocytes, both of which are involved inflammation, have come forward as potential major contributors
Microglia specifically have become the main focus of the neuroinflammation alongside their phagocytic capacity
It is well known that peripheral immune cells can contribute to neuroinflammation once they enter the brain
Even in the wild type (WT) mouse brain, a complexity of immune cells have been noted, including monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells, with microglia and astrocytes as the most abundant cells in the central nervous system (CNS)
A "leaky" blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been observed in individuals with AD
Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), increases in BBB leakage in the gray matter, hippocampus, and cortex has been shown to be significantly correlated with a decrease in cognitive function
There was an increase in soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, a marker of injury to pericytes, in the cerebral spinal fluid in these individuals, as well as in Tg2576 mice, indicating a breakdown in the BBB
Through the breakdown of the BBB in AD pathology, cells can infiltrate the brain and affect the pathology; these cells include peripheral macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the brains of both humans and mice, and NK cells and B cells in the mouse brain
However, how these cells interact with microglia in AD warrants further investigation.
Here we will discuss current literature regarding microglial interaction with peripheral immune cells in the context of the different models of AD (Table

Microglia in AD
Microglia are the main immune cells for the CNS.
They are responsible for monitoring and maintaining the homeostatic environment through surveillance.
Once microglia receive "alert" signals, they will react through the morphological altering of their cytoskeleton to respond to pathological events
Based on genome-wide associated studies, roughly 80% of gene changes that occur in AD are found within microglia, implicating them as critical in AD pathology
However, the exact role of microglia during the progression of AD remains unknown.
The magnitude to which microglia contribute to the AD brain has been up for debate.
Microglia have also been observed alongside NFT in both human AD and in animal models
Recent studies have suggested that microglia may be contributing to the buildup and accumulation of Aβ plaques
Initially, alongside their contribution to inflammation, microglia will phagocytose Aβ clusters in the AD environment, which can lead to a buildup of intracellular Aβ
Early studies showed that Aβ can accumulate inside of microglia, as Aβ has been observed to be difficult for cells to degrade
In the presence of an apoptotic-associated speck-like protein, microglia become unable to destroy Aβ and undergo pyroptotic death
This can add to the increase of Aβ plaques through the accrual of dead microglia
Furthermore, it has been shown that there is an increase in RIPK1, a marker for necroptosis, co-localizing with ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) + cells in both individuals with AD and APP/PS1 mice
When RIPK1 is inhibited, there is a decrease in the Aβ plaque load, reductions in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1β, and improved behavioral performance in reversal learning in the APP/PS1 mice
This further supports the hypothesis that microglial death may be playing a role in the increased plaque formation.
In APP/PS1/Trem2 -/-mice, the Aβ plaques are much more defused throughout the brain, with reduced microglial engulfment of the Aβ plaques
In models of neuronal injury, Trigger receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) depletion in microglia limits their ability to migrate toward injured neurons
Therefore, Trem2 may have a larger role in microglial migration toward Aβ plaques and their ability to contain them.
Similar observations have been observed after depletion of microglia in APP/PS1 mice
These reports support the idea that microglia are aiding in the accumulation of the plaque formations found in AD.
Profile analysis of microglia at different stages of AD has also given more insight into their role in disease.
Early in AD, microglia tend to be associated with increased activation and inflammation, with later phagocytic dysfunction
A similar subset of microglia was observed in 18-month-old geriatric mice and 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice; these microglia were notably different from those in WT 4-month-old adult mice
Microglia in both the geriatric WT and APP/PS1 mice had increased expression of the phagocytic associated markers, CD11c and CD14
Specifically, CD11c + microglia were located around Aβ plaques.
Moreover, this subset of microglia, termed "disease-associated microglia" (DAMs), had increased expression of CD44 and CD86, and the inhibitory ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) as well as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules, whereas the homeostatic markers, MerTK, CX3C chemokine receptor 1, and Siglec-H were decreased
A similar subset of microglia, which also had increases in Trem2 and apolipoprotein E (APOE), was observed in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD
Interestingly, both of these genes have been determined to be AD risk factors
The exact mechanism(s) by which DAMs may affect AD pathology and whether these cells are the result of pathological changes or contribute directly to the pathology requires further investigation.
As the data suggest, microglia are not entirely responsible for all of the pathology of AD; this is evident by alterations present in other peripheral immune cells in the brain.

Astrocytes and Microglia in AD
Astrocytes are the other most well-known glial cell.
They are involved in the homeostasis and maintenance of neurons and they do this through controlling the BBB and regulating neuronal communication
In vitro work has also
shown that astrocytes contribute to the production of proinflammatory cytokines
Crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia have been observed to induce microglial motility, microglia and astrocyte accumulation, and potentially both of their phagocytic capabilities
This cross-talk is thought to be through three main mechanisms: the communication between both cells directly, synchrony; both cell responding to injury and aiding in each other's response; and a relay effect, where one cell receives the signal and "relays" it onto the other cell
Through RNA sequencing, APOE has been found to be upregulated in astrocytes as well as microglia
Similar to microglia, astrocytes have also been found to be in a disease-associated state with an elevation in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels and increases in genes related to inflammatory signaling and response to toxic compounds
These toxic-reactive astrocytes, termed A1, have been shown to be induced by activated microglia through pro-inflammatory cytokines, and have been observed to be increased in the pre-frontal cortex in individuals with AD
It has also been observed that astrocytes require TNF-α to become A1, which has been shown to be released from microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils
In AD tissue, the loss of myelination of neurons was followed by an increase in GFAP expression
This increase in GFAP was also found in close proximity to NFTs in both human AD and animal models
The depletion of tau in rTg4510 mice reduced the number of GFAP-, CD3-, and CD4-positive cells and prevented the loss of the BBB
In the TgF344 rat model of AD, there is an increase in astrocytes that produce a co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) on neurons, which could aid in their excitotoxicity and death
In GFAP ± /APP swe /PSEN1 E9 mice, astrocytic levels are decreased with no change in plaque formation at 15 months and an increased number of IBA1 + cells

Models of AD
This implicates astrocytes as a potential contributor to neuronal changes in AD pathology and microglial activation.
More studies are necessary to further explore how microglia and astrocytes may work together to aid in the AD environment.

Macrophages and Microglia in AD
Macrophages are the chief phagocytes in the periphery
The main job of macrophages is to phagocytose pathogens and apoptotic cells.
They are also very critical antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
Macrophages present peptide antigens via MHCI and II molecules.
They also release signals to stimulate the migration of other cells to injured or infected tissue
Recently, a subset of macrophages has been found in the brain called brain associated macrophages (BAMs)
BAMs are located within the CNS in the border region areas, including the pia mater, perivascular space, choroid plexus, and dura mater and are replaced by circulating monocytes
Through the use of mass cytometry,
They also found different expression profiles of the BAMs leading them into three different subsets based on their levels of CD38 and MHCII; these subsets were found in different regions of the brain.
The dura mater had the highest expression of MHCII+ CD38-cells, while the pia mater and perivascular space had higher levels of MHCII+ CD38 + cells followed by those that were MHCII-CD38 + ; the choroid plexus had a mixture of all three subclasses
The finding of BAMs and their unique and heterogenous expression has been demonstrated in non-pathological and pathological conditions in mice, with similar findings observed in human brain tissue
In PDGF-APPSw, Ind J20 mice, a genetic increase in perivascular BAMs, through the deletion of scavenger receptor class B, enhanced the development of Aβ deposits and exacerbated the cognitive deficits
Similar results were found in the TgCRND8 model of AD mice
When perivascular BAMs were stimulated, this led to a decrease in vascular levels of Aβ, whereas depletion of the BAMs led to an increase in Aβ
In 3-month-old Tg2576 mice, the number of BAMs was not altered compared to WT controls.
However, when BAMs in the perivascular space were depleted with clodronate, that led to cerebrovascular dysfunction that was induced by Aβ
Thus, this implicates BAMs in AD pathology.
Currently, most studies focus on either microglia or macrophages or collectively analyze both of them together in AD.
A reason for this is the similarity in phenotype between the two cell types, making it difficult to fully differentially distinguish them
However, recent advances in profiling microglia and macrophages have made it easier to look at each population individually
For example, initial studies, using electron microscopy, analyzing both microglia and macrophages have shown that macrophages are more effective at eliminating Aβ plaques
Moreover, the stimulation of tolllike receptor 9 (TLR9) by its ligand, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpGODNs), caused an increase in the phagocytosis of Aβ plaques thought to be initially a microglial response.
However, CpGODNs cannot easily penetrate the BBB, supporting the hypothesis that it is a macrophage response and not directly a microglial response
During aging, microglia and macrophages have a directly opposite response
There has also been much debate about whether microglia or macrophages are associated with the formation of amyloid plaques.
Knocking out macrophage chemokine receptor CCR2 in the Tg2576 mice, showed less accumulation of both microglia and macrophages
Together, these data suggest that in the AD brain, the microglia are potentially more impactful in the pathology compared to the infiltrating macrophages.
More studies are necessary to differentiate how both cells are interacting in AD.

Neutrophils and Microglia in AD
Alongside macrophages, neutrophils are also responsible for phagocytosis but are mainly found in the bloodstream
Typically, neutrophils are one of the first responders to injury or infection.
Once they arrive, neutrophils recruit other immune cells to the site of injury and phagocytose microbes.
Neutrophils can also increase their response in reaction to multiple signals, which can be beneficial, or in the case of chronic inflammatory disease, can be detrimental
In healthy elderly subjects, there is reduced activity of neutrophils present in the blood compared to young adults
AD patients have an even greater reduction in neutrophil function in the later stages of disease; however, in the early stages of AD, there are more neutrophils present compared to agematched healthy controls
The glutathione and oxidized glutathione ratio, an indicator of oxidative stress in cells, has been shown to be increased in the neutrophils from patients in the early stages of AD compared to agematched healthy subjects; this ratio was further increased in late stages of severe AD and coupled with the increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
However, there was a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokine production
Notably, neutrophils have been found in the brain during homeostatic conditions
They can cross the BBB through the interactions between lymphocyte functionassociated antigen 1 (LFA-1) found on circulating neutrophils and its receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1).
When LFA-1 is knocked out genetically (Itgal -/-) or blocked by an antibody, neutrophils are unable to enter the brain
LFA-1-deficient 3xTg mice or normal 3xTg mice treated with an anti-LFA-1 mAb showed reduced cognitive impairments in the Y-maze and reduced accumulation of IBA1 + cells in the hippocampus along with reduced levels of Aβ plaques (Figure
Most frequently, neutrophils were found through live imaging that they traveled via diapedesis to areas with Aβ deposits and accumulated around Aβ plaques
Although Aβ plaques cannot recruit neutrophils directly, it has been shown that microglia in the AD pathology can recruit neutrophils to the brain
In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that the recruitment of neutrophils may lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglia
As prior studies have suggested, it is also likely that microglia are involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to Aβ plaques
Based on these reports, it has been proposed that neutrophils first engulf the Aβ plaques, and then microglia phagocytose the neutrophils.
Further investigation is necessary to understand the relationship between microglia and neutrophils, and their engulfment of Aβ plaques.

NK Cells and Microglia in AD
NK cells are a subpopulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes that is a part of the innate immune response.
NK cells can respond quickly upon activation, and they can kill cells without pre-stimulation from other cells
NK cells initiate apoptosis in other cells through the release of cytotoxic granules; most commonly, granzyme B
They can also release inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), that stimulate other immune cells, especially macrophages, and contribute to chronic inflammation which is detrimental to the brain
They can secrete immunosuppressive cytokines
During aging in healthy individuals, the cytotoxic activity of circulating NK cells is impaired relative to young adults
In a report studying individuals with mild AD, there was no change in NK cell activation capacity when comparing the expression of CD107a, a marker for granular release, and levels of granzyme B and IFN-γ (Le
In Rag2 -/-/Il2rγ -/-knockout mice crossed with 5xFAD mice, NK cells, T cells, and B cells do not develop and these mice have increased Aβ levels
These mice also have elevations in the numbers of IBA1 + cells with an altered morphology, from ramified to bushy and amoeboid
However, whether these effects are directly related to the lack of NK cells or the loss of the three lymphocyte subpopulations remains to be investigated.
In T-and B cell-deficient (but NK cell-sufficient) Rag2 -/- mice crossed with PSAPP mice, there is a decrease in the number of Aβ plaques
However, unlike that observed with the 5xFAD/Rag2 -/-/Il2rγ -/-mice, there was no change in intracellular IBA1 levels, but the number of astrocytes was decreased
There was also no recovery in performance in novel object recognition in the PSAPP/Rag2 -/-mice compared to the PSAPP mice (Figure
Together, these results indicate that NK cells may be more involved in IBA1 activation compared to T-and B cells (these cells are discussed below); however, this warrants further investigation with Il2rγ -/-deficient mice.

T Cells and Microglia in AD
T cells are a type of lymphocyte that responds to immune challenges as a part of the adaptive immune system
There are three major types of T cells: cytotoxic (Tc; CD8+), helper (Th; CD4+), and regulatory (Treg; CD4+)
Tc cells recognize peptide antigens presented by MHCI molecules.
These are found on all nucleated cells in the body, including those in the CNS.
Upon antigen recognition, they release cytotoxic granules that kill the recognized cells
Th cells are activated by peptides presented by MHCII molecules on professional APCs (macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells) and then release specific cytokines depending on the Th cell subtype: Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells; Th2 cells secrete antiinflammatory cytokines that activate B cells; Th17 cells produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 and cytokines/chemokines that recruit neutrophils and macrophages.
There are other Th cell subtypes (e.g., Th9, Neurath and Kaplan, 2017), but they will not be described here.
Treg cells work to suppress immune cells when they are no longer needed or to maintain immune homeostasis
During aging, it has been observed that there is an increase in the overall number of T cells in the brain
This has also been observed in both APP/PS1 and 5xFAD models of AD
In human cerebral spinal fluid and brain tissue of individuals with AD, an increased number of Tc and Treg cells have also been found, respectively
Tc cells have also been found to be significantly correlated with the increase in NFT and tau pathology in human AD tissue
Although most studies are using both male and female mice grouped together, one found differences in the number of T cells between APP/PS1 males and females, with females having overall more T cells with specific increases in Th and Tc cells
They also found that when microglia were ablated with PLX5622, there was an overall increase in the number of Tc cells in the APP/PS1 mice (Figure
This depletion did not have a gender effect
In 5xFAD mice, intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ-specific Th1 cells decreased plaque load and resulted in an increase in MHCII + cells.
These IBA1+/MHCII+ cells were less ramified in appearance, with shorter branch length.
They also had an increase in Aβ found inside these cells compared to those that were MHCII-
When MHCII knockout mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice, there was a recovery in GFAP levels when compared with 5xFAD mice at 3 months of age.
At 6 months of age, the 5xFAD/MHCII-mice displayed an overall increase in IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ compared to both 5xFAD and WT mice
When Aβ-specific Th1 cells were injected into the 5xFAD/MHCII-mice, there was no variation in overall plaque load, but the levels of IFN-γ were increased; however, these levels did not reach those found in the 5xFAD mice
Together, these data indicate that MHCII + /IBA1 + cells are activated by Th1 cells, potentially indicating a cooperative role between Th cells and microglia/macrophages.
There have also been multiple studies that have implicated the gut microbiota as a factor in affecting the infiltration of T cells into the brain
When APP swe /PSEN1 E9 mice were given combinatorial antibiotics (ABX) that alter the gut microbiome, this led to attenuated Aβ plaque formation as well as increased Treg cells in the brain and blood
This treatment also reduced the number of plaque-localized microglia and astrocytes, as well as altered the morphology of the microglia, increasing the process length to a more ramified morphology in both APPPS1-21 and APP SWE /PS1 E9 mice
However, these effects were not observed in female APPPS1-21 mice
Further work is needed to distinguish between the roles of the different types of T cells in AD and the cognitive consequences of the adoptive transfer of the T cells into the AD mouse brain and to understand AD development in a T cell-deficient environment.

B Cells and Microglia in AD
B cells are involved in the adaptive immune response by producing antibodies that coat target cells, allowing for easier engulfment by macrophages
B cells can release pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines that may contribute to chronic inflammation
As aging occurs, B cells become less able to produce antibodies, and in chronic inflammation, progenitor B cells are more likely to undergo programmed cell death
In both moderate and severe AD, there is an overall decrease in B cells
In 5xFAD mice, a whole-brain analysis showed an increase in the number of mature B cells compared to WT
It has also been observed that B cells secrete antibodies that are Aβ-specific
Here, immunization against Aβ reduced plaques and astrocytic accumulation
However, when this was tried in human clinical trials, the immunization caused a T cell response leading to lifethreatening complications
In 5xFAD mice, elevated levels of IgG are present, and with IgG localizing in and around IBA1 + cells
These increased levels are absent in 5xFAD/Rag2 -/-/Il2rγ -/-mice
Exposure to preimmune IgG elicits a phagocytic response by BV-2 microglia to engulf Aβ
When preimmune IgG is injected into the brain in both the 5xFAD and APP/PS1 mice, there is a reduction in Aβ levels (Figure
Also, WT mouse bone marrow transplanted into 5xFAD/Rag2 -/-/Il2rγ -/-mice resulted in an increase in brain IgG levels and a concurrent reduction in plaque volume
In APOE3-TR mice, there is no change in the number of B cells harvested from the blood; however, there is an increase in IgG levels across the neocortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum
This increase in IgG staining was mostly localized to microglia and not astrocytes
However, early studies showed B cells harvested from individuals with AD were more hyperactivated to NFT and Aβ plaques
These B cells that reacted with NFT also secreted antibodies that reacted highly with astrocytes
This difference between the secreted antibodies reacting with astrocytes and also co-localizing with microglia could be due to the varied response of B cells in humans with AD compared to animal models of AD.
The increase in IgG that is observed, could also be infiltrating from the disrupted BBB.
Studies using a drug, 3K3A-APC, that protects cerebrovascular endothelium cells from damage, showed reduced IgG levels in the cortex of 5XFAD mice
It should also be noted that 3K3A-APC inhibits BACE1 in neurons and treatment of 5XFAD mice with this drug decreases Aβ levels, as well as reduces the number of microglia and astrocytes
Taken together, these data indicate a relationship between B cell production of IgG, IgG infiltration, and phagocytosis, but exactly how IgG is altering microglia requires more investigation.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In AD, current studies focus on modulating Aβ plaque formation and altering the local neuroinflammation; however, other important contributors can consume Aβ plaques and induce neuroinflammation-the peripheral immune cells.
Investigations on AD have analyzed microglia either directly or indirectly with macrophages
However, more questions remain in order to increase our understanding of how these cell types may be interacting and contributing to AD pathology as well as the associated cognitive decline.
It also remains elusive if the peripheral immune cells must enter the brain to affect the AD pathology.
Future studies are necessary to understand these relationships, in terms of how the development of AD occurs and how the pathology continues to become exacerbated, to determine the best course of treatment for AD patients.
