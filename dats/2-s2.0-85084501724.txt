N-AS-triggered SPMs are direct regulators of microglia in a model of Alzheimer’s disease
Sphingosine kinase1 (SphK1) is an acetyl-CoA dependent acetyltransferase which acts on cyclooxygenase2 (COX2) in neurons in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the mechanism underlying this activity was unexplored.
Here we show that N-acetyl sphingosine (N-AS) is first generated by acetyl-CoA and sphingosine through SphK1.
N-AS then acetylates serine 565 (S565) of COX2, and the N-AS-acetylated COX2 induces the production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs).
In a mouse model of AD, microglia show a reduction in N-AS generation, leading to decreased acetyl-S565 COX2 and SPM production.
Treatment with N-AS increases acetylated COX2 and N-AS-triggered SPMs in microglia of AD mice, leading to resolution of neuroinflammation, an increase in microglial phagocytosis, and improved memory.
Taken together, these results identify a role of N-AS in the dysfunction of microglia in AD.
C yclooxygenase2 (COX2), a major factor in inflammatory reactions
Interestingly, when COX2 is acetylated by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), the acetylated COX2 switches its catalytic activity to convert AA, EPA, and DHA to 15-HETE, 18-HEPE, and 17-HDHA, respectively
These molecules can be subsequently converted to 15R-lipoxin A4 (15R-LXA 4 ) and resolvins (Rv) E1, D1, D2, and D3, known as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), in the presence of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)
SPMs have potent pro-resolving actions, leading to cessation of immune cell infiltration, downregulation of pro-inflammatory and upregulation of anti-inflammatory mediators, and promotion of phagocytosis and tissue regeneration
Also, recent studies have reported that SPMs are reduced in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in dysfunction of microglia
However, the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of microglia via SPMs have not been identified in most neuroinflammatory diseases, including AD.
Sphingosine kinase1 (SphK1) is an ATP-dependent lipid kinase that catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
Recently, we demonstrated a role for SphK1 as an acetyl-CoA dependent cytoplasmic acetyltransferase with activity towards COX2
We also confirmed that neuronal SphK1 levels are reduced in AD brain, and that increased SphK1 promoted SPM secretion in neurons, especially 15R-LXA 4 , by acetylating serine residue 565 (S565) of COX2, resulting in improvement of AD-like pathology.
However, the biochemical and specific AD pathogenic mechanisms underlying SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation is not fully understood.
Here, we show that acetyl-CoA binds the ATP binding site in SphK1, and that reaction of acetyl-CoA and sphingosine within SphK1 generates N-acetyl sphingosine (N-AS).
N-AS produced by SphK1 binds COX2, and acetylates the S565, which corresponds to the residue we previously showed was acetylated by SphK1
N-AS-acetylated COX2 increases production of 15-HETE, 18-HEPE, and 17-HDHA, which can be subsequently converted to SPMs, and enhances SPM production, including 15R-LXA 4 , RvE1, and RvD1, similar to aspirin-acetylated COX2
Furthermore, N-AS generation was decreased in microglia of AD, leading to reduction of acetyl-S565 COX2 and N-AS-triggered SPMs.
These findings also led us to investigate the role of N-AS in AD microglia.
The treatment of APP/PS1 mice with N-AS increased N-AS-induced SPMs in microglia via S565 acetylation of COX2, resulting in the direct regulation of microglial function.
Finally, the N-AS-triggered SPMs led to resolution of neuroinflammation and upregulation of several reactive microglial genes linked to phagocytosis compared with untreated APP/PS1 microglia, leading to amelioration of AD pathology.
In addition, amyloid β (Aβ)-treated human microglia also showed reduction of N-AS generation, and N-AS treatment of these human cells improved SPM production and phagocytosis capacity as well.
Overall, these results reveal a biosynthetic mechanism and function of N-AS, which leads to S565 acetylation of COX2 and production of SPMs.
They also reveal the relation of N-AS with microglial regulation in AD pathogenesis, and suggest a potential therapy for neuroinflammatory diseases, such as AD, using N-AS or related derivatives that could be evaluated in the future.

Results
Residue S565 of COX2 is acetylated by N-AS.
To further study the role of N-AS as an intermediate in SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation, we performed a binding assay of N-AS to COX2.
Incorporation of N-AS to COX2 became saturated with increased concentrations of N-AS, yielding K M and K cat values of 35.48 μM and 0.51 min
We also measured the acetylation level of COX2 in the presence of [ 14 C] N-AS.
N-ASmediated COX2 acetylation displayed higher-level acetylation compared with aspirin or SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation (Fig.
These results indicated that N-AS, as an intermediate for SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation, had high binding affinity and induced high-level acetylation of COX2.
Next, to identify which site on COX2 was acetylated by N-AS, we treated N-AS with COX2.
From these studies we found that S565 on peptide 565-GCPFTSFSVPDPELIK-575 of COX2 was acetylated in the presence of N-AS, the same site that we found acetylated by SphK1 in our previous study
To further characterize acetylated S565 of COX2 by N-AS, we generated rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies, ac-S565.
Incubation of COX2 with N-AS led to strong ac-S565-positive signals in western blot analyses compared with naïve COX2 and aspirin-treated COX2 (Fig.
Projection of the acetylation site on the theoretical crystal structure of human COX2 showed that S565 was located on the catalytic domain of the enzyme
Based on the theoretical crystallographic model, we propose a possible mechanism of N-AS-acetylated COX2 in which acetyl transfer to S565 in the COX2 active site via N-AS was promoted by the hydrogen bonding of N181 and T564 with the acetyl group.
Additional hydrogen bonding of S567 with the C3 hydroxyl group appeared to further increase the binding affinity of N-AS (Fig.
To establish the validity of this mechanism, we mutated residues S565, N181, T564, and S567 of COX2 and performed kinetic and acetylation analysis.
The binding affinity and acetylation of COX2 were significantly decreased in the mutant COX2, including S565A, N181A, T564A, and S567A, compared with COX2 WT.
Interestingly, S565A showed the lowest binding affinity and acetylation level compared to the other mutants, suggesting that S565 is the main target site of N-AS-mediated COX2 acetylation (Fig.

N-AS induces production of SPMs by COX2 acetylation.
To investigate the production of SPMs by N-AS-acetylated COX2, we performed COX2 product profiling for AA, EPA, and DHA using recombinant COX2 treated with N-AS in the presence of 5-LOX (Supplementary Table
Consistent with previous studies, including ours
eover, the N-AS treated COX2 reduced PGs, such as PGH 2 (Supplementary Table
Next, several SPMs were identified using LC-MS/MS.
Interestingly, SPMs, including 15R-LXA 4 , RvE1, and RvD1, were produced by N-AS-acetylated COX2 (Fig.
The level of SPMs induced by N-AS exhibited a marked increase compared with those produced by COX2 without treatment, and was similar to those produced by aspirin (Fig.
To gain more direct insights into the relationship of N-AS-acetylated COX2 and SPM production, we verified the production of SPMs in the COX2 S565A mutant.
The S565A mutant led to considerably decreased production of SPMs after treatment of N-AS, although there were no differences after treatment with aspirin, indicating that S565 in N-AS-acetylated COX2 is important for production of SPMs (Fig.
erall, we confirmed that N-ASacetylated COX2 produced SPMs, suggesting the potential pathological role and therapeutic use of N-AS in inflammatory diseases, including AD.
Aβ induce loss of N-AS generation in neuron and microglia.
Previously, SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation was observed in neurons, and was found to be decreased in neurons derived from AD
To investigate the generation and roles of N-AS in CNS cells, primary culture of    neuron, microglia and astrocyte was prepared from C57BL/6 mice, and confirmed generation of N-AS in these cells.
N-AS was detected in neurons and microglia, but not in astrocytes (Fig.
Also, to investigate whether N-AS was correlated with the pathogenesis of AD, we treated cells with 10 μM Aβ.
The treatment with Aβ reduced N-AS generation in neurons and microglia, indicating the possible relationship of N-AS with neurons and microglia in AD (Fig.
Next, we assessed N-AS-acetylated COX2 in these cells using the ac-S565 antibodies.
Consistent with N-AS generation, N-AS-mediated acetyl-S565 COX2 was observed in both neurons and microglia, but not in astrocytes.
Further, these studies confirmed that in the presence of Aβ, the levels of N-AS-acetylated COX2 were decreased in both neurons and microglia (Fig.
These results indicated that N-AS was generated, and acetylated S565 of COX2 in neuron and microglia, which was abrogated with Aβ treatment.
They also indicated that astrocytes were not involved in this mechanism.
To further determine why the generation of N-AS was reduced in neurons and microglia treated with Aβ, we examined factors related to the generation of N-AS, including SphK activity, acetyl-CoA, and sphingosine.
SphK activity was decreased in Aβ-treated neurons compared with neurons without treatment, although there was no significant difference in microglia, similar to our previous study
By contrast, the levels of acetyl-CoA were significantly reduced in Aβ-treated microglia compared with microglia without treatment, but not in Aβ-treated neurons (Fig.
Sphingosine levels were unchanged by Aβ in these cells (Fig.
Interestingly, supplementation with SphK1 in Aβ-affected neurons enhanced N-AS generation, but not acetyl-CoA and sphingosine.
In contrast, in Aβ-affected microglia, the supplementation with acetyl-CoA improved N-AS generation, but not SphK1 and sphingosine (Fig.
In addition, S565 acetylation of COX2 and SPM expression, which were decreased in Aβ-treated neurons and microglia, improved after treatment with SphK1 and acetyl-CoA in Aβ-affected neurons and microglia, respectively, similar to restoration by treatment of N-AS (Fig.
These data showed that Aβ led to reduction of N-AS generation through the loss of SphK activity in neurons and the deficiency of acetyl-CoA in microglia, indicating different mechanisms for these two important cell types.
Overall, our results indicated that N-AS was generated, followed by S565 acetylation of COX2 and SPM expression, in neurons and microglia of the CNS.
This pathway was disrupted by different mechanisms in these two cell types upon exposure to Aβ. Notably, the levels of N-AS, acetyl-S565 COX2, and SPMs expression in microglia were higher than those in neurons, suggesting the generation and role of N-AS was more essential in microglia than neurons.
Finally, these results suggested that the reduced generation of N-AS might influence disease progression and/or pathogenesis in AD microglia, and might be treated by N-AS supplementation.
Generation and function of N-AS is reduced in AD microglia.
Next, to assess the generation and roles of N-AS in AD pathogenesis, we first determined N-AS generation in microglia and neurons derived from WT mice and APP/PS1 mice.
N-AS was detected in microglia and neurons derived from WT mice, and decreased in those derived from APP/PS1 mice compared with WT mice (Fig.
Specificity of ac-S565 COX2 immunoreactivity was also observed in microglia and neurons of WT mice, and significantly reduced in microglia and neurons of APP/PS1 mice compared with WT mice (Fig.
Consistent with CNS cell studies above, the levels of N-AS and acetyl-S565 COX2 were higher in microglia than in neurons, suggesting N-AS-acetylated COX2 was more active in microglia than in neuron.
These results indicated that N-AS might play important roles in microglia of AD.
In addition, to assess the influence of N-AS in AD pathogenesis, we injected N-AS daily subcutaneously (s.c.) for 8 weeks to 7-months-old APP/ PS1 mice until the age of 9 months (Fig.
In APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS, the levels of N-AS and N-AS-mediated COX2 acetylation were more restored in microglia of APP/PS1 mice compared with those in neurons (Fig.
These data indicated that microglia were the likely target cells responsible for AD pathogenesis via N-AS.
To further investigate why AD pathology was more dependent on N-AS in microglia compared to neurons, we first assessed expression of COX2 in microglia and neurons.
COX2 expression was significantly increased in APP/PS1 microglia compared with WT microglia beginning at 5 months of age.
In contrast to the microglia, no significant differences in COX2 expression was observed in neurons (Supplementary Fig.
Next, to confirm whether N-AS was bound to and acetylated COX2 in the APP/ PS1 microglia and neurons, we isolated microglia and neurons after [ 14 C] N-AS administration to WT and APP/PS1 mice, and checked [ 14 C] radioreactivity of COX2 purified from these cells.
We found that [ 14 C] N-AS was more avidly bound to and acetylated COX2 of APP/PS1 microglia compared with COX2 in WT microglia; no significant differences were observed in neurons (Supplementary Fig.
These results indicated that the high COX2 expression of microglia might be prone to increased binding and acetylation by N-AS compared with that in neurons in APP/PS1 mice.
Finally, to assess the ability of N-AS-acetylated COX2 to produce SPMs in microglia of APP/PS1 mice, we performed lipidomic profiling analysis in microglia derived from WT, APP/ PS1, and APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS (Supplementary Table
The SPM precursors, including 15-HETE, 18-HEPE, and 17-HDHA, were decreased in APP/PS1 microglia versus WT microglia.
However, microglia derived from APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS had levels that were restored to those of WT Fig.
The binding velocity (V binding ) of [ 14 C] N-AS to COX2 was plotted to the N-AS concentration and the nonlinear regression analysis of the saturated plot yielded the kinetic parameters such as K cat (catalytic constant) and K M (Michaelis-Menten constant) for N-AS and COX2 binding activity (n = 3 independent experiments per group).
b Acetylation assay of purified COX2 protein treated with [ 14 C] N-AS.
The purified COX2 protein incubated in the presence of [ 14 C] N-AS for 2 h at 37 °C and then COX2 was analyzed on scintillation counter.
[ 14 C] aspirin-treated COX2 protein and [ 14 C] acetyl-CoA treated COX2 protein with SphK1 and sphingosine were positive control (n = 6-9 per group).

e Recombinant COX2 protein was incubated in the presence or absence of 2 mM N-AS or aspirin as indicated and S565 acetylation was determined by western blotting using anti-ac-S565 and COX2 antibodies.
Data were replicated in six independent experiments with similar results.
f The theoretical crystallographic model of human COX2 structure was taken from Protein Data Bank file 1V0X.
S565 and residues (N181, T564, and S567) involved in the catalysis of COX2 were projected on the crystal structure of COX2 using PyMOL.
Residues are shown as well: (1) S565 (red); (2) N181, T564, and S567 (green).
g Proposed mechanism for the acetylation of S565 of COX2 by N-AS.
h Acetylation assay of COX2 WT, COX2 S565A, COX2 N181A, COX2 T564A, and COX2 S567A treated with [
Consistent with these observations, the SPMs themselves, such as 15R-LXA 4 , RvE1, and RvD1, exhibited a marked decrease in microglia derived from APP/PS1 mice compared with microglia derived from WT mice.
These levels were restored in microglia derived from APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS (Supplementary Fig.
Taken together, these results demonstrated that N-AS generation was mainly decreased in microglia of APP/PS1 mice, which resulted in reduced acetyl-S565 COX2 and SPM expression, and N-AS treatment led to potent anti-inflammatory actions by inducing N-AS-triggered SPMs via S565 acetylation of COX2.
N-AS-triggered SPMs regulate microglial characterization.
To investigate the direct effect of N-AS-triggered SPMs on microglial regulation, we first examined microglial activation by determining the activities of pro-inflammatory (CD86)
The CD206 -CD86 + pro-inflammatory microglia were reduced, and the CD206 + CD86 -anti-inflammatory microglia were abundant in APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS compared with APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle, indicating that N-ASinduced SPMs improved the anti-inflammatory activity of microglia in APP/PS1 mice (Fig.
Next, to further examine the regulation of microglia by N-AStriggered SPMs, we analyzed the gene expression patterns of microglia derived from WT, APP/PS1, and N-AS-injected APP/PS1 mice using RNA seq.
Comparative RNA seq analysis revealed that APP/PS1 microglia expressed high levels of genes that induced an inflammatory response (e.g., Spp1, Itgax, Axl, Lilrb4a, Clec7a, Ccl2, Csf1, and Apoe) and suppressed homeostatic genes (e.g., Fa2h, Cidea, Neurod1, Gck, Epor, and Atp7b) compared with WT microglia (with <2 Z-score and P < 0.05).
These results confirmed the characteristics of the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype of APP/PS1 mice determined in previous studies
Interestingly, microglia derived from APP/ PS1 mice treated with N-AS showed upregulation of several reactive microglial genes (e.g., Rap1gap, Tub, Mex3b, Appl2, Adam8, and Megf10) linked to phagocytosis and downregulation of inflammatory and immune molecules (e.g., Spp1, Itgax, Axl, Lilrb4a, Clec7a, Ccl2, Csf1, and Apoe) compared with microglia derived from APP/PS1 treated with vehicle, indicating improvement of the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype of APP/PS1 mice (Fig.
Furthermore, functional categorization using the DAVID bioinformatics database for GO term enrichment analysis (biological process and molecular function) demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes in microglia of N-AS-treated APP/ PS1 mice compared with APP/PS1 mice were strongly associated with an inflammatory response, immune response, and phagocytosis (Fig.
KEGG pathway analysis identified a considerable enrichment of genes involved in phagocytosis (e.g., lysosome and phagosome) and immune response (e.g., cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway) (Fig.
These results indicated that N-AS-triggered SPMs activated an anti-inflammatory, positive immune response, and enhanced the phagocytic abilities of microglia in N-AS-treated APP/PS1 mice, leading to resolution of neuroinflammation and upregulation of phagocytic microglia in this AD animal model.

SPMs regulate microglial phagocytosis and immune response.
Based on RNA seq results, we next examined whether the enhancement of phagocytic microglia resulted from N-AStriggered SPMs and promoted Aβ phagocytosis in N-AS-treated APP/PS1 mice.
First, to determine whether N-AS-triggered SPMs restored microglial recruitment to Aβ, we quantified the number of microglia surrounding the plaques, and found that microglial recruitment was increased in APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS compared to APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle (Fig.
We next performed a phagocytosis assay using live brain slices of WT, APP/ PS1 mice injected with vehicle and APP/PS1 injected with N-AS mice.
More phagocytic microglia were found in APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS compared to APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle, using a fluorescent bead phagocytosis assay (Fig.
To further investigate this effect, the Aβ phagocytic activity of microglia was evaluated in APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle and APP/PS1 treated with N-AS mice.
APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS showed demonstrably increased number of microglia containing co-stained lysosomes and Aβ compared to APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle (Supplementary Fig.
Also, we performed morphological characterization of microglia surrounding Aβ in APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle and APP/PS1 treated with N-AS mice, and found that the phagocytic morphology (ameboid microglial morphology) was more evident in APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS than APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle, indicating increased Aβ phagocytosis (Supplementary Fig.
Next because the immunohistochemistry analysis could not functionally distinguish between increased phagocytosis and impaired degradation, we analyzed the expression of Aβ degrading enzymes, including neprilysin (NEP), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and insulindegrading enzyme (IDE), in WT, APP/PS1 mice injected with vehicle and APP/PS1 injected with N-AS mice.
These enzymes remained unchanged between the groups, whereas CD36, which is known to be increased in phagocytic microglia
Finally, in Aβ plaque morphometric analysis, APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS, rather than APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle, showed significantly increased number of small (<25 μm) plaques, and a significant reduction of medium (25-50 μm) and large-sized (>50 μm) plaques, indicating that the outer parts of the Aβ aggregates was phagocytosed by microglia (Supplementary Fig.
Overall, these results demonstrated that N-AS-triggered SPMs elevated the phagocytic capacity of microglia, and enhanced the microglial Aβ phagocytic function in APP/PS1 mice.
SPMs can stimulate the resolution of inflammation by regulating immune cells, such as limiting neutrophil infiltration and enhancing the clearance of debris by macrophages
To identify the effects of N-AS-triggered SPMs by microglia on the immune system, we also examined brain and blood immune cells in WT, APP/PS1 and APP/PS1 injected with N-AS mice.
The APP/PS1 mice showed increased infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and CD4 + T cells into the brain compared with WT mice (Fig.
Elevated levels of macrophages, pro-inflammatory monocytes, and CD4 + T cells, and decreased levels of antiinflammatory monocytes were also present in blood of APP/PS1 mice compared with WT (Supplementary Fig.
These blood-derived immune cells might be promoted by Aβ, and have been shown to contribute to disease pathogenesis
Interestingly, the numbers of proinflammatory macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils were reduced, and the numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages, which would facilitate clearance of cerebral Aβ, were increased in the brains of N-AS-treated APP/PS1 mice compared with vehicletreated APP/PS1 mice (Fig.
Further, the decreased macrophages and pro-inflammatory monocytes, and increased antiinflammatory monocytes, were also observed in the blood of N-AS-treated APP/PS1 mice compared with vehicle-treated APP/ PS1 mice, although neutrophils showed no differences between the groups (Supplementary Fig.
These results indicated that Fig.

N-AS-triggered SPMs in microglia positively regulated the immune system of brain and blood, although lymphocytes, such as CD4 + T cells and B220 + B cells, did not change.
Our results supported the concept that N-AS-triggered SPMs modulated microglial Aβ phagocytic function and resolved neuroinflammation via regulation of the immune system, suggesting the potential therapeutic possibilities of N-AS as a direct microglial regulator and immunomodulator in neuroinflammatory diseases, including AD.
N-AS-triggered SPMs improve AD pathology in APP/PS1 mice.
Finally, to determine whether microglia regulation by
In APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and tau hyperphosphorylation also were reduced (Fig.
Moreover, the inflammatory response was improved in the APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS compared to APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle (Fig.
Overall, these data indicated that N-ASinduced SPMs reduced Aβ plaque burden and neuroinflammation via upregulating phagocytic microglia and positive regulation of the immune response.
Next, to investigate neuropathology improvement by microglia regulation of N-AS-triggered SPMs, we performed immunolabeling for synaptophysin, MAP2, synapsin1, and PSD95 in WT, APP/PS1, and N-AS-treated APP/PS1 mice.
The labeling densities of synaptophysin, MAP2, synapsin1, and PSD95 were reduced in APP/PS1 mice compared with those in WT mice, However, the expression levels of synaptophysin, MAP2, synapsin1, and PSD95 were restored in APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS compared with those in APP/PS1 mice (Supplementary Fig.
We also performed the Morris water maze test and fear conditioning in WT, APP/PS1 injected with vehicle and APP/PS1 injected with N-AS mice to examine changes in learning and memory.
The APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle showed severe deficits in memory formation, while APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS were largely protected from this defect (Fig.
For locomotion and spontaneous activity, open field and light-dark tests were used.
APP/PS1 mice treated with N-AS showed improved locomotion and spontaneous activity in the open field test compared with APP/PS1 mice, although the light-dark test did not differ between the groups (Supplementary Fig.
These results showed that N-AStriggered SPMs restored neuropathology and led to behavioral improvement in APP/PS1, which might be caused by increased Aβ phagocytosis via N-AS-treated microglia.
However, apoptosis was not changed in the N-AS treated APP/PS1 mice compared with the vehicle treated APP/PS1 mice, although N-AS has been used extensively to induce apoptosis of tumors
Unlike nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin
To confirm the findings above, we repeated these studies in another mouse model of AD, 5×FAD mice, and found that N-AS treatment similarly improved AD pathology of 5×FAD mice, including Aβ plaque deposit, Aβ plaque phagocytosis, neuroinflammation, and synapse activity (Supplementary Fig.
Collectively, these results indicated that N-AS treatment attenuated AD pathology by regulating microglia via N-AS-triggered SPMs, but not by inducing apoptosis and decreasing COX2 expression.

Discussion
Here, we investigated the specific mechanism of SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation, which led to production of SPMs and resolution of neuroinflammation in microglia of AD.
In SphK1mediated COX2 acetylation, acetyl-CoA bound the ATP binding pocket of SphK1, and the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA was transferred to sphingosine, resulting in the generation of N-AS.
In turn, N-AS then acetylated residue S565 of COX2, forming an intermediate between SphK1 and COX2.
N-AS-acetylated COX2 led to production of SPMs, including 15R-LXA 4 , RvE1, and RvD1, in the presence of 5-LOX, suggesting the potential pathological roles and therapeutic use of N-AS in inflammatory diseases (Supplementary Fig.
Interestingly, we demonstrated that the reduction of N-AS generation is found mainly in microglia of the AD brain, leading to decreased acetyl-S565 COX2 and SPM production.
The decreased N-AS-triggered SPMs caused failure of neuroinflammatory resolution and reduced phagocytosis ability, leading to an increase in immune cell trafficking and plaque burden, which exacerbated AD pathology.
Moreover, N-AS administration into AD mice increased N-AStriggered SPMs by S565 acetylation of COX2, especially in microglia, resulting in increase of phagocytic microglia.
The phagocytic microglia led to resolution of neuroinflammation and an increase of Aβ phagocytosis, ameliorating AD pathology (Supplementary Fig.
Collectively, our findings establish a biosynthetic mechanism and role of N-AS in AD pathogenesis, and established "proof-of-concept" for N-AS treatment in neuroinflammatory diseases including AD.
We previously demonstrated the role of neuronal SphK1acetyltransferase activity on COX2 and showed that it was reduced in AD neurons, exacerbating AD pathology
However, the mechanism of SphK1-mediated COX2 acetylation remained poorly understood, as well as its role in the pathogenesis of AD.
In this study, we established N-AS as intermediate of SphK1mediated COX2 acetylation.
The N-AS was generated in neurons and microglia, which was abrogated by Aβ in the AD environment.
The reduction of N-AS generation in AD neurons was caused by decreased SphK1 activity, while reduced N-AS synthesis in AD microglia was caused by deficient acetyl-CoA.
Of note, a reduction of acetyl-CoA was previously found to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity, through oxidative damage by Aβ in the brains of AD 2576Tg and 3xTg mice, leading to defected microglia
However, the correlation of microglia dysfunction Fig.

Although there is extensive literature supporting the importance of microglial regulation
The SPMs, such as RvD1 and LXA 4 , play an important role in the maintenance of phagocytic microglia
Further, in a previous study, we reported the loss of SphK1 activity and reduced SPM secretion in AD neurons, which led to defective microglial phagocytosis and dysfunction of inflammation resolution
In this study, our results showed that N-AS was mainly observed in microglia of N-AS-treated APP/PS1 mice rather than neurons, and directly regulated microglia via N-AStriggered SPMs.
The N-AS-triggered SPMs derived from microglia upregulated several reactive microglial genes linked to We also confirmed that N-AS-triggered SPMs derived from microglia resolves neuroinflammation via regulation of the immune system, similar to the function of SPMs reported in previous studies
Furthermore, we confirmed that N-AStriggered SPMs produced from microglia directly mediate the effects seen after administration of N-AS.
When 5-LOX inhibitor, zileuton, was incubated with N-AS in Aβ-treated human microglia, the production of N-AS-triggered SPMs and restoration of phagocytic capacity was inhibited, indicating that N-AS-triggered SPMs directly mediate the positive effects in microglia.
However, because the zileuton also reduce formation of leukotriene (e.g., LTB 4 ) and prostaglandin (e.g., PGE 2 ) production
Our results showed that zileuton treatment reduced PGE 2 , as well as SPMs, although LTB 4 was not detected.
Both SPMs and PGE 2 , which decreased by zileuton, play an important role in phagocytic ability of microglia, and phagocytosis is restored through the increase of SPMs production and inhibition of PGE 2 synthesis
In our study, although the levels of PGE 2 were decreased, the phagocytic ability was not restored by N-AS in Aβ-treated microglia with zileuton.
These results suggest the N-AS-triggered SPMs, rather than the other lipid mediators, were more responsible direct regulation of microglia including phagocytosis in AD environment.
Notably, N-AStriggered SPMs, as well as N-AS generation and acetyl-S565 COX2, in microglia were higher than those in neurons, suggesting that the N-AS-triggered SPMs derived from microglia might play an important role rather than those derived from neurons.
Collectively, these results indicated that direct microglial regulation via N-AS-triggered SPMs derived from microglia might be more responsible for AD pathogenesis than indirect regulation of microglia thorough neurons, suggesting N-AS-triggered SPMs derived from microglia as direct regulators of pathology in AD.
In AD diagnosis, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging procedures are used for detecting Aβ and tau material when molecular aggregates are deposited in the brain at high concentration in the late stages of AD pathology.
However, it is very difficult to diagnosis the disease before the protein aggregates
The neuroinflammation in the AD pathology starts at very early stages, most likely before amyloid plaques are formed, suggesting it may be a promising therapeutic target and useful in the diagnosis of AD at preclinical stages
In fact, use of radiolabeled translocator protein (TSPO, first described as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) ligands to quantify the expression of the microglial TSPO receptor has been applied for the diagnosis of neuroinflammation
Similar to radiolabeled TSPO ligands, N-AS might be considered to diagnose neuroinflammation in early AD stages, in addition to its potential therapeutic use, based on two results: (1) In PK profiling of N-AS, a high concentration of N-AS was maintained in plasma and brain, and N-AS had highdistribution to the brain; and (2) N-AS had high binding affinity and induced high-level acetylation of the elevated COX2, prior to observing Aβ deposits in APP/PS1 microglia.
Despite the potential of N-AS as a therapeutic, it is also important to recognize that this therapeutic use of N-AS may be limited by its poor solubility and low BA.
There is also the potential of N-AS to induce apoptosis, which has been found in other studies
Therefore, additional studies are warranted to investigate derivatives of N-AS that might be potentially useful for neuroinflammatory diseases including AD.

Methods
Molecular docking.
Molecular modeling studies were performed using Discovery Studio Programs (2018, Accelrys) and figures were generated using PyMOL programs.
The 3D coordinates of human SphK1 complexed with ADP were obtained from the protein data bank for docking studies (PDB entry 3VZD).
3VZD represents a tetrameric crystal structure of SphK1 that includes six monomers (A-F).
Monomer C was chosen for the simulations based on its displacement property.
ADP, which binds between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, was removed from the complex.
Preparation of the protein was performed with the Prepare Protein protocol and a binding site was created using the Define and Edit Binding Site protocol (default parameters were used).
Energy minimization of ligands was performed by the Clean Geometry module in Discovery Studio, and conformations were generated using the Generate Conformations protocol and the Best method (other parameters were kept at the default values).
Top ten conformations with the highest degree of similarity to ADP were chosen for docking simulation.
Docking of the ligands (acetyl-CoA, sphingosine, and ATP) was performed using the CDOCKER protocol, and analysis of ligand interactions at the binding site was performed using the ligand Interactions tool followed by visual inspection.
S1P assays.
We confirmed S1P formation through SphK1 enzymatic activity measurements as previously described 11 using a UPLC (Ultra performance liquid chromatography) system (Waters).
Briefly, 3 μl of SphK1 (Cayman, 10348) were mixed with 3 μl of assay buffer (200 μM NBD-sphingosine (Avanti Polar Lipids), 100 mM of HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 200 mM Semicarbazide, 1 mM 4-deoxpyridoxin, 2 mM Dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Igepal CA-630, all from Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of 0-50 mM acetyl-CoA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2056), and the mixture were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min.
After pre-incubation, 1 mM ATP (Amresco, 0220) was added the mixture, and it was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.
The hydrolysis reactions were stopped by adding 53 μl of ethanol, and centrifuged at 15,493×g for 5 min.
Thirty microliter of the supernatant was then transferred to a sampling glass vial and 5 μl was applied onto a UPLC system for analysis.
S1P formation was followed as phosphorylation of (7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-d-erythro Fig.

Briefly, in a glass bottom cell culture dish (SPL, 101350), adult SV40 immortalized human microglia cells (Applied Biologics Materials, T0251) were seeded for phagocytosis assay.
The seeded cells were incubated with 0 or 50 μM Aβ (Invitrogen, 03112) at 37 °C for 24 h, before treated with 0 or 50 μM zileuton (Sigma-Aldrich, Z4277) at 37 °C for 24 h.
After incubation, the microglia were treated with 0 or 2.5 μM N-AS (Sigma-Aldrich, 01912) at 37 °C for 2 h.
FITC beads (Invitrogen) preopsonized in FBS (Gibco) were added at a concentration at 0.01% and then immediately observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a live cell chamber system (FV3000, Olympus) for 2 h.
Confocal images were collected every 5 min for 2 h and analyzed using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).
Statistical analysis.
Sample sizes were determined by G-Power software (with α = 0.05 and power of 0.8).
In general, statistical methods were not used to recalculate or predetermine sample sizes.
Variance was similar within comparable experimental groups.
Experimenters were blinded to the identity of experimental groups until the end of data collection and analysis for at least one of the independent experiments.
Comparisons between two groups were performed with Student's t-test.
In cases where more than two groups were compared to each other, a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Tukey's HSD test.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software and Graph-Pad Prism 7.0 software.
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001 were considered to be significant.

d LC-MS/MS spectra of ac-S565 in 560-GCPFTSFSVPDPELIK-575 of COX2.
e Recombinant COX2 protein was incubated in the presence or absence of 2 mM N-AS or aspirin as indicated and S565 acetylation was determined by western blotting using anti-ac-S565 and COX2 antibodies.
Data were replicated in six independent experiments with similar results.
f The theoretical crystallographic model of human COX2 structure was taken from Protein Data Bank file 1V0X.
S565 and residues (N181, T564, and S567) involved in the catalysis of COX2 were projected on the crystal structure of COX2 using PyMOL.
Residues are shown as well: (1) S565 (red); (2) N181, T564, and S567 (green).

and acetyl-CoA metabolism has not been fully understood.
In our study, decreased N-AS generation by deficient acetyl-CoA in AD microglia induced reduction of COX2 acetylation and SPM expression, resulting in neurodegenerative microglia.
Based on previous studies and our results, we propose that deficient acetyl-CoA metabolism by Aβ destroys microglia in AD through reduction of N-AS generation.
