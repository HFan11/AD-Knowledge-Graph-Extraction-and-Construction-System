An In Vitro Model to Investigate the Role of Helicobacter pylori in Type 2 Diabetes, Obesity, Alzheimer’s Disease and Cardiometabolic Disease
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a Gram-negative bacterium colonizing the human stomach.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of intracellular human gastric carcinoma cells (MKN-28) incubated with the Hp cell filtrate (Hpcf ) displays high levels of amino acids, including the branched chain amino acids (BCAA) isoleucine, leucine, and valine.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Array Technology shows upregulation of mammalian Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1), inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
The review of literature indicates that these traits are common to type 2 diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's diseases, and cardiometabolic disease.
Here, we demonstrate how Hp may modulate these traits.
Hp induces high levels of amino acids, which, in turn, activate mTORC1, which is the complex regulating the metabolism of the host.
A high level of BCAA and upregulation of mTORC1 are, thus, directly regulated by Hp.
Furthermore, Hp modulates inflammation, which is functional to the persistence of chronic infection and the asymptomatic state of the host.
Finally, in order to induce autophagy and sustain bacterial colonization of gastric mucosa, the Hp toxin VacA localizes within mitochondria, causing fragmentation of these organelles, depletion of ATP, and oxidative stress.
In conclusion, our in vitro disease model replicates the main traits common to the above four diseases and shows how Hp may potentially manipulate them.

Introduction
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a Gram-negative bacterium colonizing the human gastric mucosa.
It is transmitted orally, often within the family.
Colonizing about one half of the world's population, Hp, can be classified as one of the most successful human pathogens
Genetic diversity and efficient evasion of host innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to this success
Genetic diversity of Hp originates from a high mutation rate, and is favored by the absence of a DNA mismatch repair mechanism and acquisition of DNA from other strains
The Hp lipopolysaccharide escapes binding by antimicrobial peptides and detection by Tool-like receptors (TLRs) by removing phosphate groups from the lipid A
VacA modulates T-cell proliferation by inhibiting nuclear translocation of the T transcription factor NF-AT
Hp can persist for decades asymptomatically, but carriers are at risk of developing gastritis, duodenal ulcers, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or gastric adenocarcinoma.
Finally, epidemiological studies suggest that Hp may cause extra gastric diseases
Often, bacteria colonize the host by exploiting its metabolism
For this purpose, Hp uses mTORC1, which is the complex sensing the conditions for cellular survival.
mTORC1 is active when nutrients are abundant, and inactive when they are scarce
In the early phase of host colonization, the Hp toxin VacA inhibits mTORC1 expression and activates autophagy to gain the nutrients needed to colonize the gastric mucosa
Once this phase is terminated, autophagy would obstruct the chronic infection.
To prevent this condition, CagA (a toxin antagonistic to VacA) activates mTORC1
The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine, and valine, together with insulin, actively participate to mTORC1 activation
Hp, through a clever use of two antagonistic toxins, modulates mTORC1 and, consequently, the metabolism of its host.
Furthermore, in order to induce autophagy and sustain colonization of gastric mucosa, VacA localizes within the mitochondria by causing mitochondrial DNA mutations in the gastric cells, mitochondrial fragmentation, depletion of ATP, and oxidative stress
Finally, to facilitate chronic infection and persistence of the host asymptomatic state, Hp modulates inflammation.
However, this unstable equilibrium often fails.
Inflammation is the most frequent cause of the passage from the asymptomatic state to that of disease
We just described how upregulation of mTORC1, high levels of BCAA, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunctions characterize Hp infection.
According to current literature, the same traits characterize the metabolic diseases known as type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity (OB), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cardiometabolic disease (CMD)
It seemed, therefore, feasible to investigate whether Hp may potentially predispose to the above diseases.
Epidemiological studies have several limitations.
They require the enrollment of a large number of patients, and known and unknown confounding factors make results difficult to replicate
Analysis of the cellular metabolic profile of in vitro cultured cells has detected yeast mutants that conventional methods failed to identify
Inspired by these results, we tested whether nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics and microarray analysis of the human gastric carcinoma cells MKN-28, incubated for 2 h with the Hp cell filtrate (Hpcf ), might identify the traits that current literature recognizes as biomarkers of patients with one of the four diseases listed above.
MKN-28 incubated with Hpcf showed high levels of BCAA, upregulation of mTORC1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation.
Here, we show that these traits are all referable, at least in part, to Hp.

Results

NMR-Based Metabolomics Analysis
The in vitro metabolic effects of Hpcf on the MKN-28 cells were investigated by performing NMR-based intracellular and extracellular metabolomics analysis of the MKN-28 cells.
Intracellular analysis compared MKN-28 cells incubated and not with the Hpcf of the culture medium used to grow Hp.
We first applied the unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to verify the homogeneity of samples and then the supervised orthogonal projection to latent structure analysis (OPLS-DA) to
In particular, the extracts of MKN-28 cells incubated with Hpcf are placed at t
To discriminate between the two groups of samples, we used the NMR loadings plot variables with correlation loading values |p(corr)| > 0.7 (Figure
Cells incubated with Hpcf when compared with non-incubated cells show higher levels of the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamate, proline, leucine, alanine, valine, and isoleucine, the short chain fatty acids acetate and propionate, saturated fatty acids, sialic acid, and lower levels of taurine (Figures

Helicobacter Pylori Alters the Amino Acids Metabolism
The literature describes a study where two independent cohorts with each consisting of more than 3000 normoglycemic participants being followed for 12 years.
High plasma levels of BCAA, and of the two aromatic amino acids (AAA) tyrosine and phenylalanine (out of 60 metabolites) could predict the development of T2D in the enrolled participants as early as 12 years in advance from the onset of the disease
Numerous independent studies confirm the association of high plasma levels of BCAA with T2D
Incubated with Hpcf for 2 h, the human MKN-28 gastric cells show altered expression levels of 13 metabolites (Figures
These findings, obtained using cells cultured in vitro, replicate the results of the studies carried out on humans and cited above.
Furthermore, a recent longitudinal study carried out on a large Japanese population demonstrates that, in addition to the above amino acids, alanine and proline, which are positively associated with visceral fat deposition, while glycine is negatively associated
Our study replicates these results (Figure
The probability that seven out of the 20 (0.35) amino acids upregulated in the studies reported above, and, in the present one, are instead upregulated by chance at 8 × 10 -8 .
Mammals lack the enzymes needed for the synthesis of BCAA
The increased plasma levels of BCAA detected in patients with T2D or OB may result from two potential mechanisms.
One claims that an excess of dietary BCAA activates the mTORC1 complex.
The alternative mechanism suggests that high levels of BCAA alter the metabolism by causing mitochondrial dysfunction of pancreatic islet β cells
MKN-28 cells incubated with Hpcf display upregulation of mTORC1 and mitochondrial dysfunction (Table
Therefore, these data indicate that cell culture may fruitfully be used to investigate whether Hp influences apparently different diseases.
Zucker-obese rats display lower muscle glycine levels compared to Zucker-lean rats.
However, when Zucker-obese rats are fed on a BCAA-restricted diet, their muscle glycine levels become normal.
These results argue that BCAA metabolism may somehow interfere with that of glycine and, at the same time, give plausibility to the negative association of glycine with BCAA reported above.
BCAA and glutamate are the two pathways more often altered in patients with AD
High levels of isoleucine are associated with AD and high levels of valine are associated with reduced risk of AD.
The latter result has been confirmed in the longitudinal Rotterdam study
BCAA cross the blood-brain barrier through the large neutral amino acid transporter LAT1 in competition with AAA
When the plasma level of BCAA is chronically elevated, BCAA uptake in the brain is favored at the expense of tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin and a molecule with multiple functions.
It reduces amyloid-β (Aβ) production (the hallmark of AD), protects neural survival, and stabilizes the mood
Furthermore, the enzyme-branched chain amino acid transaminase (BCAT) converts BCAA to glutamate.
Heightened levels of glutamate cause neuronal death by excitotoxicity (nerve cells death by glutamate overactivation).
Finally, mTORC1 activation and mitochondrial dysfunction have a role in AD.
The former enhances the tau-induced neurodegeneration, and apoptosis of post-mitotic neurons while the latter provokes Aβ plaque formation
In conclusion, high levels of isoleucine, valine, and glutamate (Figure
Of note, the convergent dysmetabolism (high levels of isoleucine, valine, and glutamate) common to T2D, OB, and AD is confirmed by the efficacy in AD patients of drugs used to treat T2D and other metabolic diseases
In addition to T2D, OB, and AD, recently high levels of BCAA have also been shown to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart failure
Studies in a mouse model have demonstrated that accumulation of BCAA requires inhibition of the BCAA-degradation-gene Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15).
The subsequent intra-myocardial accumulation of BCAA upregulates mTORC1 that activates protein synthesis, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure.
In a mouse model, pharmacologically induced BCAA catabolism significantly re-establishes the cardiac function
Significantly, suppression of BCAA catabolism and accumulation of BCAA have also been observed in humans with heart failure.
With regard to mitochondrial function, accumulation of lipids in the heart and hyperglycemia lead to impaired mitochondrial phosphorylation

MKN-28 Cells Uptake BCAA from Culture Medium
The four diseases listed above have high levels of BCAA as a common feature.
Mammalian cells as well as Hp cannot synthesize essential amino acids (which include BCAA).
To shed light on the origin of the high levels of BCAAs observed in our experiments, we tested the hypothesis that they may derive from the depletion of culture medium by the MKN-28 cells.
Following incubation with Hpcf, the MKN-28 cells display increased concentration of BCAA, while the extracellular medium shows reduced concentration of BCAA (Figure
Since both Hp and MKN-28 cells are auxotrophic for essential amino acids, the above interpretation seems plausible.

Helicobacter Pylori Induces Inflammation and Oxidative Stress
Hp infection induces inflammation via activation of NF-kB.
In our study, cell inflammation is confirmed by the upregulation of the IL-8, TNF-α, Il-6, TLR2, and TLR9 genes expressed by the MKN-28 cells incubated with Hpcf (Table
These cytokines characterize Hp infection and are part of a panel validated to detect inflammation in patients with chronic diseases
If not controlled, inflammation may damage the gastric cells.
In our study, we find several metabolites controlling the inflammation triggered by Hp.
Taurine curbs the excess of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mitochondria
The reduced level of this metabolite (Figure
One more signature in the same direction is sialic acid, expressed at a high level (Figure
This metabolite assists the immune system to discriminate between the self and non-self
Inflammation is also regulated by intracellular (acetate and propionate) and the extracellular (lactate) metabolites (Figure
Acetate and propionate modulate the gastric mucosa inflammation
Lactate, the product of the catabolism of glucose under anaerobic conditions, induces expression of anti-inflammatory genes, and promotes macrophage polarization
High levels of BCAAs (Figure
PCR array technology displayed upregulation of the main genes involved in the cell oxidative stress (Table
In particular, upregulation of SOD2, and downregulation of SOD1, point out the involvement of mitochondria in the production of ROS (Figure
Mitochondrial dysfunction is further confirmed by the high level of glutamate, which is tightly correlated with mitochondrial stress
dysfunction is further confirmed by the high level of glutamate, which is tightly correlated with mitochondrial stress
BCAA are required for the activation of mTORC1
PCR array technology showed upregulation of both the RPTOR and MLST8 subunits of mTORC1 after 2 h of Hpcf treatment, with key genes implicated in the regulation of the mTORC1 (AKT1, AKT2, INSR, IRS1, PLD1, and RPS6KA2) being significantly up-regulated (p-value ≤ 0.0001).
Significantly, upregulated genes include AKT1involved in the inhibition of protein breakdown-and INSR-sensing the concentration of insulin outside the cell and transmits this signal through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway
Finally, mTORC1 activation is confirmed by the overexpression of the positive effectors CHUK, EIF4E, and HIF1A (Table
We can conclude that high levels of BCAA (Figure

Discussion
Cellular homeostasis is heavily dependent upon a balanced regulation of mTORC1.
Thus, deregulation of this complex inevitably leads to many diseases, including metabolic diseases.
Though mTORC1 can be modulated by several factors, amino acids are condition necessary and sufficient for promoting cellular anabolic metabolism and mTORC1 activation
Upon incubation with Hpcf, MKN-28 cells show high levels of amino acids (Figure
This result, also observed in the AGS human cell line, reflects the demand of nutrients by Hp
At the same time, it displays the tight connection linking mTORC1 activation, high amino acids concentrations, and Hp infection.
In the absence of inflammation, immune cells exploit an anabolic metabolism modulated by mTORC1 tempered by c-MYC.
In the presence of inflammation, c-MYC is suppressed and mTORC1 moves under the control of HIF1α
This finding indicates that cell replication and inflammation both depend upon mTORC1, but are regulated by c-MYC in the absence of inflammation and H1F1α in the presence of inflammation.
In addition of inducing anabolic metabolism, inflammation inhibits AMPK, which is the activator of catabolic metabolism
In our study, upregulation of HIF1α and mTORC1 indicates that MKN-28 cells, upon incubation with Hpcf, express the mTORC1-HIF1α- BCAA are required for the activation of mTORC1
PCR array technology showed up-regulation of both the RPTOR and MLST8 subunits of mTORC1 after 2 h of Hpcf treatment, with key genes implicated in the regulation of the mTORC1 (AKT1, AKT2, INSR, IRS1, PLD1, and RPS6KA2) being significantly up-regulated (p-value ≤ 0.0001).
Significantly, upregulated genes include AKT1-involved in the inhibition of protein breakdown-and INSR-sensing the concentration of insulin outside the cell and transmits this signal through the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway

In our study, upregulation of HIF1α and mTORC1 indicates that MKN-28 cells, upon incubation with Hpcf, express the mTORC1-HIF1α-regulated inflammatory phenotype (Table
Induction of TNF-α and IL-6 (Table
Enhanced glycolysis via activation of PIK3 subunits and mTORC1-HIF1α (Table
Activation of MKN-28 cells by Hpcf and expression of the genes modulating mTORC1-HIF1α are one more proof of the tight connection between Hp and mTORC1 activation.
As a supervisor of host cell nourishment, mTORC1 is also the target of bacteria.
To establish infection, bacteria often need to shift the host cellular metabolism from anabolic to catabolic.
Inhibition of mTORC1 by the Hp toxin VacA is interpreted as a means used by the bacterium to prevent the production of nutrients needed by immune cells of the host to mount an antibacterial response
Taken alone, inhibition of mTORC1 by VacA may seem at odds with the activation of the same gene by increased concentrations of amino acids.
Actually, Hp has adopted this strategy to better exploit the resources of the host.
Autophagy induced by the VacA toxin is useful to Hp during the gastric mucosa colonization phase
However, once Hp has colonized the gastric mucosa, autophagy becomes harmful for the survival of bacteria.
Therefore, in this phase of infection, VacA is neutralized by CagA
Two virulence factors of Hp, acting antagonistically, protect the survival of bacteria during different phases of the infection: a highly rewarding result for Hp that, by the same mechanism, can inhibit or activate the host cellular metabolism.
Hp directly impacts on mitochondria and inflammation.
Mitochondria are involved in ATP production, apoptosis, lipid, and amino acids metabolism
In our in vitro experiment, the signatures of mitochondrial stress are evident as upregulation of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase SOD2 (Table
At this stage, we can conclude that the traits common to the four diseases can all be associated, at least in part, with Hp.
Several interesting insights emerge from this study.
First, it demonstrates that cell lines can be used successfully to investigate genetic or metabolic disorders.
Cell line experiments, compared to studies on patients, offer the advantage of reducing variables, differences in the diet, use of drugs, or genetic heterogeneity, between participants.
Second, the study raises the question whether a concerted effort to study the basic biology of diseases with several traits in common (as T2D, OB, AD, and CMT) may be more effective than the traditional approach of studying each disease separately.
Third, here, we point out that Hp and mammals have lost the genes coding for essential amino acids.
Evolution gives some hints about the benefits associated with gene loss
Organisms, bacteria as well as mammals, evolve under changing environmental conditions.
If amino acids are available in the environment, the corresponding genes, no longer adaptive, are lost or undergo mutations leading to more adaptive genes.
Following this logic, it seems clear that mammals and Hp are auxotrophic for essential amino acids.
Mammals can obtain essential amino acids from their diet.
Hp finds them in its niche (the gastric mucosa), which is rich in essential amino acids derived from the diet of the host
Finally, we acknowledge a limit of this study.
We describe four traits common to the four diseases and Hp infection.
However, this finding is not sufficient to attribute to Hp a causal role for the above diseases.
Hp could just be the biomarker of a genetic or metabolic disorder carried by the MKN-28 cell line.
It is hard to distinguish between causation and association, especially in the case of highly complex diseases.
Despite the fact that high levels of BCAA anticipate of many years T2D, it is not known yet whether BCAA are the cause of T2D or a biomarker of insulin resistance
However, human stem cells-derived organoids
