Downregulation of synapse-associated protein expression and loss of homeostatic microglial control in cerebrospinal fluid of infectious patients with delirium and patients with Alzheimer’s disease
Delirium is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with long-term cognitive decline.
Due to the strong links between systemic inflammation, delirium and dementia we hypothesized that responses within the brain in patients who develop delirium could show biochemical overlap with patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In this observational study we analyzed protein expression signatures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 15 patients with infectious delirium and compared these to 29 patients with AD, 30 infectious patients without delirium and 15 non-infectious controls free of neurological disease.
A proximity extension assay was performed measuring a total of 184 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins.
Eight inflammatory proteins (4%), including the key neuron-microglia communication marker CX3CL1 (fractalkine), were significantly upregulated in both delirium and AD, compared to infectious patients without delirium.
Likewise, 23 proteins (13%) showed downregulation in both delirium and AD, relative to infectious patients without delirium, which interestingly included CD200R1, another neuron-microglia communication marker, as well as a cluster of proteins related to synapse formation and function.
Synaptopathy is an early event in AD and correlates strongly with cognitive dysfunction.
These results were partially mediated by aging, which is an important predisposing risk factor among many others for both conditions.
Within this study we report the first in vivo human evidence suggesting that synapse pathology and loss of homeostatic microglial control is involved in the pathophysiology of both infectious delirium and AD and thus may provide a link for the association between infections, delirium and long-term cognitive decline.

Introduction
Delirium is an acute mental disorder including fluctuating disturbances in attention, awareness and cognition (American Psychiatric
Especially patients with predisposing factors such as advanced age, comorbidities or a history of cognitive dysfunction are at risk
The overall prevalence in hospitalized medical patients exceeds 10%, which rises to over 20% in elderly (> 65 years) and over 50% in intensive care units and postoperative hip fracture patients
One of the main risk factors for developing delirium is systemic inflammation, e.g.
due to a pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
Although delirium in patients with such an infection ("infectious delirium") was long regarded as a benign, transient condition, it is now recognized to be associated with impaired short-term outcomes and also with impaired long-term psychiatric and cognitive outcomes
It is believed that this risk is mediated through activation of immune cells within the brain (neuroinflammation), caused by pro-inflammatory products from the circulation reaching the brain.
Indeed, neuroinflammation has been shown to play a role in both systemic inflammation as well as in neurodegeneration
However, large knowledge gaps remain on which biochemical pathways are dysregulated in the human brain during systemic inflammation leading to delirium.
Previous studies showed that levels of inflammatory cytokines in preoperatively obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was linked to development of delirium
In another cohort of patients with heterogenous causes for delirium, CSF proteomics showed dysregulated protein expression related to a variety of different biological processes including proteins related to inflammatory, apolipoprotein, hormone and neurotransmission processes
Combined these data suggest a role not only for the inflammatory response as component of delirium but also dysregulation of protein expression in novel and unexpected clusters of proteins.
Since most work has been done with preoperative samples assessing expression changes predisposing to the development of delirium, this warrants further investigation during delirium itself.
Thus far, no studies were conducted during a homogenous cohort of infectious delirium.
Due to the strong associations between systemic inflammation and development of both delirium and dementia we hypothesized that responses within the brain in those patients who develop delirium during a state of systemic inflammation could show spectrum overlap with patients with AD.
Therefore we performed an observational study on CSF of patients with infectious delirium and analyzed protein expression signatures using the novel proximity extension assay technology.
We compared results with patients that did not develop delirium during a systemic infection in addition to patients with AD (positive controls) and non-infectious controls free of neurological disease.

Materials and methods

Selection of CSF samples
The Radboudumc Neurochemistry Laboratory is the Dutch national reference center for diagnostics on cerebrospinal fluid.
This laboratory kindly provided a list of all stored remnant CSF samples of patients that did not object to storage and further use for scientific purposes and where the CSF was sampled in the years 2011-2016.
All CSF samples were collected in the same center in polypropylene tubes and processed by the same lab with corresponding centrifugation and aliquot protocols.
The Regional Medical Ethics Committee ("CMO regio Arnhem-Nijmegen") approved the study protocol and waived the need for additional informed consent.
This study was conducted in accordance to the Helsinki Declaration.
CSF samples were eligible from patients ≥18 years.
Clinical parameters were collected from the patients' medical files.
In infected patients, the indication for the lumbar puncture was to rule out a neurological focus of the infection.
If ancillary investigations ruled out the diagnosis of viral or bacterial meningitis or encephalitis, patients were deemed suitable for inclusion.
Samples were excluded from the study if the patients met any of the following criteria: patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection within the past 6 months, patients with other neurological conditions such as brain injury within the last 3 months, known brain tumors, neurodegenerative disease or pre-existing cognitive impairment, brain or spinal surgery within the last 3 months, presence of a CSF catheter or shunt, severe immunosuppression (neutropenia or HIV) and chronic use of neuroleptics.
Delirium was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV or -5 criteria
Non-infectious controls were selected from the same database.
These patients were free from neurological disorders and underwent a lumbar puncture mainly to exclude disorders (e.g. to rule out high pressure or subarachnoidal hemorrhage in case of thunderclap headache) and conventional diagnostic analysis did not show any abnormalities.
Patients with diseases associated with acute or chronic systemic inflammation (e.g.
infections, Crohn's disease or psoriasis) in their medical history were also excluded as controls.
To compare the samples from infectious patients with 'positive' controls in line with our hypothesis, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5) with reported progression to AD and patients with mild AD (CDR 1) at the time of the lumbar puncture were selected.
The diagnosis of MCI or mild AD was based on neuropsychological and clinical evaluation, including CSF analysis, prior to inclusion in the study and was made by a multidisciplinary team led by AD specialized geriatricians according to international diagnostic criteria.
The subjects with MCI or mild dementia were considered as one group with CDR > 0.

Proximity extension assay technology
Frozen CSF samples were stored in -80 °C and not thawed before.
Frozen aliquots of patient samples were shipped to Olink Bioscience (Uppsala, Sweden) and analyzed there according to the laboratory's standard operating procedure.
Olink Bioscience was blinded to the diagnostic groups.
Analyses were performed using the Olink Proseek® Multiplex Inflammation I 96×96 and the Olink Proseek® Multiplex Neurology I 96×96 panels, which measure both 92 selected inflammatory and 92 neurological proteins respectively, amounting to a total number of 184 measured proteins, requiring only 1 μl of sample.
These panels use a proximity extension assay (PEA) technology where 92 oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probe pairs are allowed to bind to their respective target in the sample, resulting in a high specificity.
Results are reported in relative units referred to as normalized protein expression (NPX) which is in a log2 scale.
The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as 3 standard deviations above background and values below this limit were reported as < LOD.
These were replaced by the minimum value for that particular protein divided by two.
Reported values below zero were replaced by 0.0001.
Proteins with a call rate < 90% (i.e.
< 90% of the patients had a valid measurement of that protein) were removed from further analysis.
To filter out for poorly expressed proteins, only proteins with an average expression of at least 2 for one of the diagnosis groups was kept.
Samples did not pass quality control if Incubation Control 2 or Detection Control (corresponding to that specific sample) deviated more than 0.3 from the median value of all samples.
A total of five samples did not pass quality control for the Inflammation panel and the results from these patients were therefore removed from the statistical analysis for the proteins in this panel.
To correct for systematic bias due to batch effects and differential total protein content, all NPX values were z-transformed per patient.

AD biomarkers
To assess whether preclinical and prodromal AD pathology was present in the infectious groups (with and without delirium) or in the control group, amyloid-β (Aβ) 1-40 , amyloid-β (Aβ) 1-42 , total tau, and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau) were determined batchwise with a simultaneous luminex assay (Milliplex, Merck Millipore, Billerica, USA).
We calculated Aβ 1-42 /Aβ 1-40 ratio's.

Statistical analysis and bioinformatics
Results are reported as mean ( ± SD) if a normal distribution was found using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Non-parametric data is expressed in median and interquartile range (IQR).
The baseline characteristics were tested between groups using one-way ANOVA or Kruskall Wallis test (if the data was non-parametric) for continuous data and with Chi square test for categorical data.
To identify differentially expressed proteins, p-values and changes in z-scores were calculated for each protein for each comparison between diagnostic groups using an unpaired t-test.
We calculated the change in z-score and visualized the patterns of up-and downregulation of proteins compared to non-infectious controls with a heatmap.
We corrected for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment and the FDR-adjusted p-value for significance was determined 0.05.
In order to account for age as a confounding factor between the infectious groups with and without delirium, we performed sensitivity analyses on a cohort of infectious patients without delirium which was age-matched to the infectious delirium and AD cohort.
To assess which proteins cluster together, and might thus operate in the same pathway, we analyzed proteins based on their expression values using unsupervised hierarchical clustering with the ward agglomeration method and Pearson's correlation.
To focus on relevant proteins we only show proteins that have at least a correlation of 0.85 or higher with another protein and have at least an average expression value of > 1 in one of the diagnosis groups.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify groups of CSF proteins that correlate to such an extent that they could be summarized into one new variable (a component).
These components can be used to assess the coherence between proteins and to assess the relation between clusters of proteins with clinical parameters.
PCA was performed on the z-scores of protein expression levels using Varimax rotation, as we assume that latent constructs of protein data may correlate and not be entirely independent.
In order to classify the biological significance of our findings we downloaded the GeneOntology (GO) annotations for each differentially expressed protein from QuickGO
Correlations with systemic inflammatory parameters temperature, blood leukocyte counts and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed with Pearsons's correlation and FDR adjustment was applied to correct for multiple comparisons.

Results

Selection and baseline characteristics
Fig.
We screened 8624 CSF samples for eligibility.
We included 45 samples from patients that suffered from a systemic infection and where an infectious focus within the CNS compartment was ruled out by means of a lumbar puncture in addition to other ancillary testing.
(Fig.
Fifteen of these 45 patients had delirium at time of the lumbar puncture.
Additionally, 15 samples from non-infected controls and 29 samples from patients with mild AD were included.
Demographic characteristics are listed in Table
Patients with infectious delirium or AD were significantly older than infectious patients without delirium and the non-infected controls.
Diabetes and renal disease were more prevalent among delirium patients and hypertension was more prevalent among AD patients.
Infectious patients were more likely to use immunosuppressive medication than the non-infectious controls and AD patients.
It was only possible to calculate the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) in 14 infectious patients of which only 5 patients in the group without delirium.
We observed no relevant differences in sepsis related organ failure and disease severity between infectious delirium and infectious patients without delirium.
Also, no relevant difference in CSF/plasma albumin ratio between the groups was observed in n = 47 samples, suggesting that blood-CSF barrier integrity did not confound the CSF results.
Freezer storage time between sampling and analysis was higher in AD compared to infectious patients with and without delirium, but all samples did not undergo previous thawing.
Importantly, we found no overlap between AD and the other three patient groups in the established CSF biomarkers for AD pathology.
Aβ 1-42 /Aβ 1-40 ratio was significantly lower in AD patients, and total tau and p-tau were significantly higher in AD patients compared to patients with infectious delirium, to infectious patients without delirium, and to non-infectious controls (Fig.
Amyloid ratios and tau levels did not differ between the two infectious groups.

Proximity extension assay results
Thirty-one proteins were excluded because they were detected in less than 90% of the samples.
Importantly, none of these 31 removed proteins showed significantly higher expression frequencies in one of the patient groups and 20 were not expressed in any of the samples (Supplementary Table
A total of 153 proteins was included in the analyses.
Fig.
Details on the differences relative to non-infectious controls are described in the supplemental file.

Similarities in expression patterns between infectious delirium and mild AD
In the upper part of Fig.
Eight proteins were upregulated (shown in blue) in both infectious delirium and AD and these upregulated proteins are mainly involved in chemotaxis and cytokine activity.
Also, the cytokine fractalkine (CX3CL1), which is involved in neuron-microglia communication, was upregulated in both patient groups.
Twenty-three proteins were downregulated (shown in red) in infectious delirium and AD in contrast to the expression in patients with infections without delirium.
These include in order of change in z-score: neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity (NBL1), Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein (THY1), neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM), neurocan core protein (NCAN), brevican core protein (BCAN), tumor necrosis factor receptor super family member 21 (TNFRSF21) and Delta-and Notch like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER).
Many of these downregulated proteins are brain-related and involved in axonal, dendritic, neuronal and synaptic pathways.
Furthermore, several downregulated proteins, including CD200R1, are associated with immunological pathways.
Fig.

Similarities in expression patterns between infectious delirium and infections without delirium
Thirty-four proteins showed a similar expression pattern between infectious delirium and infectious patients without delirium, which contrasted to patients with AD.
These proteins are illustrated in the bottom part of Fig.
All eight upregulated proteins (depicted in blue) in both infectious conditions relative to AD are related to inflammation and these include the pro-inflammatory proteins interleukin-6 (IL6) and interleukin-8 (IL8) and the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL10).
Other inflammatory proteins like C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), C-C motif chemokine 19 (CCL19), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) were downregulated (depicted in red) in both infectious conditions compared to AD. Seventeen proteins originating from the neurological protein panel were also downregulated in the infectious conditions compared to AD (Fig.
In these groups we found downregulation of proteins involved in axonal pathways and brain and nervous system development, relative to AD patients.

Discriminating protein expression for infectious delirium
Proteins labeled with an asterix in Fig.
Delirium was accompanied by downregulation of proteins involved in axonal pathways and upregulation of inflammatory proteins.
The relative expression levels of these proteins are also depicted in Fig.

Cluster and multivariate analysis
In order to determine which proteins cluster together, and might thus operate in the same pathway, we analyzed the proteins based on their expression values using hierarchical clustering.
The results are shown in the hierarchical clustered tree with the corresponding change in z-score relative to healthy controls in the heatmap in Fig.
From these results, three main clusters can be distinguished.
The first clusters consist of the G protein-coupled receptor ligands C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) and 11 (CXCL11), which are both ligands for the CXCR3 receptor.
The regulation of these proteins was however not significantly different in any of the patient comparisons.
Another cluster of proteins that were downregulated in AD and infectious delirium, but not in infections without delirium were mostly brain specific proteins and include repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMA), NBL1, NCAN, THY1, NrCAM, BCAN, cell adhesion molecule (CADM3) and TNFRSF21.
The activator of the NOTCH1 pathway, DNER, and CST5 also cluster together with this group.
shows downregulation in infectious delirium.

larger (n = 30) and younger (mean age: 49.3 ( ± 18) years) than the infectious delirium group (n = 15, mean age: 64.2 ( ± 17) years), we performed age-matching through exclusion of fourteen patients in the infection group without delirium.
This resulted in a cohort of 16 patients with a mean age of 64.2 ( ± 8) years.
Many differences in protein expression compared to AD were still present after age-matching.
Nine proteins were upregulated and the upregulation of IL6, G-CSF and IL8 were most pronounced.
Twenty proteins were downregulated of which CCL19, CD38, CXCL5 and CXCL6 showed the strongest downregulation.
Fig.
This shows a strong linear relation suggesting that the trend of fold changes between patient groups is not severely affected by differences in age.
However p-values shifted due to attenuated statistical power and this resulted in loss of statistical significance for many especially neurology-related proteins (Fig.
Although trends remained the same, statistical significance was lost for 29 proteins that overlapped in delirium and AD, and differed in their expression from the infectious patients without delirium (Fig.

Discussion
In this study we evaluated protein expression patterns in CSF of patients with or without a delirium during a systemic infectious episode and compared those to samples from patients with AD and uninfected controls free of neurologic disease in search for overlap in common pathways linked to inflammation or neurodegeneration.
Our key finding is that we found corresponding protein expression patterns within the CSF of patients with infectious delirium and patients with AD, which contrasted to infected patients that did not suffer from delirium and the controls.
This finding supports the hypothesis of an overlapping pathophysiology for infectious delirium and AD and may explain the strong epidemiological association between the occurrence of delirium and unfavorable long-term cognitive sequalae.
A cluster of proteins mostly related to synapse biology was downregulated in both infectious delirium and AD, in contrast to healthy controls and infectious patients without delirium.
Based on our results, the most promising markers for future studies into synapse pathology were NBL1 (which antagonizes the BMP signaling pathway that regulates synaptic development and strength
Synapse loss is an early event in AD, preceding neuronal death
From all pathological hallmarks, in postmortem brain tissue synaptic loss correlated best with cognitive dysfunction in AD, indicating it as important in the pathogenesis
Both amyloid-β and tau, the well-known AD pathological proteins, contribute substantially to this synapse loss
The data on synaptic loss in neurodegeneration have resulted in ongoing efforts to discover CSF markers of synapse degeneration that could assess AD disease progression in subjects at-risk, even before neurodegeneration or clinical signs of cognitive decline occur
We now show that not only AD patients show downregulation of synapse- associated proteins, but patients with infectious delirium share this feature as well.
The CSF amyloid ratios and tau levels in patients with infectious delirium did not follow the AD pattern, making it less likely that the synapse-related overlap in AD and delirium was due to subclinical AD in patients with delirium.
Many of the proteins we report in this synapse-related cluster have been found to play a role in AD
However, a recent study showed no differences in CSF concentrations of extracellular matrix proteins (BCAN and NCAN) between patients with AD and an age-matched control group
In delirium some of these proteins have only recently been discovered by a proteomic approach
In this latter study especially differences in protein expression between patients with delirium and AD were assessed.
In accordance with our results, NCAN, CADM and Thy1 showed similar regulation in both groups.
However, NrCAM was downregulated in delirium relative to AD. BCAN was downregulated in moderate delirium compared to AD and upregulated in mild delirium compared to AD
In our study we did not distinguish between delirium severities or subtypes.
None of the dysregulated proteins in our cohort were discovered in preoperative samples from patients who developed postoperative delirium subsequently in another proteomics study
It is possible that postoperative delirium develops via different pathophysiological pathways than infection-induced delirium, since in addition to systemic inflammation, surgery is often accompanied by risk factors such as administration of anesthetics, preoperative fasting and dehydration, coagulation abnormalities, hypothermia and postoperative pain
Despite the recent interest in synapse pathology
Using different mice models eliciting delirium-like cognitive dysfunction, it has been shown that inflammatory or traumatic stimuli can cause synaptic loss in the hippocampus and cortex, which is accompanied by cognitive defects
In addition it has been demonstrated that prior degenerative axonal and synaptic pathology increases the risk for cognitive deterioration after a systemic inflammatory challenge even before baseline cognitive impairment has emerged
Accordingly, older animals already had 50% lower synapse numbers at baseline
This preexistent neurodegeneration decreases the threshold and might explain why behavioral deficits are more severely expressed in elderly patients.
These data support a bidirectional interplay in which preexisting synapse pathology can predispose towards the development of delirium and new synapse loss can also occur as a consequence of delirium.
In addition, synaptic loss in neuronal cultures was prevented by inhibiting pro-inflammatory microglial IL-1β signaling through a IL-1 receptor antagonist
Also, it has recently been shown that prior synaptic loss in mice left them selectively vulnerable not only to systemic IL-1β-induced acute cognitive dysfunction, resembling delirium, but also to microglial IL-1β-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and neuronal death
In vivo, microglial activation is regulated by binding of fractalkine to its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia
Interestingly, we found upregulation of fractalkine CSF concentrations in patients with AD and infectious delirium relative to patients with systemic infections.
Fractalkine is a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed on neurons which can be cleaved to generate a soluble fragment
Both fractalkine isoforms can directly regulate microglial activity.
Fractalkine signaling was found to suppress the neuroinflammatory response by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production
Although, fractalkine could be regarded as an attractive target for therapeutic immunomodulation its precise role in neurodegeneration is still unclear.
On the one hand fractalkine signaling may be beneficial in amyloid pathology and stroke, while on the other hand it could also be detrimental in several conditions including tauopathies, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Higher fractalkine mRNA expression was found in tissue homogenates from human AD brain and reflected an intermediate disease stage
Similarly, plasma fractalkine levels were significantly higher in patients with mild to moderate AD than in patients with severe AD
Previous CSF studies show contrasting results on fractalkine in AD
Our data add the novel finding of an overlap in fractalkine expression pattern in patients with infectious delirium and AD.
Loss of microglial homeostatic control is further illustrated by a shared downregulated expression of CD200R1 in patients with AD and infectious delirium, relative to infectious patients without delirium.
CD200R1 is, similar to CX3CR1, a membrane-bound molecule expressed by microglia
Through binding to its ligand CD200, which is expressed by neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, this receptor inhibits pro-inflammatory microglial activation.
Defects in CD200-CD200R1 signaling during inflammation produce an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response upon repeated stimuli.
This microglial priming has been related to development of neurodegenerative diseases
Histological studies in AD patients have previously shown reduced expression of both CD200 and CD200R1
In delirium, this microglial regulatory pathway has not been studied previously.
Of interest is also the downregulation of caspase-8 (CASP8) in CSF from patients with infectious delirium and AD.
This protease is not only involved in apoptotic cell death but also controls microglial activation and thus the degree of neuroinflammation
Post-mortem brain samples from AD patients have shown significant cytoplasmic expression of activated CASP8 mainly in microglia
To our knowledge, the association between CASP8 and delirium is a new finding.
Although we found important similarities in CSF protein expression between infectious delirium and AD, the PCA shows the most resemblance in protein expression between both infectious patients groups.
This is most likely due to the fact that many proteins within the used PEA panels are immune system related, leading to an overlapping expression profile in both infectious groups.
Irrespective of the overlap between the infectious groups, the similarities in protein expression between infectious delirium and AD provides us with insights in shared pathophysiological pathways between these two latter groups.
Nine proteins were significantly dysregulated in infectious delirium relative to the other three patient groups.
These included upregulation of several inflammatory proteins and downregulation of two proteins involved in neurogenesis: protogenin (PRTG) and disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 22 (ADAM 22).
These latter have not previously been associated with delirium.
Studies analyzing CSF biomarkers for delirium in patients have resulted in a wide variety of candidates and sometimes with inconsistent results.
Amyloid-β isoforms, phosphorylated and total tau, neurotransmitters and hormones, inflammatory proteins, markers for blood-CSF barrier disruption and neuronal cell death have been studied
Nevertheless, the  current literature supports the vulnerable brain concept in which biomarker evidence for both neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is associated with delirium, which is in line with findings from this current study.
Several limitations of this study should be taken into account.
Most importantly, this was a retrospective observational study.
Obtaining CSF is only possible through invasive procedures which makes prospective sampling from patients with delirium for research purposes challenging.
Several previous studies have overcome this problem by sampling through spinal anesthetic catheters prior to surgical procedures.
A major drawback from such an approach is that the sampling is before and not during occurrence of delirium and that in these patients many different predisposing and co-occurring risk factors play a role (e.g.
use of anesthetics, postoperative pain, use of opioids and benzodiazepines, etc.) which introduce heterogeneity and impedes the search for a specific pathogenetic pathway.
Our aim was to study pathophysiological pathways in patients that developed a delirium due to a systemic infection because of the strong link between systemic inflammation (and infections) and dementia and the link between dementia and delirium.
We therefore chose a retrospective study design using biobanked samples.
Consequently, this introduces risks of misclassification, confounding, and pre-analytical differences.
In order to reduce the risk on misclassification we carefully selected the cases applying strict in-and exclusion criteria.
Regarding possible confounding factors, we were unfortunately not able to include enough controls or infectious patients with delirium to completely match patients based on their baseline demographics, despite using a large CSF biobank.
Age is one of such factors that differed between the included groups.
Age-matching infectious patients without delirium to the infectious cohort with delirium led to loss of statistical significance of differences in neurology-related protein expression between these two groups.
This was most likely a power issue due to small sample sizes as we have shown by a strong linear relation between fold changes before and after age-matching that the trend of fold changes remained mostly intact following age-matching.
As such, our data suggest that aging was only partially responsible for the differences in protein expression within the two systemic infection cohorts.
Aging is a strong known risk factor for delirium and combined with our data, synaptic loss could mediate this.
A recent study using transcriptomics on human brain tissue showed that advancing age was associated with downregulation of synapses among other processes
Our data of a possible interaction between synapse dysfunction, and loss of homeostatic microglial control precipitating especially elderly patients to development of delirium warrants further studies.
Pre-analytical differences were limited to a longer freezer storage time for samples from AD patients, however since samples did not undergo previous thawing, we expect the effects on our results limited.
Another disadvantage of the retrospective study design is that cognitive testing is not routinely performed in patients and therefore information on cognition in the groups is missing.
However, none of the patients with infections or non-infectious controls had known neurodegenerative disease (including MCI) at enrollment.
This was corroborated by the analysis of the CSF patterns of amyloid and tau.
Finally, with the PEA technology we used one cannot customize the panels and these contain only 92 preselected proteins.
This may introduce an important bias and substantially limits the options for systems biology approaches for pathway analyses.
Nevertheless, this technology is much more cost affordable compared to proteomics and enabled us to measure over 150 proteins in CSF (using 2 panels) with high precision and use of very low volume specimens.
Since this is a hypothesis-generating study, our results should be validated using independent assays and a second validation cohort in future work.
Strengths of our study include that we used CSF specimens taken during the delirium episode.
Compared to most studies where causes of delirium vary substantially amongst included patients, we were able to create a relatively homogeneous cohort with only infectious patients as cases.
We included not only infectious patients with and without delirium but also non-infectious controls and patients with AD.
Previous studies often did not include a control group with systemic inflammation but no delirium.
This increased our ability to investigate other possible confounding factors that could have accounted for differences between infectious patients with an acute illness and outpatient AD patients and test our hypothesis in search of overlapping pathways underlying infectious delirium and dementia.
In conclusion, this is the first study in humans in vivo indicating that synapse pathology and loss of homeostatic microglial control are involved in the pathophysiology of both infectious delirium and AD.
Our data suggests that the synaptopathy and loss of homeostatic microglial control in patients with delirium were not due to underlying preclinical AD-like pathology that predisposes to the development of delirium.
Whether these phenomena are indeed key underlying mechanisms specific to delirium warrants validation in future studies.
Our observations may provide an explanation for the well-known associations between infection, delirium and the development of long-term cognitive decline.

The extracellular matrix proteins neurocan core protein (NCAN) and brevican core protein (BCAN) form an organized structure called the perineuronal net, which is vital for synaptogenesis, synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity.
Neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM), cell adhesion molecule 3 (CADM3), repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMA) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21 (TNFRSF21) play a role in synapse formation.
THY1 (CD90) stabilizes neuronal synapses.
Neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity (NBL1) is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and BMP signaling regulates synaptic development and strength.
Delta and Notchlike epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) affects glutamate uptake function which in turn affects synaptic transmission.
The cells in blue and orange represent neurons.

Fig. 8. Effect of age-matching on fold changes and p-values of protein expression within patient groups.
Fold changes (A-C) and -10log(p-values) (D-F) of comparisons of protein expression with infectious patients without delirium before (on x-axis) and after age-matching (on y-axis).
Red circles in A-C indicate proteins which lost significance after age-matching of the infectious patients (FDR-corrected p-value > 0.05, according to paired t-tests).
These proteins are depicted in the right lower quadrant in D-F.
Proteins in the right upper quadrant remained significantly different after age-matching.
Proteins depicted in the left upper quadrant became significantly different following age-matching.
The composition of the original and age-matched cohort is shown in G. Statistical significant overlap in protein expression was lost after age-matching for proteins depicted in H. Control: non-infected controls; Infection, no delirium: Infectious patients without delirium; AD: Alzheimer's disease; Delirium: infectious delirium.
