Elevated CLOCK and BMAL1 Contribute to the Impairment of Aerobic Glycolysis from Astrocytes in Alzheimer’s Disease
Altered glucose metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Aerobic glycolysis from astrocytes is a critical metabolic pathway for brain energy metabolism.
Disturbances of circadian rhythm have been associated with AD.
While the role of circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain muscle ARNT-like1 (BMAL1), the major components in the regulation of circadian rhythm, has been identified in the brain, the mechanism by which CLOCK and BMAL1 regulates the dysfunction of astrocytes in AD remains unclear.
Here, we show that the protein levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 are significantly elevated in impaired astrocytes of cerebral cortex from patients with AD.
We demonstrate that the over-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 significantly suppresses aerobic glycolysis and lactate production by the reduction in hexokinase 1 (HK1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) protein levels in human astrocytes.
Moreover, the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 induces functional impairment by the suppression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive filaments in human astrocytes.
Furthermore, the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 promotes cytotoxicity by the activation of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in human astrocytes.
These results suggest that the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 contributes to the impairment of astrocytes by inhibition of aerobic glycolysis in AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of memory and cognitive function
Recent studies suggest that AD is a metabolic neurodegenerative disease
The impairment in cerebral glucose metabolism is an invariant pathophysiological feature in AD
The reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism is linked to AD progression and cognitive dysfunction
Recent studies showed that the alteration of aerobic glycolysis is linked to the pathogenesis of AD
Astrocytes are the most numerous subtypes of glial cell population in the central nervous system (CNS)
The roles of astrocytes have been linked to brain development and function such as synapse formation and function, control of neurotransmitters release and uptake, production of trophic factors and control of neuronal survival
In brain energy metabolism, the interaction of astrocytes with neuron and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a critical role in metabolic support to neurons through neurometabolic coupling including aerobic glycolysis, glutamate and Na-K-ATPase activation, and lactate release
As a hub for neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling, astrocytes provide the function as gatekeepers of neuronal energy supply
Glucose metabolism is an important metabolic pathway for growth and survival in many types of cells
Previously, we have shown that the impairment of glycolysis induces apoptotic cell death
Aerobic glycolysis from astrocytes is a critical metabolic pathway that processes the utilization of glucose to generate lactate as a metabolic intermediate which is used as a primary energy source for neurons
In the aerobic glycolysis pathway, hexokinase 1 (HK1) is a first key enzyme for the initiation of glycolysis
As the final step of anaerobic glycolysis, lactate is produced by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
LDH is composed of four subunits.
The two different subunits are LDHA (the M (muscle type) subunit of LDH) and LDHB (the H (heart type) subunit of LDH), which both retain the same active site and amino acids participating in the enzyme reaction
Astrocytes express the protein of LDHA in the human brain
Previous studies suggest that lactate production and transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation
In addition, lactate has also been identified as a novel metabolite that induces expression of genes associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain
Disturbances of circadian rhythm have been associated with AD
Recent evidence demonstrates that sleep-wake and circadian rhythm disturbances often occur early in the progress of AD
Additionally, the disruption of circadian rhythm is linked to metabolic imbalance
Circadian rhythm is mediated by the transcriptional-translational feedback loop of core clock genes (TTLs) including circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), brain muscle ARNT-like1 (BMAL1), period1 (PER1), PER2, cryptochrome1 (CRY1), and CRY2
CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins play in a positive feedback loop to regulate the expression of TTLs which are involved in diverse physiological process including major components of energy homeostasis like feeding behavior, locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycle and glucose utilization
However, the mechanisms by which CLOCK/BMAL1 regulates aerobic glycolysis from astrocytes in AD remain unclear.
Here, we show that the protein levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 are significantly elevated in impaired astrocytes of cerebral cortex from patients with AD.
We demonstrate that the overexpression of CLOCK and BMAL1 significantly suppresses aerobic glycolysis and lactate production by a reduction in HK1 and LDHA protein levels in human astrocytes.
Moreover, the over-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 induces the functional impairment by suppression of GFAP-positive filaments levels in human astrocytes.
Furthermore, the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 promotes cytotoxicity by the activation of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in human astrocytes.
These results suggest that the elevated CLOCK and BMAL1 contribute to the impairment of aerobic glycolysis from astrocytes in AD.

Results

The Levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 Are Elevated in Impaired Astrocytes on Cortex Region from Patients with Alzheimer's Disease
To investigate the role of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the dysfunction of astrocytes in patients with AD, we analyzed whether the protein levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 were elevated in the astrocytes surrounding the BBB of brains from patients with AD (Table
We measured the protein levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 in GFAP-positive astrocytes surrounding the BBB on brain temporal cortex tissues from patients with AD or non-AD donor (normal) using immunofluorescence staining (Figure
Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the intensity of CLOCK-positive staining in GFAP-positive astrocytes surrounding the BBB were increased in the molecular layer (ML) on the cortex region of patients with AD (AD) relative to non-AD donor (normal) (Figure
Moreover, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes surrounding the BBB was significantly less in ML on the cortex region of patients with AD (AD) relative to non-AD donor (Normal) (Figure
Furthermore, the length of GFAP-positive filaments was shorter, and the shape of GFAP-positive filaments was more shrunk with AD (AD) compared to non-AD donor (Normal) (Figure
Notably, the number of impaired astrocytes that have the positive subcellular co-localization between CLOCK and GFAP were significantly increased in patients with AD (AD) (Figure
Consistent with CLOCK protein levels, the intensity of BMAL1-positive staining in GFAP-positive astrocytes surrounded BBB were increased in ML on cortex region of patients with AD (AD) relative to the non-AD donor (normal) (Figure
The number of impaired astrocytes that have the positive subcellular co-localization between BMAL1 and GFAP were significantly increased in patients with AD (AD) (Figure
The levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 were generally higher in every individual patient with AD.
These results suggest that the CLOCK and BMAL1 protein levels in impaired astrocytes surrounding the BBB were elevated in patients with AD.

We examined whether the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 could suppress aerobic glycolysis in human astrocytes.
We analyzed the changes of aerobic glycolysis activity by over-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 in human astrocytes.
We measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as the parameter of aerobic glycolysis activity by the quantification of lactate production.
The glycolytic activity was measured by the sequential addition of glucose, which is the substrate of glycolysis, oligomycin, a selective inhibitor for mitochondrial respiration, and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a specific inhibitor of glycolysis.
We first examined the change of ECAR levels by CLOCK over-expression in human astrocytes (Figure
The levels of ECAR in response to glucose were significantly suppressed by CLOCK over-expression relative to control (Figure
We next investigated the molecular target in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis pathway by CLOCK over-expression in human astrocytes.
We analyzed the levels of hexokinase 1 (HK1), which is a first key enzyme for the initiation of glycolysis, and LDHA, which is a critical enzyme to produce lactate, in human astrocytes (Figure

The Elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 Contributes to the Functional Impairment by Reduction in GFAP-Positive Filaments in Human Astrocytes
Next, we investigated the role of CLOCK and BMAL1 in the functional impairment of astrocytes in AD.
We examined whether the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 could induce the functional impairment by reduction in GFAP-positive filaments, which plays a role in astrocyte-neuron interactions as well as cell-cell communication, in human astrocytes.
We first analyzed the changes of GFAP-positive filaments and cellular morphology by CLOCK and BMAL1 over-expression using immunofluorescence staining (Figure
Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that the intensity of GFAP-positive filaments was significantly reduced by CLOCK over-expression compared to control (Figure
Moreover, the length of GFAP-positive filaments in cytosol was shorter, and the shape of GFAP-positive filaments was shrunk by CLOCK over-expression relative to control (Figure

The Elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 Induces Cytotoxicity in Human Astrocytes
We next investigated the role of CLOCK and BMAL1 in cytotoxicity of astrocytes in AD.
Since the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 resulted in the impairment of aerobic glycolysis and GFAP-positive filaments in human astrocytes, we examined whether the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 could induce the cell death.
We analyzed the morphological changes of cytotoxicity by over-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 using 3D analyzer in human astrocytes.
Notably, CLOCK over-expression increased the morphological features of cytotoxicity including shrinkage and blebbing relative to the control (Figure
Moreover, the compartment of cytosolic organelles such as mitochondria was disrupted by over-expression of CLOCK relative to the control (Figure
Furthermore, the number of morphological dead cells by CLOCK over-expression was significantly increased compared to the control (Figure
Consistent with the morphological analysis, the over-expression of CLOCK significantly increased the levels of cytotoxicity relative to the control (Figure
Similarly, BMAL1 over-expression increased the morphological features of cytotoxicity compared to the control (Figure
The number of morphological dead cells and the levels of cytotoxicity were significantly increased by BMAL1 over-expression relative to the control (Figure
These results suggest that the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 induces the cytotoxicity in human astrocytes.

The Elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 Induces Caspase-3-Dependent Apoptosis in Human Astrocytes
Next, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 promotes cell death of astrocytes in AD.
We examined whether the over-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 could induce caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in human astrocytes.
We measured the levels of cleaved caspase-3 as an active form of capase-3 in the apoptosis pathway.

Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 contributes to the impairment of astrocytes in AD.
We suggest that the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 induces the impairment of aerobic glycolysis and GFAP-positive filaments in human astrocytes.
Our findings provide a molecular mechanism by which the elevation of CLOCK and BMAL1 is critical for the metabolic and functional dysfunction of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of AD.
Disturbances of circadian rhythm have been associated with AD
Recent study suggests that disturbances of circadian rhythm often occur at an early stage in the progress of AD as an important clinical feature
However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which disturbances of circadian rhythm affect the metabolic and functional impairment of astrocytes in AD is still not fully understood.
Our results suggest that the elevation of CLOCK/BMAL1 in astrocytes represents the disruption of interactions of astrocytes with neurons and BBB by disturbances of circadian rhythm during AD.
Similarly, BMAL1 gene expression in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of hypothalamus, which is the principal circadian pacemaker, was significantly increased in 18-month-old AD mice compared to 18-month-old non-AD mice in response to 12 h exposure to darkness in light and dark cycle test
Consistent with previous study, our results indicate that the abnormal expression of BMAL1 was observed in brain of patients with AD.
Since the previous study showed the alteration of circadian rhythm gene expression in AD mice
As the most important energy regulator, astrocytes are well known in the brain
Aerobic glycolysis from astrocytes is a critical metabolic pathway for lactate production and supply of lactate to neurons using glucose in blood vessels
Although the role of aerobic glycolysis and lactate production in astrocytes has been demonstrated, the molecular targets that trigger the impairment of aerobic glycolysis and lactate production in astrocytes during AD are not well understood.
Our results suggest that CLOCK/BMAL1 could be a critical molecule in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis and lactate production in astrocytes during AD.
Similarly, the analysis by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) (FDG-PET) imaging revealed that the glucose utilization was reduced in the brains of patients with AD
These previous studies suggest that FDG-PET imaging might be an important diagnostic tool that increases diagnostic accuracy and confidence for AD
Consistent with previous study, our findings indicate that the dysfunction of aerobic glycolysis from astrocytes might be linked to the lower glucose uptake in FDG-PET imaging of patients with AD.
In addition to FDG-PET imaging, the sleep test, which measures both sleep quality and sleep quantity, would need to be a diagnostic tool of AD.
We anticipate the sleep test to be more appealing for use as a diagnostic tool in human AD in the future.
As well as the metabolic function, astrocytes have important roles, such as physical support, biochemical support and repair and scarring of injury for the BBB and neurons
In these functions of astrocytes, GFAP is proposed to play a role in astrocyte-neuron interactions and cell-cell communication
In addition, GFAP has been shown to be important in repair after injury in brain
Our results show that the reduction in GFAP-positive filaments is linked to the morphological dysfunction of astrocytes, which have the high levels of CLOCK/BMAL1, in AD patients and human astrocytes.
Our findings indicate that the elevation of CLOCK/BMAL1 could be a potential mechanism of the disruption of GFAP-mediated interaction of astrocytes with BBB and neurons in AD.
Although we showed the reduction in GFAP levels by CLOCK/BMAL1 over-expression in human astrocytes, there is a limitation to support whether the elevation of CLOCK/BMAL1 can directly affect the impairment of GFAP-mediated interaction of astrocytes in patients with AD.
Further study for the role of CLOCK/BMAL1 elevation on the GFAP-mediated interaction of astrocytes in patients with AD would need to be studied.
In the function of astrocytes, the role of reactive astrocytes in the contribution to plaque formation and maturation or to amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance and plaque growth restriction is still unclear
Our results indicate that the impaired astrocytes, which have the short and shrunk GFAP-positive filaments, have the high levels of CLOCK/BMAL1 expression in the brains of patients with AD.
Although we found the morphological impairment of astrocyte in patients with AD, it is unclear whether these impaired astrocytes play a role as reactive astrocytes or dysfunctional astrocytes in AD.
Further study for the regulation and role of CLOCK/BMAL1 expression in reactive astrocytes in vitro would need to be studied.
The astrocytic apoptosis is associated with both senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD
Consistent with this previous study, our results suggest that the elevation of CLOCK/BMAL1 contributes to the activation of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in astrocytes.
Since the inhibition of glycolysis induces apoptotic cell death
In our study, we demonstrate that the elevation of CLOCK/BMAL1 could be an important molecular mechanism in the dysfunction of astrocytes during the pathogenesis of AD.
