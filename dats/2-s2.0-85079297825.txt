Impaired Innate Immunity Mechanisms in the Brain of Alzheimer’s Disease
Among environmental factors likely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), persistent virus infections, and age-related progressive decline of immune competence might play a pivotal role.
However, AD antimicrobial brain immune responses are poorly investigated.
The present study focused on genes involved in antimicrobial defenses, especially against virus infections, in the AD brain.
In particular, mRNA levels of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α genes were analyzed in hippocampus and temporal cortex brain samples from AD and non-demented controls.
All subjects were also genotyped for APOE ε, IRF7, MED23, and IL28B gene polymorphisms.
Most AD patients showed decreased mRNA levels of all investigated genes in the hippocampus and temporal cortex.
However, a small group of AD patients showed increased hippocampal mRNA expression of MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α.
mRNA levels of MED23, IL28B, IFN-α from the hippocampus and those of MED23 from the temporal cortex were further decreased in APOE ε4 allele AD carriers.
Moreover, rs6598008 polymorphism of IRF7 was significantly associated with decreased hippocampal expression of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α.
These findings suggest that AD brains show impaired innate antimicrobial gene expression profiles, and individual genetic makeup, such as positivity for the APOE ε4 and IRF7 A alleles, might affect brain immune efficiency.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent form of dementia in the elderly
It is of interest that declining immunity during aging is often associated with persistent antigen stimulation and peripheral chronic inflammation
Moreover, neuroinflammation has emerged as a relevant component of AD brain pathology
Pathogens, such as viruses of the herpes family, through frequent cycles of reactivation and latency, constantly trigger the immune system, which is not able to completely eradicate these microbes.
Therefore, persistent neurotropic pathogens might play a role in microglia activation in the brain of genetically susceptible elderly and contribute to neurodegenerative processes
The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, which is associated with neurodegenerative processes of AD, showed antimicrobial activity against eight common and clinically relevant microorganisms
Aβ peptide 2 of 13 shares several chemical and biological characteristics of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are components of the innate immune system
Moreover, Aβ peptide showed a protective activity against in vitro infection by the neurotropic virus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)
This observation reinforces the notion that persistent and latent herpes virus infections may lead to Aβ overproduction that, in turn, contributes to amyloid plaque formation
Recent findings have confirmed a causative role of viruses of the herpes family in AD
We previously suggested that the concomitant presence of a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD might result in a genetic signature predisposing to AD via complex and diverse mechanisms, each contributing to modulate individual susceptibility to herpes virus infection
According to this view, efficient immune response is mandatory to preserve brain structure and functioning during aging, and chronic brain infections might play a pathogenic role in the clinical progression of sporadic AD in the elderly with declining immune efficiency
Data regarding the efficiency of human brain immune responses in AD is scanty, and in the present paper, we investigate the brain expression of a selected set of genes belonging to the innate immunity and involved in antivirus defense, such as interferons.
Different members of the Interferon (IFN) family play a pivotal role in the human anti-viral defenses
IFNs can be produced by several cell types and primarily act as antiviral and immune-modulatory cytokines
IFN-α/β or type I IFN and IFN-λ or type III IFN bind distinct receptors.
However, they regulate the same sets of genes and show similar biological activities
IFN-λ is a recently discovered group of defensive molecules comprising several members such as IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3, also known as IL29, IL28A, and IL28B, respectively
An IFN-λ4 type has also been described
Up-regulation of IFN-λ transcription has been shown to depend on the same stimuli, sensors, and signal transduction pathways, as those involved in type I IFN production
In the mouse brain, IFN-α/β was readily produced after infection with various viral RNAs, whereas IFN-λ expression remained lower
IFNs expression is regulated by a family of transcription factors named interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), and they show relevant roles in brain antiviral defenses
In fact, IRF7 and IRF9 share different functions, including host defense, cell growth, apoptosis, and immune cell differentiation
Mediator complex (MED) 23 is an anti-viral component of the mediator complex and regulates the transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes, which in turn up-regulates IFN-λ by interacting with IRF7
IRF7 was originally identified in the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and has since emerged as the crucial regulator of type I IFNs after activation by pathogen recognition receptors
Type I IFN induction is mainly regulated by IRF3 and IRF7.
IRF3 is expressed constitutively, whereas IRF7 is an IFN-stimulated gene, often induced during late phases of virus infection.
Therefore, the IFNs induced IRF7 response and IRF7 activation by viral infection provide a positive feedback for further IFNs production.
Moreover, both IRF3 and IRF7 regulated the IFN-λ1 gene expression, whereas IRF7 has been shown the major regulator of IFN-λ2/3 genes
Our recent findings showed that SNPs in genes regulating antiviral responses are differentially distributed in AD and influence a differential blood positivity to EBV and HHV-6 in the elderly
Moreover, risk alleles were increased in the elderly progressing to AD
These findings suggested that individual genetic background might play a role in the progression of cognitive impairment by influencing the efficiency of immune responses to persistent viruses.
Knowledge regarding the efficiency of human brain immune responses against bacteria and viruses during aging and AD is limited.
In the present study, the mRNA expression of genes involved in antimicrobial responses, such as IRF7, MED23, IL28B or IFN-λ3, and IFN-α, in hippocampus and temporal cortex specimens from human controls and AD patients was studied.
Moreover, the influence of apolipoprotein (APOE) ε 4, IRF7, MED23, and IL28B gene polymorphisms upon mRNA levels of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α genes was also analyzed.
Our findings showed that impaired mRNA levels of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α were present in AD hippocampus and temporal cortex samples.
APOE ε4 and IRF7 A alleles negatively affected mRNA levels in AD hippocampus.
Antimicrobial defense mechanisms of innate immunity appear to be impaired in the AD brain, and such alterations might contribute to neurodegeneration.

Results
Demographic and clinical features, such as age, gender, clinical diagnosis, disease duration (DD), post-mortem interval (PMI), brain weight, cause of death, and brain area, of patients with AD have been reported in Table
AD neuropathological diagnosis, Braak and Thal amyloid deposition scores have been summarized in Table
The majority of AD brains showed decreased hippocampus mRNA levels of IRF7 (n = 28), MED23 (n = 20), IL28B (n = 21), and IFN-α (n = 19), whilst a small AD group had increased mRNA levels of MED23 (n = 11), IL28B (n = 12), and IFN-α (n = 9).
A similar mRNA expression pattern was detected in AD temporal cortex samples, since a larger AD group showed downregulation of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α genes (Figure
A minority of AD showed normal or slightly increased mRNA levels of the above immune factors (Figure
Brain samples were also genotyped for APOE ε polymorphism and gene variations of IRF7, MED23, and IL28B.
The presence of APOE ε4 allele was associated with decreased mRNA levels of MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α in AD hippocampus samples and of MED23 in AD temporal cortex samples, as shown in Figure
The presence of APOE ε4 allele was associated with decreased mRNA levels of MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α in AD hippocampus samples and of MED23 in AD temporal cortex samples, as shown in Figure

Discussion
The presence of MED23, IL28B, IFN-α gene polymorphisms was not associated with mRNA levels of the four immune factors in both hippocampus and temporal cortex specimens (data not shown).
No relationship between IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α mRNA levels and Braak and Braak or Thal scores, duration of the disease, and brain weight was found (data not shown).

Discussion
The efficiency of immune responses declines with advancing age
However, the role of the immune system in the disease is still unclear.
Genome-wide association studies performed in AD reported that several genes with immune regulatory functions were associated with differential risk of the disease
However, a more defined role of genes regulating innate immunity with the pathogenesis and clinical history of AD remains to be assessed.
Infections by pathogens, such as the Herpes virus, have been suggested to play a role in the clinical progression of the disease
It is known that even in healthy young persons, the immune system never completely eradicates these pathogens.
In the elderly, repeated cycles of activation and latency, along with infective agent persistence, may further impair immune responses and accelerate the senescence of the immune system
Moreover, herpes viruses, which are neurotropic, might directly infect and damage selected brain areas in genetically susceptible elderly, contributing to neurodegenerative mechanisms
Recent findings confirm and extend the association of herpes virus infection with neurodegeneration and AD
Other pathogens have been implicated in the clinical history of AD
Recent data showed that amyloid-Aβ peptide protected against microbial infection in AD animal models
For instance, Aβ oligomerization was necessary for its antimicrobial activity, and brain infection of 5XFAD mice by Salmonella Typhimurium bacterium resulted in an amyloid deposition surrounding the invading bacteria
These data are compatible with the notion that the amyloid-Aβ peptide might be a component of the innate immunity against brain pathogens and virus brain chronic infection may induce its production.
Findings in the present article showed that gene expression of antimicrobial defense factors, such as IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α, was impaired in AD brains.
Most AD brains showed decreased mRNA levels of these defensive factors, while a minority of AD patients had increased levels.
Differential expression patterns might represent different AD clinical stages.
Brains overexpressing the immune factors might actively respond to an active regional infection or tissue insult.
After a partially successful immune response, a latent viral phase is induced, and these factors are downregulated.
Such a decrement would decrease the concomitant activation of microglia and astrocyte, downregulate neuroinflammation, and mitigate neuronal damages.
In other words, we suggest that different expression patterns of immune factors and cytokines may describe different reactivation and latency cycles of infectious agents.
Increased mRNA levels of MED 23, IL28B, and IFN-α were found only in the AD hippocampus, and our data suggest that different brain regions appear to be differentially involved in these chronic inflammatory responses.
Replicating neurons in the hippocampus cortex
Therefore, persistent inflammation may induce accelerated neurodegenerative mechanisms in this brain area.
Possible regulatory mechanisms of the innate immunity genes upon amyloid-Aβ peptide expression in normal or AD brains have been poorly explored.
However, it cannot be excluded that amyloid-Aβ peptide might function as an emergency defensive mechanism and compensate the impaired efficiency of other specialized immune defensive genes in the aging brain.
Here, we showed that MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α mRNA hippocampus levels in AD APOE ε4 carriers were further decreased.
The temporal cortex from AD APOE ε4 carriers also showed the lowest values of MED23 and IFN-α mRNA levels.
It is known that APOE affects immunity since increased systemic pro-inflammatory states and altered immune responses have been found in APOE deficient mice
Therefore, at least part of the increasing AD risk effect of the APOE ε4 allele might be mediated by a negative influence on the brain's immune efficiency.
Our data show that IRF7 allele A carrier status was associated with decreased levels of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α expression in the AD hippocampus.
These findings reinforce the notion that individual genetic makeup affects brain immune efficiency.
Findings regarding IFN and brain functions are scanty.
However, transgenic mice chronically overexpressing astrocyte IFN-α developed a progressive inflammatory encephalopathy and neurodegeneration
Moreover, IRF7 deficient mice produced elevated levels of CXCL13 after virus infection and showed impaired regulation of microglia activity
It is interesting to note that type I-IFNs also play a critical role in regulating tissue homeostasis and regeneration.
Insufficient resilience, defined as impaired repair and regeneration of host tissues, rather than inefficient infectious agent clearance, may induce chronic neuroinflammation
Our results are in accordance with different genetic investigations from genome-wide association studies showing an association of several immune regulatory genes with AD pathogenesis
In fact, subsequent complementary statistics and bio-informatic approaches showed that several single-gene polymorphisms in IFN genes increased AD risk
Results from our investigation further support the relevance of IFN family genes in AD.
Our findings from post-mortem brain samples, however, do not rule out that the impaired expression of these genes might be a late event in the clinical progression of the disease, since, most AD patients showed high Braak and Thal scores.
Protein levels of these immune factors in AD brains were not measured, since many variables, such as post-mortem latency, disease stage or duration, may increase case protein variability, and this is a limitation of our investigation.
Moreover, astrocyte or microglia classical neuropathological markers of activation were not investigated.
Therefore, the contribution of these cell populations to brain mRNA levels of IRF7, MED23, IL28B, and IFN-α remains to be explored.
However, astrogliosis, along with a decrease of neuron number, are classical neuropathology hallmarks of the AD brain
Our data showed that different factors, such as brain area locations and individual genetic makeup, along with other undetermined factors, affect gene expression of innate immunity components and indirectly support the notion that impaired innate immune responses against brain insults, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or their products, might accelerate neurodegenerative mechanisms in the elderly.
A recent book elaborates in detail the role of infective agents in AD
In conclusion, the maintenance of efficient immune responses during aging might slow down neurodegenerative mechanisms associated with senile dementia and affect both the prevalence and incidence of AD.
Further investigations regarding infections, immune defensive mechanisms, and AD progression might open new ways for AD prevention and therapy.
