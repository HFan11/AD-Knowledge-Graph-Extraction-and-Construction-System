Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease: a Key Player in the Transition Between Homeostasis and Pathogenesis
Immune activation accompanies the development of proteinopathy in the brains of Alzheimer's dementia patients.
Evolving from the long-held viewpoint that immune activation triggers the pathological trajectory in Alzheimer's disease, there is accumulating evidence now that microglial activation is neither pro-amyloidogenic nor just a simple reactive process to the proteinopathy.
Preclinical studies highlight an interesting aspect of immunity, i.e., spurring immune system activity may be beneficial under certain circumstances.
Indeed, a dynamic evolving relationship between different activation states of the immune system and its neuronal neighbors is thought to regulate overall brain organ health in both healthy aging and progression of Alzheimer's dementia.
A new premise evolving from genome, transcriptome, and proteome data is that there might be at least two major phases of immune activation that accompany the pathological trajectory in Alzheimer's disease.
Though activation on a chronic scale will certainly lead to neurodegeneration, this emerging knowledge of a potential beneficial aspect of immune activation allows us to form holistic insights into when, where, and how much immune system activity would need to be tuned to impact the Alzheimer's neurodegenerative cascade.
Even with the trove of recently emerging -omics data from patients and preclinical models, how microglial phenotypes are functionally related to the transition of a healthy aging brain towards progressive degenerative state remains unknown.
A deeper understanding of the synergism between microglial functional states and brain organ health could help us discover newer interventions and therapies that enable us to address the current paucity of disease-modifying therapies in Alzheimer's disease.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD), accompanied by inexorable dementia, is a scourge of the aging population.
The etiology of the sporadic forms of AD remains under intense debate.
The main neuropathological hallmarks of AD are proteinaceous aggregates of amyloid β (Aβ) and tau that progress in a stereotypical fashion in the brain leading to neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric decline
AD is now acknowledged not to be a neuron-predominant disease, as evidence now supports that brain-resident non-neuronal cells (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), as well as peripheral immune cells (such as B cells, T cells, and neutrophils), play pivotal roles in the disease process.
In this review, we focus on microglia vis-à-vis their role in the AD pathogenesis process.
Microglia and astrocytes are two of the main cell types involved in intrinsic immune function in the brain.
In the past decade, the identification of several immune genes as genetic risk factors for AD has revolutionized our conceptual knowledge of the relevance of immune homeostasis in AD
Emerging at the same time, transcriptomic data from different labs have helped us characterize differential gene expression patterns in microglia associated with AD neuropathologies in mouse models and in human brain tissue
This information has now changed how we view microglial activation in health and disease.
Functional activation of microglia, reflected in transcriptomic and morphological alterations, used to be commonly referred to as neuroinflammation or the M1 phenotype.
Both these terms, "neuroinflammation" and "M1," have now been superseded by other terms that are reflective of the dynamic functionality of the immune system.
In this era of singlecell information, we have come to appreciate a wide range of microglial activation states, characterized by brain area and context-specific phenotypes that accompany the different stages of healthy aging and diseases of the brain
Immune activation, marked by microglial phenotypic changes, are thought to be at least partly responsible for triggering, or driving, the progression of the neurodegenerative cascade in AD.
This AD cascade, supported by biomarker observations, posits that Aβ deposition is followed by intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) leading to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation and neurodegeneration
As the proteostasis dysfunction progressively leads to a neurodegenerative state, the microglia and other immune cells start proliferating, and in the final disease stages, microglial signaling overwhelms the CNS
In reality, however, the gradual development of AD pathology, initiating with Aβ deposition and progressing to synaptic deficits, tauopathy, immune activation, and neurodegeneration, is not necessarily linear
It is notable that both Aβ and tau aggregates are often found in cognitively normal aged people, which seems to suggest that some individuals may be more resilient to the pathology and its sequelae
Over the last decade, the role of microglial activation phenotypes as a critical non-cell-autonomous process that contributes to the onset and progression of the neurodegenerative cascade has been slowly coming into focus.
Initial studies characterized inflammatory events as merely reactive gliosis, or responses to increasing Aβ or tau proteinopathy in the brain
Preclinical studies where microglial function has been altered using various modalities have given us somewhat disparate results, with some groups reporting glial activation as beneficial and others showing that this is detrimental (Table
However, given that clinical trials with anti-inflammatory drugs have had no substantial benefits in AD patients
More importantly, recent functional genomic and transcriptomic data seem to suggest a more complex scenario.
Genome-wide association studies have revealed that several immune gene variants, albeit occurring very rarely in the general population, modify AD risk, and preclinical studies indicate that these could be loss-of-function mutations
In fact, now it is thought that early microglial activation may be protective in AD
In fact, preclinical studies from our group have shown that inflammatory microglial signaling is not amyloidogenic per se in young mice bearing Aβ plaques
This would fit with the observations that microglia assume a dysfunctional senescent phenotype in the later stages of AD
Other studies have hinted at progressive changes in gene expression patterns that underlie this conversion of homeostatic microglia to a neurotoxic phenotype
Based on histopathological studies showing that microglial numbers increase steadily in early stages of AD and then subside in mature phases of the disease
It is tempting to suggest that much like the studies in radiation biology showing the limitations of linear dose-response theory
How these various phases of microglial activation overlap with proteinopathy typically preceding brain organ failure, leading to either a benign (i.e., patients with neuropathology but limited dementia
We have previously characterized this complex dynamic relationship as immunoproteostasis, a portmanteau of the words "immunity" and "proteostasis" (Fig.

Microglial Gene Variants Alter Risk of AD
Following tremendous technical advances in next-generation genomic technologies over the past decade, several new genetic risk factor genes for sporadic AD, which are predominantly of microglial origin, have been identified through multiple iterations of genome-wide association (GWA) analyses
Some of these immune function-related susceptibility genes include ABCA7, BIN1, CLU, CTSB, CTSD, CR1, EPHA1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB1, INPP5A, MS4A, and PICALM.
It is important to note that several of these risk genes actually implicate the entire locus as related to AD risk, which leaves a considerable knowledge gap in determining the mechanistic role of specific immune genes in AD progression.
Several recently identified risk factors such as TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), CD33, PILRA (paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha), and PLCG2 (phospholipase C γ-2) are exclusively myeloid in origin
Though the function of many of these immune genes remains to be characterized, limited data available indicates that the AD-associated TREM2 mutations lead to reduced microglial signaling and activity
Genetic risk locus involvement, together with preclinical and biomarker data, has spurred a recent hypothesis for AD
It states that an initial "biochemical" phase characterized by proteostasis abnormalities leads to accumulation of protein aggregates, which then act as immune stressors leading to a "cellular" phase driven predominantly by immune dysfunction and neurovascular abnormalities.
These phases, which take decades to evolve, finally lead to neurodegeneration or the clinical phase which is marked by dementia
If this hypothesis were to correctly predict the evolution of the AD cascade, given that many cognitively normal aged individuals show detectable protein aggregates in their brains, how anti-inflammatory therapies could be tested in a safe window of opportunity without causing undue bystander toxicity is still a conundrum.
Even with the frenetic pace of preclinical and clinical data emerging, how each of these risk factors of microglia/myeloid origin participates in brain organ health deterioration and clinical symptoms is highly debated (Box 1).
Another important question is how these risk factors prompt the microglia to transition from a homeostatic to a maladaptive response in AD.
Other critical questions in this regard are the following:
Comparison of upregulated gene expression profiles for PIG (blue), ARM (yellow), MGnD (gray), and DAM (pink) microglial populations demonstrates the overlap and dis-similarities in gene profiles and highlights the central role APOE plays in these populations.

Inflammatory Processes and AD: Lessons from Preclinical Models of Amyloidosis
Neuroinflammation, on a facile level, refers to microgliosis and astrocytosis in the brain surrounding extracellular Aβ deposits and neuritic plaques
With the recent knowledge that the microglial activation continuum in the brain goes beyond simplistic designations of the peripheral immunity-derived M1/M2 designation
The Aβ deposits composed of aggregated Aβ peptide also contain co-aggregating proteins, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), ubiquitin, and complement factors.
These are collectively known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
Interestingly, many of these plaqueassociated proteins are themselves secreted by microglia and astrocytes and, in most cases, they are very immunogenic
Interaction between these Aβ-associated DAMP factors and immune cells in the brain (microglia and astrocytes) can initiate a sterile inflammation response, at least in cell culture and mouse models
Transcriptomic data from APP overexpression models from multiple laboratories have shown that immune activation and immunity-associated degenerative pathways are the major networks perturbed in these mouse models
This pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the immune pathway in mouse models of Aβ is quite similar to the signature observed in human AD patients
Overall, this suggests that Aβ-driven microglial inflammatory signaling is a pervasive signaling mechanism that is associated with the early phases of the AD cascade.
It has been hypothesized that Fig.
Microglia functions in tissue surveillance, cycling between activation states and homeostasis states throughout life, beginning in neonatal ages.
During mid-life, several genetic (one being APOE) or environmental risk factors (lifestyle, metabolic diseases, stress, peripheral inflammation, for example) can potentially influence the balance of glial function in the brain.
During this time, AD-typical neuropathology, such as Aβ and tau, also initiates in the brain and could incite glial activation.
Aligned with proteostasis failure that results from the increasing neuropathological burden, immune phenotypes such as DAM, MGnD, ARM, and PIG could surface at this time, probably initiating a non-reversible immunoproteostasis phase (see
This immunoproteostasis paradigm reflects the complex relationship between microglia activity and evolving proteinopathy in the brain, characterized by context-dependent changes in microglial gene expression patterns.
Whether these microglial profiles are related to disease staging is yet unknown (see Box 1).
This transition from a prodromal to a clinical stage is thought to be characterized by loss of microglial homeostasis, reduced systemic resilience, and neurodegeneration, designated as a transition from a biochemical to a cellular phase (see
Loss of microglial homeostasis is worsened by chronic engagement of several AD-related microglial risk factors, such as TREM2/TYROBP, MS4A, INPP5D, CR1, SPI1, and CD33, with APOE playing a crucial role in inter-cellular communication.
This is thought to gradually lead to a chronic activation state of the microglia and functional senescence, and subsequently, resulting in neurodegeneration and brain organ failure.
The pictogram uses icons from Microsoft PowerPoint, and images (neuron and microglia) are from Smart Servier Medical Art (smart.servier.com:
CC license) such a dysfunctional glial response on a chronic level could subsequently induce tauopathy and neuritic plaques leading to neurodegeneration
According to this sequence of events, referred to broadly as the amyloid cascade hypothesis
Direct mechanistic evidence that immune signaling brought on by Aβ deposition plays a role in trigging tau proteinopathy and functional decline remains limited.
Some preclinical data has suggested that inflammatory reactions could also lie upstream of Aβ deposition, modulating the early formation of Aβ deposits
Rodent data that supports this hypothesis came from some notable studies, such as the study showing that reducing NLRP3 inflammasome activity in APP/PS1 mice reduced Aβ plaques
Another study reported that deficiency of TREM2, a microglial receptor, reduces immune activation and lowered Aβ burden in mice
However, data from other laboratories have firmly established that glial activation does not trigger formation of Aβ plaques and can instead confer a beneficial effect by activating microglial Aβ phagocytosis
Indeed, more recent data in diverse amyloid models has established that microglia can function either to facilitate phagocytic clearance of Aβ-associated DAMPs or to limit peri-plaque neuritic pathology
With the identification of several microglial genes (e.g., TREM2) whose loss-of-function variants increase AD risk
Taking TREM2 as an example, most of the published data show that in mouse models, microglial TREM2 limits Aβ plaque deposition
Interestingly, though having functional TREM2 limits plaque accumulation in APP/PS1 mice relative to mice lacking microglial TREM2, this effect is lost in older mice
It would thus appear that though the activation of TREM2-expressing microglia is effective in reducing plaques early on, this beneficial effect of phagocytic clearance is overwhelmed at older ages as mice accumulate saturation levels of Aβ deposits.
A similar outcome was observed in the CRND8 model of Aβ deposition where expressing the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from birth induced microglial activity that slowed Aβ deposition early in life before the beneficial effect was overwhelmed as Aβ deposits rapidly increase with age
On the other hand, expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in APP mice increased Aβ deposition through various mechanisms including upregulation of murine ApoE
It is notable that ApoE secreted by microglia (as well as astrocytes) that might be beneficial in compaction and phagocytic clearance of Aβ early on
In fact, several labs have identified microglial APOE as a factor that determines whether microglia remain in homeostasis or become activated in ways that cause tissue damage and neurodegeneration
This microglial phenotype is now known as DAM
It is important to remember that ApoE is predominantly produced by astrocytes and microglia, so this would imply that the neurodegenerative process is precipitated by a concerted dysfunction of both neurons and these glial cells.
One consistent theme that emerges from these somehow disparate studies (summarized in Table
A recent report tackles this question in two mouse models that express physiological levels of Aβ (rather than APP overexpression).
Here, the authors show that cerebral dyshomeostasis related to aberrant glutamate signaling precipitates Aβ deposition with microgliosis following the accumulation of deposits
This is consistent with the proposed hypothetical timeline
Further, using microglial depletion strategies, it becomes apparent that dysfunction in phagocytic microglia drives further synaptic abnormalities
Taken together, these data suggest complex interactions between inflammatory activation of microglia and the deposition of Aβ in which there may be some scenarios where the inflammatory reaction could attenuate Aβ pathology through the phagocytosis process and in other scenarios where this could drive the pathological sequelae following Aβ deposition.

Inflammatory Processes and AD: Lessons from Preclinical Models of Tauopathy
As summarized in the previous sections and Table
Microglia, through its phagocytotic function, can help the brain prune and repair neuronal synapses during development
Some studies have provided evidence that phagocytosed tau within microglia can be secreted through exosomes, exacerbating tauopathy
Several other studies in mice have produced direct evidence that glial activation may induce tauopathy
Another group used a complementary approach in htau mice, i.e., depleted CNS microglia at different ages (young or old), and then in a subgroup of mice, repopulated the depleted niche with peripheral macrophages.
In both instances, they did not observe any changes in tau levels
This study also examined the microglial phenotype in 22-month-old htau mice and did not observe any microglial signature associated with damaged microglia (DAM phenotype)
However, a previous study showed that pharmacologic depletion of microglia prevents tau spread in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) model and the PS19 model of tauopathy
Other studies have shown that while glial activation may increase levels of hyperphosphorylated tau, it does not necessarily induce intracellular tangles
We reported that expression of the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ from birth increases the hyperphosphorylation of tau in rTg4510 mice
Our data using CNS overexpression of IFN-γ in rTg4510 mice is consistent with a report that showed similar results using injection of lipopolysaccharide, an agonist for the microglial receptor TLR4
Taken together, such studies add to the as yet undetermined role of microglia and its relationship to different co-occurring proteinopathies in AD.
The disparate nature of the relationship between microgliosis and tauopathy that emerges from these studies is very much recapitulated in mouse models of TREM2, a major immune risk factor for AD
Loss of functional TREM2, which generally leads to reduced microgliosis
This latter study also showed that the AD-associated R47H mutant TREM2 reduces microgliosis and facilitates tau seeding associated with Aβ deposits
In a pure model of tauopathy, this AD-associated TREM2 variant showed neuroprotective properties (reduced atrophy) when compared to the common variant
Together with the data that show that ablating microglia speeds up tau seeding
Given that TREM2 deficiency by itself is related to neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism
Several studies have investigated how other factors impact tauopathy in mouse models.
One study showed that microglial APOE drives inflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in a tau transgenic mouse model, without directly affecting tau phosphorylation levels or inducing tangle pathology
Two studies showed that LPS induced microgliosis in the 3xTg-AD model (displaying both Aβ and ptau pathology) and increased ptau
Overall, whether microglial activation directly contributes to the generation and accumulation of AD-type pathological tau remains uncertain.
While a facile explanation for such disparate observations could simply be attributed to different rodent models used in these studies, a more nuanced and physiologically relevant issue should not be overlooked.
Most, if not all, of the preclinical models overexpress mutant tau which is mechanistically unrelated to AD. Importantly, the inflammatory milieu in AD brains is probably driven by Aβ and immunogenic factors coalesced within extracellular plaques.
Thus, the pathological synergy between Aβ and inflammation could trigger signaling networks leading to the emergence and spread of tauopathy, which cannot be fully appreciated in pure tauopathy models.

The Dichotomous Effects of Aβ and Tau on the Inflammatory Milieu
It is clear from the ongoing discussion that Aβ and tau could potentially affect glial homeostasis differentially if present together or by itself.
One of the caveats of the rich preclinical data on immune activation paradigms and AD neuropathology is that these studies have mostly been done in either Aβ or tauopathy models separately.
Several studies, including data from our group, provide justification for why these studies should be performed in mouse models with mixed Aβ and tau pathologies.
In mouse models with concomitant Aβ and tau (5xFADxTau22
Because human data also confirms that Aβ and tau co-exist for years before the appearance of intracellular tangles
However, preclinical data shows that glial signaling affects Aβ and tau in dichotomous ways, when studied in isolation.
We showed that CNS expression of IFN-γ and IL-6 both reduce Aβ plaques in young APP TgCRND8 mice
But IFN-γ increases tau phosphorylation
Similar results have been noted in fractalkine, IL-1, TREM2, and TYROBP models
Though microglial activation pathways do not likely trigger sporadic AD, the amyloid cascade hypothesis
Supported by human biomarker data, there is wide agreement that Aβ proteostasis dysfunction occurs first, followed by accumulation of soluble or phosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, and neurodegeneration
This opens up the premise whether glial activation that closely follows the appearance of Aβ deposition is the missing link between Aβ deposition and subsequent neuritic pathology.
This is supported by data from the 3xTg-AD model (displaying both Aβ and ptau) where LPS injection induced microgliosis and increased ptau
In another study on 3xTg-AD mice, downregulation of TNF signaling through siRNA-mediated depletion of TNFRII increased both Aβ and tau, though a similar knockdown strategy for TNFRI did not have any significant effect

Microglia at the Intersection of Systemic and Brain Immunity
An important aspect of microglial functionality is that it could be influenced by chronic systemic inflammation that occurs in normal aging.
This phenomenon is known as inflammaging, a portmanteau of "inflammation" and "aging," characterized by low-level chronic inflammatory signaling in the systemic circulation
Intriguing links between systemic cytokine overproduction and age-progressive neuropsychiatric dysfunction have been noted -especially, increased plasma cytokine levels of IL-6 is shown to be associated with age-progressive functional decline and cognitive impairment.
Indeed, IL-6 is a reliable predictor of morbidity and mortality in old age
While the link between systemic cytokines and all-cause dementia has been documented
Some recent evidence, albeit controversial, ties chronic systemic inflammatory disorders such as periodontitis and herpes infection with AD
Metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes and obesity, could also potentially affect systemic inflammatory status and integrity of the blood-brain barrier and influence progressive changes in brain immunity and cognition in AD
A recent paper showed that diet-induced diabetes in transgenic mice co-expressing the APP and MAPT genes leads to microglial dysfunction, impairs microglial engagement around Aβ plaques in mice brains, and increases neuritic plaque load
However, more systematic studies will need to be done to establish the relationship between these metabolic syndromes arising from peripheral immune activation leading to age-progressive deterioration in brain immune homeostasis and AD neuropathological cascade.

Aging-Associated Microglial Dysfunction and AD
Normal aging is associated with dysregulation of immune response, described as immunosenescence
Immunosenescence broadly refers to aging-related functional changes in the immune system, including reduced phagocytic activities of neutrophils, limited diversity in B/T cell repertoire, T cell exhaustion, and chronic production of inflammatory cytokines or inflammaging.
So far, the effects of inflammaging and immunosenescence have been well-characterized for the peripheral immune system but not so for the brain.
Chronic viral infections of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) lead to immunosenescence with aging
But not much is known about how these processes affect the brain and its immune milieu during aging and emergence of AD dementia.
During normal aging, microglia can undergo replicative senescence.
This state is characterized by telomere shortening, accumulation of lipofuscin, reduced arborization and motility, reduced phagocytic response, increased inflammatory cytokine production, and abnormal upregulation of MHC II
Intriguingly, recent data indicates that a surprisingly higher proportion of cognitively normal individuals progressively accumulate AD-similar microglial changes during aging
This would suggest that aging-induced immune homeostasis failure may precede AD-typical brain organ failure by decades.
This is also supported by the finding of histologically unique microglia subsets in the aging brain.
These microglia are thought to correspond to some form of functionally dystrophic or senescent phenotype that is associated with iron dyshomeostasis
These microglia show unique morphological characteristics, for example, spheroidal swellings and beaded tortuous processes which are conspicuously fragmented.
Senescence-associated changes in microglia were noted to precede tau neuropathology
Interestingly, dystrophic microglia were highly abundant in AD patients carrying the AD risk-associated TREM2 mutation
Additionally, other types of dysfunctional microglia have recently been characterized based on ultrastructure or differential patterns of gene expression
An interesting pathology-associated subtype that has gained recent attention is the "dark microglia"
These microglia, first observed with an electron microscope, display condensed and electron-dense nucleoplasm [131] but do not have obvious apoptotic or necrotic lesions
These microglia make intimate contact with cerebral vasculature as well as synaptic clefts, suggesting functional integration with maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and synaptic function, two main sites of degeneration in the AD brain
It is important to note that these morphologically altered microglia have been observed in aging brains also, and thus could arise independently of Aβ and tau.
While such morphologically dystrophic microglia are frequently observed in the brains of AD patients as well as in Lewy body dementia and limbic-predominant agerelated TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE)
Recently, in an experimental model of tauopathy, senescent microglia and astrocytes, characterized by the canonical senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, were identified
Such β-galactosidase-positive cells were also identified in the forebrain of an amyloid model of AD
In this model, cellular senescence was regulated by the cGAS-STING pathway, which is associated with immune activation [136] -thus linking immune activation with glial senescence in the context of AD neuropathology.
While ultrastructure and histopathological analyses of microglia have allowed us to phenotypically characterize microglia in healthy and diseased brains [127], the recent advances in single-cell gene expression technologies have allowed us deeper and context-specific understanding of the microglia as a collection of heterogeneous cells whose function is continually evolving in synchrony with brain organ health.
In the next few sections, we will describe how recent information from genomic and transcriptomic analysis has allowed us to phenotypically characterize microglia in AD.

Transcriptomics at the Level of Single Cell Focused on Specific Areas of Interest Allows Us to Identify Heterogeneity at the Molecular Level
In recent years, single-cell (sc)
A deeper understanding of this heterogeneity will be essential for developing targeted therapeutics that might be effective in the relatively small, yet highly consequential populations of microglial cells that respond to Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration.
In scRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or snRNA-seq, individual cells (or nuclei) are captured with their transcripts subsequently isolated and barcoded.
Additionally, for spatial transcriptomics, spatially arrayed barcodes are overlaid on tissue sections prior to transcript isolation.
These two types of studies are complementary to each other as well as to traditional bulk RNA sequencing approaches.
With single-cell or single-nucleus isolation, transcript levels are examined in individual cells, allowing unique insights into cell populations that may be of low abundance within the larger context of the brain; however, the spatial resolution related to the location and environment of the cell is lost.
On the other hand, while spatial data is captured in a spatial transcriptomic analysis, resolution at the level of a single cell is lacking.
Together, these approaches provide a greater deal of resolution than traditional bulk RNA-seq studies but are more expensive and require specialized equipment and may, depending on sequencing depth, only detect abundant transcripts
Nevertheless, these technologies can inform traditional RNA-seq datasets.
Cell type-specific marker genes -gene(s) whose expression is strongly enriched in a single cell type -can classify proportions of cell populations in bulk RNA-seq data.
Furthermore, multiple deconvolution methods utilize results from scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq studies to identify cell-specific changes within bulk gene expression datasets
By applying these techniques to the study of microglia function in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, we now recognize the tremendous heterogeneity of microglia populations in the normal and aging brain and that there are specialized subpopulations of microglia that are diseasespecific and, in the case of AD, closely associated with areas of amyloid plaques or neurodegeneration
Such regional and temporal heterogeneity in microglia has important ramifications as to context-dependent response
However, it is important to note that when applied to the study of glial cell populations in the brain, the methods used to isolate the cells may cause artifactual changes in gene expression unrelated to the disease process
Nevertheless, these evolving technologies have revolutionized our view of microglia as having either resting (M0), pro-(M1), or anti-(M2) inflammatory profiles

Transcriptomic Data Provide Systems-Level Insights into Microglial Phenotypes in the AD Cascade
While preclinical modeling of immunity in transgenic AD mouse models has enriched our scientific knowledge as to the involvement of microglial signaling in AD, the recent spate of multidisciplinary international collaborative efforts using principles of systems biology has provided unique insights into microglial function as never before
These unbiased exploratory approaches using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets could eventually lead to a deeper understanding of the functional importance of microglial activation states in the AD cascade, though knowledge gaps remain as to the overlaps between the different activation states as well as their functional concordance with disease stages (Box 1).
In the next sections, we describe the current state of the knowledge on microglial transcriptomic data and how this has enriched our understanding of the diversity in microglial signaling pathways in AD (Fig.

Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Several Unique Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Microglia Phenotypes

Homeostatic Microglia
Homeostatic or resting state microglia constantly surveil the brain, hunting for injury or insult, and express a transcriptional repertoire that includes transmembrane proteins and receptors involved in sensing and responding to environmental signals (the sensome) [149] and rely on TGF-β signaling
Nearly universally, microglia that are associated with inflammatory states or are responsive to injury downregulate homeostatic gene expression signatures.
Homeostatic microglia themselves appear to also display heterogeneity
Multiple studies have identified at least two homeostatic microglia subpopulations which are present at roughly equivalent numbers in the normal state
There is considerable overlap between the two homeostatic microglial populations in terms of their gene expression profile with well-studied microglial genes (TMEM119, P2RY12, CX3CR1) common in both cell subpopulations.
However, one of these subpopulations of homeostatic microglia (H2M) may be more sensitive to aging as they are present at slightly lower levels in older mice and may be primed to respond more rapidly to an activated state

Disease-Associated Microglia
Single-cell sequencing from normal and AD brains identified a unique population of protective microglia called the diseaseassociated microglia (DAM)
DAMs make up a small (~7% combined) proportion of the microglia surveyed and are hypothesized to be a protective subtype of microglia that are activated in a progressive, two-step process that requires TREM2-independent and TREM2-dependent stages.
The first, TREM2-independent stage initiates with a downregulation of homeostatic genes (CX3CR1, P2RY12, TMEM119) and upregulation of AD-associated genes (APOE, CTSB, CTSD).
The subsequent TREM2-dependent stage of DAM activation involves upregulation of genes involved in phagocytosis and lipid metabolism (CST7, LPL).
In mouse models of amyloid deposition and in the human AD brain, these cells are closely associated with Aβ deposits and are hypothesized to actively participate in remodeling Aβ plaques.
Many genes involved in DAM activation are also microglial genes previously implicated in AD via genome-wide association study (GWAS) -these include APOE, TREM2, CST7, and LPL.
Importantly, this microglial population is likely not specific to Aβ pathology as a similar population was found in mouse models of ALS, FTD, and CK-p25
These microglial genes could possibly be responsible for maintaining proper checkpoints along the activation pathway which could prevent uncontrolled microglial activation.

MGnD Neurodegenerative Microglia
The MGnD cluster of microglia, distinct from homeostatic microglia, was identified in mouse models of ALS, AD, and multiple sclerosis
This microglial population arises in response to degenerating/apoptotic neurons inducing the TREM2-APOE pathway along with suppression of the TGF-β pathway involved in regulating homeostatic microglial function.
Progression of microglia to the MGnD neurodegenerative phenotype involves the downregulation of homeostatic genes and upregulation of at least 28 inflammatory genes, including APOE.
As MGnD microglia closely associate with Aβ plaques and dystrophic neurites, they are thought to form a microenvironment which may influence disease progression and provide a potential therapeutic target via the TREM2-APOE pathway.
Given that this microglial population was identified across multiple neurodegenerative models, MGnD, like DAMs, may represent a general response to neurodegenerative insults.

Activated Response Microglia
snRNA-seq of microglial cells in a progressive amyloid mouse model identified two distinct microglial subpopulations -activated response microglia (ARM) and interferon response microglia (IRM) -that are activated during normal aging
Among these two profiles, only the ARM population responds to Aβ deposition.
IRMs are highly enriched in genes involving the innate immune response and interferon response pathways.
Other microglial populations were identified in this study including the transiting response microglia (TRM), which had a similar transcriptional profile to the ARMs, albeit at lower levels, and the cycling and proliferating microglia (CPM), which made up a very small percentage of the overall microglial population.
ARMs express genes involved in inflammatory processes, MHC class II presentation, and tissue regeneration -a number of which overlap with previously identified AD GWAS hits including APOE and TREM2.
During normal aging, the ARMs make up approximately 10% of all microglia, but in the presence of Aβ, ARMs become the major microglial subtype.
In the area surrounding amyloid plaques, microglia are the major source of APOE expression and depleting APOE prevents the ARM (but not IRM) response to amyloid.
However, as only amyloid models were investigated in this study

Plaque-Induced Genes
A comprehensive spatial transcriptomic study from the De Strooper lab
The OLIG module is not modulated by Aβ deposition whereas the PIG module is highly sensitive to Aβ.
The PIG module is composed of several cell types and involves 57 genes which regulate the complement cascade and downstream pathways and partially overlaps with genes identified in A1 astrocyte population
The PIG module highlights the coordinated cross talk between astrocytes and microglia and is regulated by APOE, TREM2, and members of the complement cascade pathway.
Like the ARM population, it is unknown whether the PIG response is restricted to Aβ deposition as only amyloid mouse models were used in this investigation.
One important aspect that is highlighted from these transcriptomic studies is that different types of protein deposits or species may alter the microglial DEG in unique ways.
In a recent study from our lab [158], we studied transcriptional responses in primary cultured microglia to amyloid conformations in vitro and compared these to bulk RNAseq dataset obtained from the APP transgenic TgCRND8 mice of different ages.
The TgCRND8 mice produce both Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides resulting in a mix of cored and diffuse amyloid deposits.
In these mice, the patterns of microglial response to the Aβ proteinopathy were progressive but the signature remained consistent throughout the life of the mouse, irrespective of the quantitative variation of the type of Aβ deposits.
Interestingly, in the primary microglia cultures treated with different forms of Aβ conformers, we identified distinctive microglial profiles corresponding to fibrillar, monomeric, or oligomeric forms of Aβ.
We found increased homeostatic microglial gene expression profile in microglia treated with fibrillar Aβ42 for 12 h, which was not seen following 12-h treatment of oligomeric Aβ42 or 1-h treatment of fibrillar Aβ42.
Transcriptional profiles corresponding to the MGnD signature
Intriguingly, ARM
With the caveat that primary cultures are often not reflective of in vivo molecular changes
Such data can provide us insights into the evolution of microglial dysfunction in the continuum of neuropathological changes in the AD brain.
Together, these studies highlight the convergence of select subpopulations of amyloid-responsive microglia on the APOE/TREM2 pathway (Fig.
These data show how the microglial DEGs evolve with proteinopathy deposits and emergence of neurodegenerative signals.
While many of the identified microglial populations share similar transcriptional profile and affected pathways, there are considerable differences among these profiles.
Such differences could be due to a number of factors including the techniques used to isolate the cells and the various experimental models used in identifying the cell populations.
As to the different nomenclatures of microglial activation signatures reported by various research groups, it should be noted that these all represent similar morphological activation states of microglia and caution should be warranted in further interpreting these profiles.
Indeed, though all of these studies have reported transcriptionally homogenous microglial clusters, data from a recent study points to a transcriptional continuum, especially as it relates to homeostatic microglia
It is possible that the differences (and similarities) in these profiles are more reflective of the experimental methodology and the experimental model used to characterize these signatures.
In general, the systems-level changes in rodent models are characterized in binary forms (presence or absence of statistical significant DEG), whereas, in actual human brain, the neurodegenerative cascade may be more complex and contextually unique.
Thus, additional work is needed to determine to what degree the functions of these microglial populations overlap; whether these populations represent broad (or, perhaps, more disease-specific) responses to amyloid, tau, synaptic pathology, and neurodegeneration; whether differences in gene expression profiles drive specific functions of the microglia; and what their functional significance is to the AD cascade in humans.

Relationship Between Genetic Linkage Data and Microglial Gene Expression
Many of the disease-associated variants identified in GWA studies do not result in deleterious changes in the proteincoding region of the gene
In such cases, no obvious function can be assigned to the variant and they are oftentimes found in strong linkage disequilibrium with surrounding variants such that any variant within the haplotype could be the functional/causative culprit.
Because of this, a mechanism involving the regulation of gene expression is invoked to explain the functional consequences of these variants.
Interpretation of these non-coding variants in the context of genome-wide gene expression levels of the parent genes results in the concept of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).
Identification of eQTLs is aided by large-scale projects unrelated to AD brain analysis, such as ENCODE [160], the Epigenome RoadMap [161], RegulomeDB [162], and GTEx
In a broad GWA study of adult neurological disorders, over 20% of associated SNPs were identified as brain cis-eQTLs localized within 1 Mb of the target gene
Variants also exert effects on transcript levels over a greater distance -greater than 1 Mb from the location of the SNP -and in AD almost 30% of non-coding variants reside in enhancer regions and are thought to act by modulating the higher-order chromatin
Generally, these studies indicate that an AD-associated SNP can have either local (cis-eQTL) or long-range (trans-eQTL) regulatory effects on the expression of other genes.
In AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, effects of AD-associated GWA variants affect the expression of microglia-enriched genes in brain-resident microglia as well as in immune cells in the blood.
Some ADrisk variants found in microglial genes CD33 and C2AP were identified as their own eQTL in the brain as these influenced their own expression levels
Other local effects of eQTLs on microglial gene expression are demonstrated by the influence of AD-associated SNPs localized in ZCWPW1, but which affected the expression of PILRB
Notably, in myeloid cells, the absence of PILRB increases cytokine production resulting in inflammatory responses in the brain
AD risk variants in the CELF1 haplotype affect the expression of SPI1
Low levels of SPI1 expression is linked to delayed AD onset
Cell type-specific QTL (ct-eQTL) analysis can reveal the effects of SNPs on small populations of cells within the brain.
By incorporating proxy genes representing specific cell types into the model that identifies eQTLs, this approach has identified the influence of genetic loci on gene expression that are lost with a traditional eQTL.
Using this approach, gene-SNP eQTL pairs were identified in interferon-responsive pathways in myeloid cells in the blood and brain -ct-eQTL signals that were lost when using a conventional eQTL approach
A separate approach utilized cell type-specific expression datasets from scRNA-seq analysis of microglia to identify a putative regulatory role for a genetic risk variant in BIN1 on its expression levels
With larger sample sizes, this approach could be applied to identify genetic variants that directly affect specific population of microglia responsive to Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration.
SNPs in a single gene or haplotype can have broader effects than the relatively local effects on the expression of their own or neighboring genes as described above.
This can be mapped onto a co-expression network.
Such network analyses using genome-wide expression data show that genes that are expressed together are often co-regulated.
By combining co-expression networks with eQTL analyses, recent studies have underscored the importance of this systems approach.
Notably, though RBFOX1 is a neuronally expressed RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA metabolism in neurons, the RBFOX1 modQTL SNP can affect the expression of microglial genes that comprise this co-expression module
Additionally, variants in RBFOX1 have been previously associated with increased amyloid-related positron emission tomography (PET) signals
Another study,
Collectively, these studies highlight the effects that genetic variation can have on microglia-specific gene expression.
Importantly, these QTL studies indicate that genetic variability in microglial gene expression levels can alter their responses to amyloid and can significantly affect the risk for AD.
Furthermore, such gene-SNP QTL pairs represent potential therapeutic targets for controlling microglial inflammatory responses to AD-typical changes.

Proteomic Approaches Reveal Immune Factors Associated with Disease Progression
Activated microglia and astrocytes are found in close association with protein inclusions in post-mortem analysis of AD patient brains.
Since these analyses are done in a crosssectional manner, these outcomes reflect the agonal state of the brain and the catastrophic level of brain organ failure occurring at the end stage of a patient's life.
This would explain why immune signaling emerges as the overwhelmingly predominant pathway in the transcriptional studies done in patient brains.
However, this does not explain how, if at all, immune signaling influences the development and progression of the disease and whether altered brain immunity plays a differential role in asymptomatic healthy aging and in symptomatic AD population.
Another issue to consider is that protein levels cannot always be inferred from RNA levels
Indeed, global co-expression analyses fail to show high degrees of overlap between proteome and transcriptome networks in AD
In other cases, disease phenotypes have been shown to better correlate with post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications which are not reflected in the RNA or genomic data
Additionally, some of the differentially expressed genes or proteins coded by risk factors are differentially compartmentalized as the disease progresses.
A prime example of this is the APOE protein (produced by astrocytes and microglia mainly), which directly binds to
Other examples include immune factors such as midkine and netrin 1, which because of their affinity to Aβ, co-localize with extracellular plaques
Recent advances in proteomics and metabolomics have started to address the ante-mortem biological alterations leading to disease phenotype and neuropathological trajectory.
In the next pages, we will briefly discuss proteomic data in the context of immune activation, but for a comprehensive viewpoint of metabolomics as AD biomarkers, the readers are directed to these excellent publications
Ultrasensitive and high-throughput mass spectrometry using either label-free methods or isobaric labeling methods have been used to analyze the proteome from brains, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma of AD patients at different stages of the disease
Such unbiased or even targeted proteome analysis could potentially identify biological pathways that help us define disease stages and characterize pathways affecting disease progression.
This knowledge, along with genetic or epigenetic risk factors in an individual, could help us generate a framework for targeted therapeutics in vulnerable populations.
These mass spectrometric studies have been done on different patient cohorts such as Goizueta ADRC
Network analysis of protein co-expression modules shows that cell type perturbations, driven by increased presence of glia-enriched modules and reduction in neuronal modules, characterize most of these datasets.
Interestingly, one proteomic dataset reported the appearance of a protective "anti-inflammatory" glial response in patients in early stages of AD [184], followed later by the emergence of a module indicative of vascular-mediated inflammation
Integrative analysis of mass spectrometry and multi-omic dataset pathways from patients at different disease stages identified several pathways, including amyloid cascade, immunity, complement, WNT (Wingless/Integrated) signaling, TGF-β and BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling, lipid metabolism, iron homeostasis, and membrane transport
This study investigated cognitively normal samples with high or low Aβ burden, mild cognitively impaired patients, AD patients, and primary tauopathy patients and identified three distinct proteome clusters that were temporally regulated in the AD continuum.
The innate and adaptive immune factors were upregulated early on and accumulate progressively while complement proteins remained stable early and increased much later in the disease process
This dataset was integrated with other -omics data producing a ranked order of four major categories of enriched pathways encoding Aβ/tau, immunity, growth and development, and metabolism-and membrane transport-related proteins.
Another study stratified patients into biological subtypes based on three clusters of proteome alterations indicating (i) hyperplasticity (with increased BACE1 levels), (ii) innate immune activation, and (iii) blood-brain barrier dysfunction (with low BACE1 levels)
Given that (some of) these patients were matched for genetic risk factors, comorbidities, and neuropathology severity, it would seem that these different clusters represent inherent heterogeneity in AD patients.
Since early studies in the field characterized patient subtypes based on CSF amyloid, tau, and ubiquitin levels
Another recent study of plasma proteins identified a panel of 19 "hub" proteins as part of co-expression networks correlated with disease stage-specific dysfunction
Most of the downregulated proteins in these clusters were related to inflammatory processes or apoptosis, and upregulated proteins corresponded to cell proliferation pathways and chemotaxis.
These protein clusters showed heterogeneity as some were correlated with the A/T/N signature while others did not
CSFassociated immune proteins identified from at least two studies, such as YKL-40 and sTrem2, are associated with disease severity
Some of these proteomic signatures are associated with the APOE genotype
In the future, integrating the proteomic signatures from the brain, CSF, and plasma with other omic measures could potentially lead to characterization of disease stage-specific biomarkers for AD that would be informative of the evolving continuum of microglial activation patterns during the different stages of AD dementia.
Therapies Targeting the Immune System: Hits (in Rodents) and Misses (in Clinical Trials)
Early epidemiologic data showed that aging cohorts who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for more than 2 years were protected from AD
Several trials with NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, diclofenac, nimesulide, naproxen, and rofecoxib, which showed promise in rodent proteinopathy models
Similarly, a 2-year trial using the antiinflammatory antibiotic minocycline also failed to show any clinical benefits in mild AD patients
Failure in these trials was attributed to insufficiencies in study design
In fact, long-term clinical trials with naproxen had to be halted due to emergence of cardiovascular side effects [214] and a 7-year follow-up of these enrolled patients showed no clear against dementia
Indeed, later analysis showed that anti-inflammatory therapies such as rofecoxib (marketed as Vioxx®) led to serious adverse events
Some of these NSAIDs, referred to as gamma secretase modulators, were shown to also inhibit Aβ production
However, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial on mild AD patients using one such gamma secretase modulator, tarenflurbil, also failed to correct functional decline
At this present time, there is a concern that broad therapeutic targeting of the immune system, especially in symptomatic patients, may lead to worse outcomes.
Adverse outcomes in anti-inflammatory therapies might be related to peripheral effects (such as the cardiovascular effects observed in NSAID trials), and any treatment activating the endogenous immune function could lead to CNS effects such as accelerating dementia conditions (such as those observed in sepsis or in inflammaging conditions).
Preclinical rodent studies showed that activating gliosis could reduce Aβ
Assuming that rodent studies predict human disease landscape, these preclinical data indicate the necessity of designing immune therapies specifically targeting unique disease stages and microglial phenotypes.
Fundamental differences in microglial biology in mice and humans might also confound the therapeutic translational potential of preclinical data.
Aside from the fact that the immune landscape could be distinct in mice and humans
These patients suffer from the Nasu-Hakola disease (polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy or PLOSL), which is also associated with early dementia but is primarily characterized by bone cysts
Of particular interest is that the extent of heterogeneity in microglial transcriptome signatures is much higher in humans than in rodents even in steady state
The absence of such deep layers of complexity in microglial transcription states in rodents could moderate the predictive value of preclinical studies conducted in rodents.
Systems-level data emerging from mouse models and detailed analysis of heterogeneous clinical cohorts support the presence of age-progressive and phased immune responses in the brain.
There is increasing appreciation of an AD continuum, based on the enormous genetic and biological heterogeneity in patients exhibiting clinical dementia.
These studies have led to the formation of precision medicine initiatives, such as the international Alzheimer Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI), the USA-based PMI, and the "All of Us Research Program"
Such precision medicine initiatives could, in theory, one day, integrate genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets from heterogeneous populations to efficaciously target specific pathways at specific disease stages in susceptible individuals.
There are some efforts to integrate immune components into these initiatives targeting AD patients, such as the "Korean AD Research Platform Initiative Based on Immune-Inflammatory Biomarkers" (K-ARPI)

Conclusions
The pathological role of sustained microglial signaling in AD is bolstered by both post-mortem and ante-mortem biomarker analysis in human patients showing that microglial activation is an underlying feature in AD patients
In particular, several neurotoxic damage-associated microglia-specific transcriptomic signatures have been identified in mice as well as a human-specific microglial signature observed in AD patients and in normal aging
However, in spite of the prevalent theory that microgliosis is a critical link between Aβ, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration, microglial signaling events that lead to neurodegeneration in the presence of Aβ, tau, and other co-occurring pathologies have not been defined (Box 1).
While transcriptomic signatures have revealed key pathways that are upregulated in a cell type-specific manner, how much of these changes are co-incident with functional perturbation of brain homeostasis leading to neurodegenerative changes is still unknown.
In concert with emerging proteomic signatures, such data will be transformative as we arrive at the age of personalized medicine
There is a growing consensus that chronic gliosis that is associated with Aβ plaques (as revealed by transcriptomic data from rodent Aβ models) can contribute to CNS dysfunction, though the ultimate pathological role of microglial activation in AD, as gleaned from data from individual Aβ and tau preclinical models, remains to be resolved.
Data indicates that these different microglial transcriptomic signatures identified so far in mouse models may not be fully representative of the neurodegenerative pathways in the human brain.
It is possible that the degenerative sequence in the human brain cannot be neatly explained in such experimentally well-defined signatures but rather would be a result of the system devolving into chaos where microglia deviate from their usual surveillant and phagocytic function.
In the end, we might realize that AD is not a monolithic disease and that the AD cascade does not proceed equally linear for all individuals (unlike transgenic rodent models of the disease).
This also segues to another cautionary note as the neurodegeneration-associated microglial profiles may not be completely overlapping between the rodent models and humans
Based on an individual's genetic risk factors and epigenomic perturbations, it is possible that microglial or immune signaling will play very unique roles in disease induction and progression, an aspect that may not be completely recapitulated in rodent models.
Thus, the critical question of "does activated microglia cause neurodegenerative dementias" remains unanswered.
In humans, advanced biomarker studies have helped establish the continuum of pathological changes occurring in the AD brain
Though the measures of immune activation (plasma sampling, CSF sampling, or brain imaging) are still being resolved, there is wide agreement that Aβ deposition precedes the accumulation of phosphorylated tau and neurodegeneration in AD
The question remains as to the placement of microglial signaling in this evolving cascade (Fig.
Bearing in mind that the several different types of microglial signatures and phenotypes have now been characterized, there is no need for carefully parsing out a staging system unique to microglial involvement just as has been done for the neuropathological Braak staging in the AD patient brain.
