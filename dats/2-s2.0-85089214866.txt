Thrombin, a Mediator of Coagulation, Inflammation, and Neurotoxicity at the Neurovascular Interface: Implications for Alzheimer’s Disease
The societal burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is staggering, with current estimates suggesting that 50 million people world-wide have AD.
Identification of new therapeutic targets is a critical barrier to the development of disease-modifying therapies.
A large body of data implicates vascular pathology and cardiovascular risk factors in the development of AD, indicating that there are likely shared pathological mediators.
Inflammation plays a role in both cardiovascular disease and AD, and recent evidence has implicated elements of the coagulation system in the regulation of inflammation.
In particular, the multifunctional serine protease thrombin has been found to act as a mediator of vascular dysfunction and inflammation in both the periphery and the central nervous system.
In the periphery, thrombin contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis and diabetes, by inducing endothelial dysfunction and related inflammation.
In the brain, thrombin has been found to act on endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in a manner that promotes vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and neurodegeneration.
Thrombin is elevated in the AD brain, and thrombin signaling has been linked to both tau and amyloid beta, pathological hallmarks of the disease.
In AD mouse models, inhibiting thrombin preserves cognition and endothelial function and reduces neuroinflammation.
Evidence linking atrial fibrillation with AD and dementia indicates that anticoagulant therapy may reduce the risk of dementia, with targeting thrombin shown to be particularly effective.
It is time for "outside-the-box" thinking about how vascular risk factors, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, as well as the coagulation and inflammatory pathways interact to promote increased AD risk.
In this review, we present evidence that thrombin is a convergence point for AD risk factors and as such that thrombin-based therapeutics could target multiple points of AD pathology, including neurodegeneration, vascular activation, and neuroinflammation.
The urgent need for disease-modifying drugs in AD demands new thinking about disease pathogenesis and an exploration of novel drug targets, we propose that thrombin inhibition is an innovative tactic in the therapeutic battle against this devastating disease.

INTRODUCTION
The societal burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is staggering, with current estimates suggesting that 5.8 million Americans and 50 million people world-wide have AD
Identification of new therapeutic targets is a critical barrier to our ability to develop a diseasemodifying therapy for this devastating disease.
A large body of data implicates vascular pathology and cardiovascular risk factors, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, in the development of AD.
Though the mechanisms whereby these risk factors contribute to pathological processes in the AD brain have not been defined fully, it has been suggested that inflammation plays a key role in both cardiovascular disease and AD
It is clear that a better understanding of the relationship(s) among cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, and neurodegeneration has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets in the battle against AD.
Recently, a number of laboratories have provided evidence that certain elements of the coagulation cascade may initiate and/or support inflammation in the brain
The proinflammatory properties of the protein fibrin have attracted particular attention [reviewed in
Fibrin increases expression of a number of inflammatory and oxidative mediators, activates glial cells, and disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Another potentially important protein related to both coagulation and inflammation is thrombin.
Thrombin is widely appreciated for its contribution to fibrin formation and platelet aggregation in response to vascular injury.
Importantly, thrombin is also a pleiotropic enzyme that is capable of triggering a large and diverse number of cellular events through receptor-mediated activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs)
Levels of both thrombin and the thrombin receptor PAR-1 are elevated in AD
As we discuss below, thrombin can act in both a paracrine and autocrine manner to stimulate a noxious feedforward cycle that likely contributes to neuroinflammation in the AD brain.
The evidence summarized herein suggests that thrombin is a convergence point for AD risk factors and that thrombin-based therapeutics might target multiple points of AD pathology, including neurodegeneration, vascular activation, and neuroinflammation.
We will present evidence that supports the hypothesis that thrombin could be a heretofore unexplored target for AD therapeutics.

COAGULATION AND INFLAMMATION: FUNCTIONALLY LINKED PROCESSES
Close integration and extensive crosstalk between coagulation and inflammation pathways are critical to the body's response to injury
Both processes utilize numerous bioactive mediators and cellular effectors that interact in a coordinated manner.
Inflammatory proteins, such as cytokines, play a central role in the activation of coagulation
Meanwhile major coagulation factors, such as tissue factor, fibrinogen, and thrombin, are drivers of inflammation
Under normal physiological conditions these intertwined systems work in homeostatic balance, but dysregulation of this crosstalk likely contributes to cellular injury and disease pathogenesis.

Effect of Cytokines on Coagulation
Cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-1β, stimulate procoagulant effects both directly and indirectly.
These proteins initiate the extrinsic coagulation pathway through up-regulation and activation of tissue factor
Blocking tissue factor greatly inhibits inflammation-induced thrombosis, and inhibition of IL-6 specifically blocks tissue factor-dependent thrombin generation
Cytokines, especially TNF-α, can also initiate inflammation-mediated platelet activation and clumping in the blood
Inflammatory cytokines can inhibit the anticoagulant feedback pathways, resulting in increased thrombin and fibrin production
Both TNF-α and IL-1β can reduce activated protein C (APC) via down-regulation of thrombomodulin, an important cofactor for APC's anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant activity

Coagulation Factors Drive Inflammation
Tissue factor, the main driver of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, can induce proinflammatory effects.
This includes increases in the production of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines, and growth factors
These proinflammatory effects are largely mediated through tissue factor-activation of the protease thrombin (see below).
Fibrin is the primary end-product of the coagulation system, but it also has proinflammatory characteristics.
Fibrinogen and fibrin both have been shown to induce leukocyte migration, and directly modulate the inflammatory response of both leukocytes and endothelial cells.
Fibrin induces the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Similarly, fibrin has been shown to have extensive proinflammatory effects within the central nervous system (CNS), including activation of glia and disruption of BBB function
Fibrinogen activates microglia in a CD11bdependent manner; this activation is related to perivascular clustering, axonal degeneration, spine elimination, and cognitive impairment in animal models
Finally, the coagulation and immune systems are directly linked through activation of IL-1α by thrombin

THROMBIN IS A KEY MEDIATOR OF COAGULATION AND INFLAMMATION VIA PROTEOLYTIC AND RECEPTOR-MEDIATED MECHANISMS
The coagulation cascade consists of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, and thrombin is a key mediator in both
The extrinsic system is activated by tissue factor, which is found in the subendothelial surface and is only introduced to the blood following injury.
Tissue factor in the blood complexes with factor VIIIa to initiate the cascade that will eventually lead to the formation of thrombin and the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin
The intrinsic system is activated by factor XII, which initiates a cascade that will lead to the production of thrombin via factors X and V
The activation of thrombin will also activate a positive feedback loop which will continue to drive the generation of thrombin
Together, these systems work to increase the amount of active thrombin in the blood, which will in turn increase the insoluble fibrin available to form a clot at the site of damage.
As noted above, thrombin is a multifunctional protease that can initiate many cellular events through action at and activation of PARs.
PARs are a unique class of G-protein-coupled receptors due to their unusual tethered-ligand mechanism of activation
Thrombin is responsible for enzymatic cleavage of the PAR N-terminus to expose a tethered ligand that intramolecularly activates the receptor.
Activation of PARs by thrombin affects a multitude of functions throughout the body, including the regulation of platelet activation, cell adhesion, cell migration, angiogenesis, and inflammation

The Vasculature Is a Critical Nexus for the Proinflammatory Actions of Thrombin
Thrombin moderates gene expression through a wide array signaling processes in vascular endothelial cells
Thrombin acts on endothelial cells to stimulate synthesis and release of a large number of diverse bioactive proteins.
Thrombin stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) produces changes in gene expression related to inflammation, apoptosis, and matrix integrity
Thrombin-treated HUVECs exhibit increased expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and a related increase in monocyte adhesion
In human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), thrombin and highglucose co-treatment produces increases in the expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX), inflammatory cytokines, and altered adhesion
Cultured endothelial cells exposed to thrombin release von Willebrand factor, express P-selectin at the plasma membrane, and produce chemokines thought to trigger the binding of platelets and leukocytes to endothelial surface
Thrombin can affect vessel diameter, alter endothelial cell shape, and increase permeability of the endothelial monolayer.
Endothelial cells can both release thrombin and respond to this protein via functionally active thrombin receptors (PAR-1 and PAR-3).
Thrombin causes endothelial activation and enhanced expression and/or release of many proinflammatory proteins including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), ICAM-1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, which in turn can injure endothelial cells leading to increased release of thrombin
Thus, thrombin can act in both a paracrine and autocrine manner stimulating a noxious feed-forward cycle.

THROMBIN CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S RISK FACTORS: ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND DIABETES
Given thrombin's effect on endothelial cells, it is not surprising that thrombin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Thrombin has been widely studied for its role in the pathology of atherosclerosis, a progressive and chronic inflammatory vascular disorder
A role for thrombin in the development of atherosclerosis is suggested by the observation that elevated levels of thrombin and the thrombin receptor PAR are found around atherosclerotic plaques, and that thrombin formation is correlated with disease severity in coronary atherosclerosis
Thrombin facilitates recruitment of circulating monocytes to atherosclerosis plaques by increasing expression of MCP-1, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1
The importance of thrombin is further highlighted by the finding that thrombomodulin, which inhibits thrombin by binding to it, diminishes thrombin-induced endothelial cell dysfunction in atherosclerosis
Thrombin produces damage to endothelial cell barriers causing leakiness and associated leukocyte migration
Thrombin inhibition has been shown to decrease ROS production, improve endothelial cell and barrier function, and attenuate atherosclerotic plaque formation
Thrombin activity can influence onset, progression, and qualitative properties of atherosclerotic plaques.
In atherosclerotic models, increases in thrombin have been found to be associated with increases in inflammation, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation (ten Cate, 2012;
Genetic reduction of thrombin in APOE-/-mice diminished atherosclerosis severity
Studies have further defined thrombin's role in atherosclerosis by finding reduced atherosclerosis-related pathology in animal models treated with thrombin inhibitors
On the other hand, genetic manipulations resulting in elevated thrombin levels produce exacerbated atherosclerosis-related pathology
These findings illustrate a causative role for thrombin in the development of atherosclerosis-related pathology and inflammation, largely through thrombin's endothelial cell-mediated effects.
Hyperglycemia, characteristic of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), enhances thrombin generation and promotes a hypercoagulable state and high oxidative stress
Elevated thrombin activity has been linked with endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, including vascular inflammation and increased ROS production in
One mechanism whereby thrombin promotes diabetic oxidative stress is via calcium-mediated intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the transcription factor KLF14 and PLK1 kinase pathways, resulting in increased ROS production
Exogenous thrombin treatment has been shown to exacerbate pathology in experimental models of diabetes.
In a mouse model of diabetes, thrombin treatment of pericytes results in increased barrier permeability, decreased expression of tight junction proteins, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines
Induction of diabetes by streptozotocin (STZ) in mice increases the expression of PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4 in the aorta.
STZ-induced diabetic mice show impairment of endothelial function, while the administration of dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, significantly attenuates this endothelial dysfunction
Patients with T2DM show increased blood thrombin levels correlated with the patient's level of albuminuria, an indicator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM.
This suggests that thrombin may play a role in the development of macrovascular disease
Thrombin-related pathways have also been implicated in diabetic microvascular injury and retinopathy.
Samples taken from diabetic retinopathy patients show elevated expression of thrombin and PAR-1; similar trends are found in samples from a rat model of diabetes
Obesity promotes a chronic inflammatory and hypercoagulable state that drives cardiovascular disease and T2DM.
Recent studies have suggested a link between the thrombin/fibrin (ogen) axis and obesity
In a high fat animal model, treatment with the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate ameliorates the development of obesity and severity of associated sequelae

THROMBIN CAUSES VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION AND PROMOTES INFLAMMATION IN THE BRAIN
Largely due to its proinflammatory effects on endothelial cells, thrombin has an important role in the pathology of various peripheral vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and diabetes, as reviewed above.
Thrombin may similarly act as a pathological mediator in the CNS, through effects on the endothelial cells of the BBB (Figure

Effects of Thrombin on the BBB
Consistent with its ability to cause endothelial injury in the periphery, thrombin has been found to be involved in instances of damage and dysfunction to the brain endothelial cells of the BBB.
Treatment of rat brain endothelial cells causes endothelial dysfunction characterized by increased production of ROS, nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines
In human brain endothelial cells, thrombin treatment induces an inflammatory phenotype resulting in increased ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and increased mRNA expression for CXC chemokines (chemotactic for neutrophils) CXCL1 (GRO-alpha), CXCL2 (GRO-beta) CXCL8 (IL-8), and CXCL10 (IP-10)
Thrombin also increases F-actin stress fibers, disrupts tight junctions, and increases barrier permeability
More specifically, thrombin has been found to alter barrier permeability by inducing microtubule disassembly
Treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor reduces the ROS generation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured brain endothelial cells in response to hypoxia, indicating a mediating role for thrombin in the proinflammatory response of brain endothelial cells
We have previously demonstrated that thrombin message is highly expressed in microvessels from AD brains but is not detectable in control vessels
Similarly, Western blot analysis of microvessels shows that the thrombin protein is highly expressed in AD-but not control-derived microvessels
Furthermore, injuring brain endothelial cells in vitro with oxidant stress (sodium nitroprusside) or an inflammatory cocktail (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon (IFN)-γ) results in thrombin release
Since brain endothelial cells can both synthesize and respond to thrombin, it could function as an autocrine factor at the BBB.
The importance of findings regarding the effects of thrombin on the cells of the BBB is two-fold.
Directly, thrombin damage to the BBB increases permeability and may allow damaging substances, including thrombin and other inflammatory mediators from the blood, to enter the brain.
Indirectly, these injured brain endothelial cells can produce their own thrombin into the brain, where it may have untoward effects on microglia, astrocytes and neurons (Figure

Neuroinflammatory Effects of Thrombin on Microglia and Astrocytes
The response of microglia to thrombin encompasses a number of processes that contribute to microglia activation and/or apoptosis.
In the microglial cell line BV2, thrombin induces IL-1β release
Thrombin has also been shown to stimulate a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia, characterized by increases in ROS, NO, and cytokine production
PAR-1 activation was found to participate in activation of microglia, indicated by up-regulation of microglial CD40 and TNF-α production
Thrombin, via the TNF-α/TNFR-dependent pathway, downregulates expression of the mRNA species miR-181c which in turn promotes nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity, and upregulates NF-κB target gene expression as well as increasing mixed lineage leukemia-1 (MLL1), a putative gene target for miR-181c
BV2 cells treated with thrombin show an increase in ROS and the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a component of the innate immune system, which is associated with a wide range of human CNS disorders
Astrocytes show a similar shift towards a proinflammatory phenotype in response to thrombin.
In rat brain astrocytes, thrombin induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression and promotes cell migration via activation of the c-Src/Jak2/PDGFR/PI3K/Akt/PKCδ pathway
Thrombin exposure can disrupt glutamate transport in astrocytes and modulate stellation, indicating an alteration in function
Thrombin treatment in vivo resulted in increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the hippocampus, indicating a proinflammatory activation in astrocytes

THROMBIN: AN IMPORTANT MEDIATOR OF NEUROTOXICITY AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES
The multifunctional protease thrombin causes neuronal cell death both in vitro and in vivo, and the neurotoxic effects of thrombin are orchestrated by multiple pathways.
In vitro, thrombin-induced neurotoxicity involves activation of PAR-1, followed by RhoA activation and cell cycle reentry.
In neurons treated with thrombin, cyclin D1 and E (early G1 cyclins) and the cyclin dependent kinase, cdk4, are activated and that these events lead to upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and apoptosis
Additionally, thrombin has been demonstrated to cause a rapid influx of calcium in neurons leading to neuronal cell death
Delivery of thrombin directly into the brain by intracerebral injection causes significant neuropathology, such as enlargement of cerebral ventricles, an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, astrogliosis, and an increase in the immunoreactivity for phosphorylated neurofilament and apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) fragments, as well as cognitive impairments including deficits in reference memory and an increase in task latency
The large body of data indicating thrombin is an important mediator of neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity support the idea that this protein is critically involved in pathological processes that contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), amyolaterotrophic sclerosis (ALS), ischemia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinson's disease (PD), and AD
Alterations in coagulation-related proteins have been indicated in motor-associated degenerative disorders.
Both prothrombin and factor X are elevated in MS
Proteomic analysis of chronic active MS lesions identified several dysregulated coagulation factors, highlighting a potential link between the coagulation cascade and MS pathology
In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model of MS, thrombin activity precedes onset of neurological signs, increases at disease peak, and correlates with fibrin deposition, microglial activation, demyelination, axonal damage, and clinical severity
The potential pathological significance of coagulation factors in neurological disease is underscored by the finding that the diminution of fibrin, the end product of thrombin's proteolysis, either genetically or using anticoagulants, significantly reduces neurological signs, inflammation, and axonal damage in EAE
Additionally, thrombin has been linked to changes in interneuron calcium signaling and enhanced thrombospondin release in ALS
Thrombin has been extensively studied for its role in the response to ischemia
Thrombin was found to mediate neurovascular injury during ischemia
While high concentrations of thrombin seem to be neurotoxic, low concentrations of thrombin (0.01 U/mL) were found to protect against neuronal death in cellular and animal models of ischemia
Increases in thrombin have also been associated with TBI.
Alterations in BBB permeability have been found following TBI
In a model of TBI, BBB damage due to the injury was found to induce increases in thrombin
A role for thrombin has also been identified in PD-related pathology.
More specifically, thrombin-induced activation of microglia in the midbrain has been directly linked to dopaminergic neuron death
Thrombin receptor PAR-1 is upregulated in the brains of patients with PD
Recently, our lab has identified that treatment with the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran improved motor deficits and reduced markers of oxidative stress in a Drosophila melanogaster model of PD
A role for thrombin in PD is further indicated by the finding that treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor is neuroprotective in a rotenone-induced PD rodent model
Finally, mice deficient in PAR-1 are protected against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced toxicity which causes PD-like syndrome

A CASE FOR THROMBIN AS A DRIVER OF NEURODEGENERATION AND VASCULAR ACTIVATION IN AD
Thrombin has previously been suggested as a possible pathological mediator in AD
Thrombin is associated with typical hallmarks of AD-related pathology.
Thrombin has been detected in senile plaques and in neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of this disease
TBI, a condition in which neurons are exposed to high thrombin levels, is associated with an increased incidence of AD
Thrombin may also contribute to ApoE-associated pathology in AD.
Intracerebral administration of thrombin to rodents increases ApoE levels in the hippocampus and results in neuronal injury and cognitive deficits
The 22 kDa N-terminal thrombin-cleavage fragment of ApoE is highly neurotoxic and could contribute to ApoE-associated AD pathology
Persistent thrombin signaling induces tau aggregation and related hippocampal degeneration
Thrombin induces secretion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in endothelial cells in vitro
Aβ promotes thrombin generation through factor XII-mediated factor XI activation
In this regard, depletion of factor XII ameliorates brain pathology and cognitive impairment in AD mice.
Additionally, the factor XII-initiated contact system, of which thrombin is a key driver, is activated in AD patients and mice

Vascular Activation: A Novel Pathway in AD: A Role for Thrombin
Microvessels isolated from the brains of AD patients overexpress a diverse array of neurotoxic and inflammatory proteins
Expression of these diverse mediators is consistent with the process of vascular activation and reflects the transition of endothelial cells from a quiescent to a highly synthetic phenotype
A similar pattern of vascular activation has been identified in transgenic AD animal models
Vascular activation in the AD brain has deleterious consequences for neuronal viability, as many vascular-derived factors are neurotoxic.
The idea that vascular activation contributes to pathogenic events in the AD brain is strongly supported by pre-clinical studies in two AD mouse models where treatment with a vascular activation inhibitor reduced vascular-derived neuroinflammation and improved cognitive performance
Several lines of evidence support the idea that the cerebral vasculature is a convergence point for both the expression of thrombin as well as thrombin-mediated effects that contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury in AD.
While the majority of thrombin is produced in the liver, extrahepatic sources of locally generated thrombin, including in the brain, have been documented
Although not widely appreciated, evidence suggests the cerebrovasculature is an important source of thrombin in AD.
Immunoreactivity for the major brain thrombin inhibitor, protease nexin-1, is found to be significantly decreased in AD brains, particularly around blood vessels, suggesting vascular release of thrombin
As previously stated, thrombin mRNA and protein are expressed in brain microvessels from AD patients but not detectable in brain microvessels isolated from age-matched control brains
It is not surprising that thrombin is expressed in ADderived brain microvessels, as in vitro experiments with brain endothelial cells have shown that injuring these cells causes release of thrombin
Because brain endothelial cells not only produce thrombin in response to injury but respond to thrombin with a robust inflammatory response, thrombin is likely a key mediator of cerebrovascular activation in AD.
The release of vascular-derived inflammatory proteins could stimulate/activate neighboring glial cells, both microglia and astrocytes, to release inflammatory proteins as well as noxious ROS and proteases
This noxious, neurotoxic cycle could be augmented by vascular-derived thrombin.
In addition to thrombin's inflammatory effects on brain endothelia, thrombin could contribute to deleterious and self-perpetuating neuroinflammation via induction of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α in microglia and astrocytes
A recent study in the TgCRND8 AD mouse showed that long-term treatment with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran preserved cognition, cerebral perfusion, and BBB function, and ameliorated neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition
Administration of dabigatran to transgenic AD mice diminishes ROS levels in brain and reduces cerebrovascular expression of inflammatory proteins, further supporting an important role for thrombin as a mediator of neuroinflammation in the AD brain

INHIBITING THROMBIN: IMPLICATIONS FOR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN AD
Increasing evidence supports a chronic procoagulant state in AD, highlighting a possible pathogenic role for thrombin in this disease
A number of studies in both human populations and animal models utilizing anticoagulant therapies support the notion that abnormalities of coagulation may promote AD pathology.
Treatment of transgenic AD mice with enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin, reduces plaques, and Aβ accumulation
As previously stated, TgCRND8 AD mice on long-term dabigatran administration also showed significant improvement in AD pathology
Earlier human studies showed improved cognition in dementia patients receiving the anticoagulant warfarin compared to untreated patients
Results from these older studies in human patients hinted at a connection between dementia and coagulation abnormalities, but these data were not rigorously pursued.
A more recent community-based study found that use of the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of new-onset dementia
An epidemiological study on atrial fibrillation (AF) patients shows increased thrombin generation and fibrin turnover in subjects with AF and dementia compared to those without dementia, and that long-term warfarin treatment appears to be protective against dementia
The evidence supporting a direct connection between AF and dementia suggests the possibility that anticoagulant therapy for AF may reduce the incidence of dementia in this population, and results obtained in a number of recent population-based studies suggest that this is indeed the case
Interestingly, while some groups have found that all anticoagulants provide a level of protection
It is tempting to conclude that DOACs reduce the risk of AF-related dementia by decreasing the incidence of thrombotic and/or embolic events, but this scenario may be overly simplistic.
While there is clear evidence that AF is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke
It is probable that thrombin is a key mediator of this inflammatory state, as it is for the inflammation that accompanies AD dementia.
Furthermore, the utility of DOACs in the reduction of AF-related dementia is at least partially due to the ability of these agents to inhibit thrombin's PAR-mediated inflammatory actions.
It is therefore possible to interrupt the inflammatory cascade that contributes to AD by utilizing DOACs to inhibit thrombin.
There is as yet no direct evidence that this approach will be useful in humans, but an open-label study of a hirudin (natural antithrombin anticoagulant) compound in 84 patients with mild-to-moderate AD found that hirudin plus donepezil reduced the rate of cognitive decline compared to donepezil alone, suggesting that direct thrombin inhibition may indeed be an effective strategy for treating this neurodegenerative disease
Although the use of any anticoagulant raises the possibility of unwanted bleeding, several studies have shown the safety and efficacy of dabigatran.
Dabigatran does not interact with food, has minimal drug-drug interactions, and has a low risk of intracranial bleeding.
A study documented chronic use (over 30 months) of dabigatran in patients with an average age of 71.4 ± 8.6 had minimal side effects, supporting the efficacy and safety of this drug in an elderly population
Although not without caveats, a body of data implicating thrombin in AD pathogenesis and the relative safety of dabigatran suggest a pilot clinical trial in AD patients is warranted.

CONCLUSION
The urgent need for disease-modifying drugs in AD demands new thinking about disease pathogenesis and an exploration of novel drug targets.
A large, and growing, literature implicates vascular pathology and vascular risk factors in the development of AD, but the specific mechanisms whereby these factors contribute to injury in the AD brain have not yet been clearly defined.
It is time for "outside-the-box" thinking about how vascular risk factors, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, as well as the coagulation and inflammatory pathways interact to promote increased AD risk.
The evidence summarized here suggests that thrombin is a convergence point for AD risk factors and as such that thrombin-based therapeutics may therefore target multiple points of AD pathology, including neurodegeneration, vascular activation, and neuroinflammation.
Next generation AD therapeutics should not focus on singletarget drugs but rather employ a broader, combinatorial approach.
We propose that thrombin inhibitors be considered as potential contributors to the dementia therapy pharmacopeia.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The use of dabigatran and other DOACs as a novel strategy for the treatment of AD and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases where thrombin plays a role is warranted.
In addition, with the increasing interest/use of newer tools, such as microRNAs, other innovative therapeutic approaches that target thrombin could be employed.
MicroRNAs are short regulatory RNA molecules that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by affecting the translation and stability of mRNA targets
Evidence suggests that microRNAs are important regulators of neuronal survival, endothelial injury, and inflammatory signaling
Thrombin, which is at the nexus of all three of these processes, could mediate its effects, in part, via microRNAs.
The literature in this area is evolving but studies are beginning to identify thrombin-targeted microRNAs in the development of vascular injury and neuroinflammation (Table
There is increased recognition that effective therapies for AD must shift from the classical "one-size-fits-all" approach to a personalized precision medicine strategy
Inter-individual variability in response to pharmacotherapy as well as molecular/physiologic "subtypes" of patients within the broad category of AD support the rationale for a personalized therapeutic approach based on unique genetic characteristics and individual lifestyle attributes
There is growing interest in the use of pharmacogenomics to optimize the safety and efficacy of DOACs in anticoagulation therapy
As more data using this approach become available, incorporating DOACs into a personalized precision medicine approach for the treatment of AD could be accomplished in the near future.

FIGURE 1 | Thrombin-induced endothelial cell activation: a link between CVRFs and AD.
The Venn diagram illustrates a proposed role for thrombin-mediated endothelial cell (EC) injury as a common link between cardiovascular disease and AD.
Thrombin's proinflammatory effects on ECs in the periphery, characterized by increased reactive oxygen species, cytokines and chemokines, barrier permeability and leukocyte adhesion, contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
Similarly, thrombin may contribute to the development of AD by causing EC activation in the cerebral microcirculation.

A hypothetical scheme for thrombin as a mediator of cerebrovascular activation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.
Thrombin can cause neuronal injury directly and indirectly by activation of endothelial cells (ECs) and glia.
Thrombin can act on ECs of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to cause endothelial activation characterized by increased permeability and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and inflammatory proteins including thrombin.
These toxic vascular-derived products can injure neurons as well as activate neighboring glial cells to release noxious mediators which in turn cause neuronal injury.
