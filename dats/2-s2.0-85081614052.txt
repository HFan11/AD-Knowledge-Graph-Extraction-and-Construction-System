Plasma P-tau181 in Alzheimer's disease: relationship to other biomarkers, differential diagnosis, neuropathology and longitudinal progression to Alzheimer's dementia
Plasma phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) might be increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its usefulness for differential diagnosis and prognosis is unclear.
We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases.
Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages.
It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87-0.91 for different brain regions).
Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94-0.98),
and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort.
High plasma P-tau181 was associated with subsequent development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired and MCI subjects.
In conclusion, plasma P-tau181 is a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD, which may be useful in clinical practice and trials.

INTRODUCTION
Accumulation of misfolded β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in extracellular plaques and tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The diagnostic workup of AD has been revolutionized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers, which allow researchers, clinicians, and drug developers to identify AD in living humans with much greater precision than by clinical testing alone
The core CSF biomarkers include Aβ42 and tau (total
Reduced CSF Aβ42 and increased P-tau are believed to reflect Aβ and tau pathologies in AD, while increased T-tau is a more non-specific marker of neuronal injury
PET imaging can be used to directly visualize aggregates of both Aβ and tau in the brain.
However, both CSF measurements and PET imaging have significant hurdles.
They are invasive requiring a lumbar puncture (LP) or the injection of a radioactive ligand, are time-consuming for the clinician or cumbersome for the tested individual and LP may have side-effects (e.g.
post-spinal headache is the most common).
They are also relatively expensive, and the availability is limited especially in primary care.
There is therefore a great need for less invasive, cost-effective and easily accessible biomarkers, preferably blood tests.
Several assays have recently been developed to measure blood-based tau phosphorylated at threonine (Thr) 181 (P-tau181).
Studies using these assays found increased plasma levels of P-tau181 in patients with AD dementia or Down's syndrome compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals, and also found correlations between plasma P-tau181 and higher levels of Aβ PET and tau PET uptake
Together, these results are promising for the use of plasma P-tau181 as an AD biomarker, but several issues related to the performance of plasma P-tau181 are still unclear.
For example, it is not known if plasma P-tau181 is a useful biomarker to i) differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, ii) to predict future progression to AD dementia in non-demented people or iii) to identify individuals with pathological levels of Tau PET uptake.
It is also unclear how plasma levels of P-tau181 correlate with CSF P-tau181 levels, or how the diagnostic performance compares with other recently described plasma biomarkers in AD
We therefore designed a study to test the relationship between plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181, as well as PET imaging of tau and Aβ aggregates.
Further, we investigated whether plasma P-tau181 could differentiate between AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases and predict progression to AD dementia over time in non-demented individuals.
The predictive value of plasma P-tau181 was also compared to other relevant plasma biomarkers (i.e., T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and neurofilament light

METHODS
The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden, and all participants gave their informed consent to participate in the study.
Approval for PET imaging was obtained from the Swedish Medical Products Agency and the local Radiation Safety Committee at Skåne University Hospital.

Participants
This project was done as part of the Swedish BioFINDER study and included two separate cohorts recruited at Skåne University Hospital and the Hospital of Ängelholm, Sweden.
Cohort 1 included participants (n=182) enrolled between November 2014 and January 2018 who underwent [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET imaging, and cohort 2 included non-demented participants (n=344) enrolled between January 2010 and December 2014 who were followed longitudinally.
The demographics of each cohort are described in Table
The inclusion criteria for cognitively healthy elderly were 1) absence of cognitive symptoms as assessed by a physician with special interest in cognitive disorders, 2) age ≥60 years, 3) MMSE 28-30 points at screening visit, 4) did not fulfill the criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or any dementia disorder, and 5) fluency in Swedish.
The exclusion criteria were 1) significant unstable systemic illness or organ failure, such as terminal cancer, that made it difficult to participate in the study, 2) current significant alcohol or substance misuse and 3) significant neurological or psychiatric illness.
The inclusion criteria for patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or MCI (defined using criteria by
The exclusion criteria were 1) significant unstable systemic illness or organ failure, such as terminal cancer, that made it difficult to participate in the study, 2) current significant alcohol or substance misuse and 3) cognitive impairment that without doubt could be explained by other specific nonneurodegenerative disorders, such as brain tumor or subdural hematoma.
Following neuropsychological assessment including a test battery evaluating verbal ability, episodic memory function, visuospatial construction ability, and attention and executive functions, patients were classified as SCD or MCI as previously described
In accordance with the research framework by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association
In cohort 2, the study participants (i.e., participants who were cognitively unimpaired or had MCI at baseline) were followed over time with repeated cognitive, neurologic and psychiatric assessments by a physician, and also underwent repeated cognitive testing, MRI, and collection of CSF and blood.
The follow-up visits were performed every two years in the cognitively healthy group and every year for SCD and MCI patients (mean follow-up 4.9 years, SD=1.3 years).
In cohort 1, the study protocol was a priori designed to enroll cognitively unimpaired participants with a high prevalence (>50%) of Aβ positivity (Aβ+), and only Aβ+ MCI patients, because the focus was to study tau pathology in the pre-dementia stages of AD.
In cohort 1, we also included patients with AD dementia, who fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) due to AD.
All those were Aβ+
The non-AD neurodegenerative diseases group included patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (all fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria for the respective disease), Parkinson's disease (PD) (fulfilling the criteria defined by Gelb et al.

Plasma and CSF sampling and analysis
Blood and CSF samples were collected in the morning during the same visit with participants nonfasting.
For each study participant, blood was collected in 6 EDTA-plasma tubes (Vacutainer® K2EDTA tube, BD Diagnostics) and centrifuged (2000g, +4°C) for 10 min.
Following centrifugation, plasma from all 6 tubes was transferred into one 50ml polypropylene tubes tube, mixed and 1ml was aliquoted into 1.5ml polypropylene tubes and stored at -80°C within 30-60 min of collection.
Lumbar puncture and CSF handling followed a structured protocol
The laboratory technicians performing the biochemical analyses were blinded to the clinical data.
CSF from both cohorts was analyzed for Aβ42, Aβ40 and T-tau using ELISA (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) according to manufacturer's recommendations.
CSF P-tau181 was quantified using ELISA, as described in eMethods.
Plasma P-tau181 was analyzed in both cohorts as previously described
In short, the assay was performed on a streptavidin plate on the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform.
Biotinylated-AT270 was used as capture antibody (anti-pT181 Tau antibody; Thermo Fisher, catalog number: MN1050) and SULFO-TAG-LRL (anti-tau monoclonal antibodies developed by Lilly Research Laboratory) as detector.
Antibodies were conjugated with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, catalog number: 21327) or MSD GOLD SULFO-TAG NHS-Ester (MSD, catalog number: R91AO) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The assay was calibrated using a recombinant tau (4R2N, NCBI tau v2) protein that was phosphorylated in vitro.
In cohort 1, five (2.7%) samples from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases were below the level of detection (LOD, 0.54pg/ml).
In cohort 2, 15 (4.4%) samples were below the level of detection, including nine (2.6%) Aβ-cognitively unimpaired, four (1.2%) Aβ-MCI and two Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired (0.6%).
All plasma samples with P-tau181 concentrations below the LOD were included in statistical analysis using values extrapolated from the standard curve.
Outliers with plasma P-tau181 levels of more than 3 SD above the mean (n=7, 1.3% of all values) were excluded from statistical analysis.
In cohort 2, plasma Aβ42, Aβ40 and T-tau were measured using Elecsys fully-automated immunoassays on a cobas e 601 analyzer as described previously
Tau and Aβ PET imaging and processing [ 18 F]flortaucipir and [ 18 F]flutemetamol were synthesized at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, and PET scans were performed on a GE Discovery 690 PET scanner (Flortaucipir; General Electric Medical Systems, Chicago, IL) and a Philips Gemini TF 16 scanner (Flutemetamol; Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), respectively, as described previously
[ 18 F]flortaucipir PET was performed in cohort 1.
The mean injected dose of [ 18 F]flortaucipir was ≈370MBq, and participants underwent a PET scan 80-100 minutes after injection.
Images were motion corrected with the AFNI 3dvolreg, time averaged, and rigidly coregistered to the skullstripped MRI scan.
Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were created using inferior cerebellar gray matter as reference region
FreeSurfer (version 5.3) parcellation of the T1-weighted MRI scan was applied to the PET data transformed to participants' native T1 space to extract mean regional SUVR values for each participant in four predefined ROI including inferior temporal cortex and three regions corresponding to different image-based stages of tau as described in Cho et al.
For voxel-wise analysis between [ 18 F]flortaucipir and CSF and plasma P-tau181 the MR and PET images were transformed into Montreal Neurological Institute space (2mm MNI152 MRI template) and voxel-wise correlations were made using multiple regressions adjusting for age in SPM12 (
Images were thresholded using family-wise error (FWE) correction at p<0.01.
The thresholded images were overlaid on a Population-Average, Landmark-and Surface-based (PALS) image (Van Essen 2005) using CARET v5.65 (Van Essen Lab;
For some analyses, [ 18 F]flortaucipir data were binarized based on the SUVR cutoff of 1.3
[ 18 F]flutemetamol PET was done in both cohort 1 and cohort 2, and the mean injected dose was ≈185 MBq.
PET images were acquired between 90 and 110 minutes after injection.
The scanning and processing procedures have been described previously
The weighted mean standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from a global neocortical region of interest was calculated relative to a composite reference region (white matter, cerebellum and brainstem)

Aβ positivity
Cutoffs for CSF Aβ42 (<510pg/ml) and [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET SUVR (>0.743) were computed using Gaussian mixture modelling (ref
Study participants who underwent both lumbar puncture and Aβ PET imaging were considered Aβ positive if either CSF Aβ42 or Aβ PET measures were abnormal.

Statistical analysis
Differences in baseline characteristics were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.
Correlations between plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 and between plasma P-tau181 and [ 18 F]flortaucipir were examined with Spearman test.
Group differences in the biomarker levels were assessed using univariate general linear models (GLM) adjusting for age and sex as covariates and least significant difference (post hoc) tests for pairwise group comparisons.
Cutpoints were defined by Youden index (maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity).
Diagnostic accuracies of biomarkers were assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression models.
We used a bootstrap procedure (n=2000 bootstrap samples) to compare areas under two ROC curves and compute 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the sensitivities and specificities of the optimal thresholds.
To assess associations between plasma P-tau181 (used as a continuous variable or by tertiles) and risk of incident AD dementia we used Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusting for age, sex and years of education.
In a secondary analysis, we additionally included other potential plasma biomarkers of AD (i.e.
t-tau Aβ42/Aβ40 and NfL).
Log-transformed biomarker data were standardized within the sample and all study participants were censored at their last follow-up visit or diagnosis of AD dementia.
Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI.
The proportionality of hazards assumption was assessed using the Schoenfeld residuals.
Associations between log-transformed plasma P-tau181 and continuous Aβ PET uptake were tested with non-linear polynomial spline models (using I-spline basis), to detect Aβ PET thresholds for increased P-tau181 (defined as the Aβ level where the spline increased at least two standard errors from baseline).
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), a model selection tool, was used to compare models with the same outcome and individuals (a decrease in AIC <2 indicates a significantly better fit for the model with smaller AIC).
Log-transformed plasma P-tau181 values were used in all regression analyses.
Two-sided p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
All analyses were performed using SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, US) and R version 3.5.3
(including the packages pROC, survival, survminer and splines2).
Baseline characteristic of cohort 1 are provided in Table
Years of education and sex did not differ between the groups, while there were significant differences in age (F=3.6,
p=0.014),
MMSE (F=47.8,
p<0.001) and CSF AD biomarkers (Aβ42 F=18.3, p<0.001;
Ttau F=35.8, p<0.001;
P-tau181 F=52.3, p<0.001).
The mean age in the non-AD neurodegenerative diseases group was lower than in the cognitively unimpaired group (pairwise post hoc test: p=0.001).
MMSE scores were higher in the cognitively unimpaired group and lower in Aβ+ AD dementia patients compared with other groups (pairwise post hoc test: all p<0.001).

Cohort 1

Participants

Correlations between plasma and CSF P-tau181
In cohort 1, we found a strong positive correlation between plasma and CSF levels of P-tau181 (Rs=0.72,
p<0.001, n=172).
When stratifying by Aβ status, the correlation was significant in Aβ+ (Rs=0.68,
p<0.001, n=125) but not in Aβindividuals (Rs=0.11,
p=0.45, n=47) (Figure

Associations with [ 18 F]flortaucipir
[ 18 F]flortaucipir PET was performed in 174 study participants.
We first studied associations between plasma P-tau181 and [ 18 F]flortaucipir retention in commonly used a priori defined brain regions linked to tau pathology in AD, including the Braak I/IV ROI (temporal "meta-ROI") as well as the Braak I/II, III/IV, V/VI ROIs and inferior temporal cortex
Higher concentrations of P-tau181 were associated with increased [ 18 F]flortaucipir retention in the temporal meta-ROI (Braak I-IV ROI) in the whole cohort (Rs=0.64,
p<0.001) and in Aβ+ (Rs=0.69,
p<0.001) but not in Aβ-(Rs=0.12,
p=0.43) individuals (Figure
The results were similar for the other four ROIs (eFigure 1).
In the cognitively unimpaired group, plasma levels of P-tau181 were positively related to [ 18 F]flortaucipir retention in the earliest tau region (the Braak I/II ROI, Rs=0.29, p=0.02) but not in other regions, whereas in the cognitively impaired participants (Aβ+ MCI and Aβ+ AD dementia) the correlations were significant in all regions (Rsrange 0.49-0.60,
all p<0.001) except the early Braak I/II ROI (eTable 1).
Voxel-wise analyses revealed that plasma P-tau181 was mainly associated with [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET uptake in temporo-parietal regions (Fig1 C).
Next, we studied whether the plasma P-tau181 values varied between individuals at different stages of tau pathology as defined with [ 18 F]flortaucipir PET.
The cohort was divided into those with normal [ 18 F]flortaucipir retention in all Braak ROIs (Tau PET negative), and those with abnormal retention in either i) Braak I/II (but not III-VI), ii) Braak III/IV (but not V-VI) or iii) Braak V/VI.
We observed that P-tau181 concentrations differed between the Braak I/II+, III/IV+ and V/VI+ groups compared to those with normal [ 18 F]flortaucipir retention (F=43.5, p<0.001).
Plasma P-tau181 were increased in the Braak III/IV+ and V/VI+ compared with Tau PET-negative (pairwise post hoc test: both p<0.001; Figure
There was also a trend for higher P-tau181 levels in the Braak I/II+ group (pairwise post hoc test: p=0.056).
To establish whether plasma P-tau181 was associated with normal vs abnormal Tau PET scans we binarized [ 18 F]flortaucipir data.
In ROC curve analysis, P-tau181 accurately predicted abnormal Tau PET status in temporal meta-ROI (AUC 0.87 [95%CI 0.81%-0.92%],
sensitivity 80% [95%CI 70%-90%], specificity 78% [95%CI 70%-85%]; Figure

Plasma P-tau181 in AD and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases
P-tau181 concentrations varied between the diagnostic groups (F=36.0,
p<0.001; Figure
We found higher levels of P-tau181 in Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired, Aβ+ MCI and Aβ+ AD dementia than in Aβcognitively unimpaired (pairwise post hoc test: p=0.04, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases (pairwise post hoc test: all p≤0.001).
P-tau181 was also increased in Aβ+ MCI and Aβ+ AD dementia compared with Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired (pairwise post hoc test: both p<0.001).
Further, plasma P-tau181 accurately discriminated AD dementia (n=38) from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases (n=52) with AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.98).
When using the Youden index derived cutoff, the sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95%CI 82%-100%) and 87% (95%CI 77%-94%), respectively (eTable 3).
We next compared the diagnostic performance of plasma P-tau181 with CSF P-tau181 and [ 18 F]flortaucipir SUVR in the temporal meta-ROI (Braak I-IV) in a subcohort of 83 patients (35 AD dementia and 48 non-AD neurodegenerative disorders [10 PD, 16 PDD, 5 PSP, 5 DLB, 6 CBS, 2 SD and 4 bvFTD]) where all these measure were available.
The AUC, sensitivity and specificity were slightly lower for plasma P-tau181 (Figure
sensitivity 3%-6% and specificity 2%-6%) and not statistically significantly different from each other (p=0.28 for AUC plasma P-tau181 vs CSF P-tau181, and p=0.10 for AUC plasma P-tau181 vs [ 18 F]flortaucipir SUVR).

Cohort 2

Participants
Cohort 2 included 219 cognitively unimpaired participants and 125 MCI patients (Table
The prevalences of Aβ positivity were consistent with previously published data
Baseline characteristic of cohort 2 are provided in Table
Age (F=5.9, p=0.001), sex (χ 2 =16.1, p=0.001), years of education (F=3.7,
p=0.012),
MMSE (F=31.6,
p<0.001) and CSF AD biomarkers (Aβ42 F=186.4,
p<0.001;
T-tau F=27.7, p<0.001;
P-tau181 F=46.6, p<0.001) differed by diagnostic group.
The Aβ-MCI group was younger than all the other groups (pairwise post hoc test: all p<0.002).
There were more men in the Aβ-MCI group compared with the Aβ-cognitively unimpaired and Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired groups (both p=0.01) and in the Aβ+ MCI patients compared with the Aβcognitively unimpaired group (p<0.001).
Education was on average one year shorter in the Aβ-MCI and Aβ+ MCI groups compared with the cognitively unimpaired and Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired groups (pairwise post hoc test: all p=0.02).
MMSE scores were lower in the MCI groups than in the cognitively unimpaired groups (pairwise post hoc test: all p<0.001) and in Aβ-MCI compared with Aβ+ MCI (pairwise post hoc test: p=0.023).
Similar to cohort 1, we found significant positive correlation between plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 (Rs=0.48,
p<0.001, n=343) and also that the correlations were significant in Aβ+ (Rs=0.55,
p<0.001, n=173) but not in Aβ-(Rs=0.11,
p=0.15, n=170) individuals (eFigure 2).

Plasma P-tau181 in diagnostic groups
P-tau181 levels varied between different diagnostic groups (F=39.5, p<0.001; Figure
We found higher concentrations of P-tau181 in Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired and Aβ+ MCI patients compared with Aβcognitively unimpaired and Aβ-MCI patients and also in Aβ+ MCI patients compared with Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired (pairwise post hoc test: all p≤0.001; Figure

Plasma P-tau181 vs [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET
[ 18 F]flutemetamol PET was performed in 318 study participants.
Increased levels of P-tau181 correlated with increased [ 18 F]flutemetamol SUVR in the whole cohort (Rs=0.44,
p<0.001) and in Aβ+ individuals (Rs=0.43,
p<0.001, n=161).
The correlation coefficients were higher for plasma P-tau181 than plasma Aβ42 and comparable for P-tau181 and plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 (eTable 4).
P-tau181 accurately differentiated individuals with normal versus pathological [ 18 F]flutemetamol status when including all study participants (AUC 0.81 [95%CI 0.76%-0.86%],
and when used combined with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (AUC=0.84,
95%CI=0.80-0.89).
The results were similar in cognitively unimpaired participants and MCI patients (eTable 5).
Using non-linear spline models with continuous [ 18 F]flutemetamol load as predictor of plasma P-tau181, we determined the Aβ thresholds for when P-tau181 levels increased (Figure
Plasma P-tau181 increased significantly at [ 18 F]flutemetamol 0.70 SUVR.
This was slightly after similar thresholds for CSF P-tau181 (SUVR 0.63) and close to a threshold for [ 18 F]flutemetamol positivity (SUVR 0.743 ref: Mattsson, Leuzy, under review).
These results show that increases in plasma P-tau181 start early in AD, just before the time of Aβ positivity, and they were replicated in cohort 1 (eFigure 1).

Plasma P-tau181 and progression to AD dementia
Among 344 participants in cohort 2, 332 underwent follow-up clinical examinations.
Over a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years (SD=1.3
years), 62 (18.7%) individuals developed AD dementia and 33 (9.9%) other neurodegenerative disorders
Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for age, sex and education showed that each 1 SD increment in the log of plasma P-tau181 was associated with 280% greater risk of AD dementia (HR=3.8,
95%CI=2.8-5.2, p<0.001).
Compared to the lowest tertile, both the highest and the middle tertiles of plasma P-tau181 were associated with increased risk of incident AD dementia (HR=27.2,
95%CI=6.
respectively; Figure
We found similar associations between plasma P-tau181 (continuous) and increased risk of dementia (HR=3.6,
95%CI=2.6-5.0,
p<0.001, n=325) after additional adjustment for plasma T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and NfL.
Furthermore, none of the latter biomarkers were independently related to the risk of AD dementia in the multivariate analyses including all plasma biomarkers (T-tau HR=0.98, 95%CI=0.73-1.32;
Aβ42/Aβ40 HR=0.81, 95%CI=0.64-1.0;
NfL HR=1.1, 95%CI=0.79-1.44).
In a secondary analysis stratified by baseline diagnosis, plasma P-tau181 was associated with increased risk of AD dementia in the cognitively unimpaired participants (HR=2.5, 95%CI=1.2-5.1, p=0.01) and MCI patients (HR=3.1,
95%CI=2.1-4.4,
p<0.001), and after additional adjustment for plasma T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and NfL (cognitively unimpaired HR=2.4,
95%CI=1.0-5.5, p=0.04;
MCI HR=3.0, 95%CI=2.0-4.5, p<0.001).

DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study were that plasma P-tau181 1) correlated to CSF P-tau181, 2) identified increased Tau PET ligand uptake, 3) increased along the AD continuum, from Aβcognitively unimpaired participants, Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired,
Taken together, these results show that plasma P-tau181 is related to several key aspects of AD pathophysiology and support the use of plasma P-tau181 for screening, clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and prognosis with a precision previously only seen in CSF and PET biomarkers.
Notably, plasma P-tau181 concentration showed larger fold change and less overlap between Aβ-positive andnegative subject than plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (refs: Ovod + Nakamura + Janelidze), and could thus potentially serve as an Aβ pathology "sensor" in the blood.
The correlations with CSF P-tau181 found in both cohorts resemble the association between plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 in a much smaller study by
A novel finding in our study was that plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 only correlated in Aβ+ individuals.
This was likely due to greater dynamic ranges of both plasma and CSF P-tau181 in Aβ positive subjects, making it easier to detect significant correlations.
It is possible that CSF and blood P-tau181 are differently regulated with different pathophysiological secretion depending on Aβ status.
Supporting this, plasma P-tau181 had greater variability than CSF P-tau181 in Aβindividuals, and some individuals had considerable increases in plasma P-tau181 without increases in CSF P-tau181 (Figure
Other studies have shown much weaker correlations between plasma T-tau and CSF T-tau levels than the correlations described here for P-tau181
Therefore, the stronger correlations between plasma and CSF levels of P-tau181 compared to total-tau likely reflects that under normal conditions, and in chronic neurodegenerative disorders, P-tau181 is more brain-specific (and more specific for AD), while T-tau can potentially also be produced outside the central nervous system
The present findings indicate that plasma P-tau181 is superior to previously published results for plasma T-tau, both for diagnostic purposes and to detect pathological brain changes in AD
Importantly, we found that plasma P-tau181, but not T-tau, was independently associated with increased risk of progression to AD dementia.
(eTable 4).
The correlations between P-tau181 and Tau PET indicate that the increase in plasma P-tau181 is related to the build-up of tau deposits in AD, since Tau PET is closely correlated to brain tau deposits
Plasma P-tau181 correlated to Tau PET in all tested regions in the overall cohort 1, and to all regions except the Braak I/II region (entorhinal cortex) in Aβ+ cognitively impaired individuals.
A few factors may explain the lack of correlation with Tau PET in the entorhinal cortex in cognitively impaired individuals.
Entorhinal cortex is one of the earliest sites engaged by tau pathology in AD and one of the first sites with increased Tau PET signal
In contrast, the only correlations to Tau PET in cognitively unimpaired individuals were seen in the entorhinal cortex, supporting the use of plasma P-tau181 as a very sensitive test for tau pathology.
Notably, the only previous study correlating plasma P-tau181 with Tau PET in entorhinal cortex similarly did not find correlations in Aβ+ AD dementia, but only in Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired and MCI, in line with our findings
Besides correlating to continuous regional Tau PET, plasma P-tau181 also identified individuals with abnormal Tau PET ligand retention in the Braak composites (AUC 0.81-0.91).
Plasma P-tau181 may therefore be useful as a non-invasive biomarker to predict a positive Tau PET scan, for example as a screening tool for enrichment in clinical trials aiming to enroll tau positive subjects.
We also applied a staging system, where individuals were grouped based on regional Tau PET signals, into Tau PET-, Braak I/II+, III/IV+ and V/VI+ stages.
Using this system, plasma P-tau181 levels increased numerically stepwise between the stages.
There were no significant differences between the positive stages, which may partly be a power issue, since the positive groups were rather small (N=12 to 33).
Future studies may characterize how plasma P-tau181, together with other measures, can be fine-tuned to predict different classes of Tau PET positivity.
Tau PET is strongly correlated to level of cognitive impairment in AD
Given the correlations between plasma P-tau181 and Tau PET, the findings in our cohorts of stepwise increases in plasma P-tau181 from Aβcognitively unimpaired to Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired and further to Aβ+ MCI (Figures
The lack of significant difference between Aβ+ MCI and AD dementia indicates that plasma P-tau181 eventually reaches a plateau.
These results are largely similar to data from previous studies by
This is similar to what has been described previously for CSF P-tau181
Differential diagnosis of AD dementia from other diseases is difficult on clinical grounds, as reflected by the modest correlation between clinical AD diagnosis and neuropathological confirmation of the disease
Tau PET has excellent performance to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, since abnormal increase in Tau PET is very rare in most other dementias
We show that plasma P-tau181 has very similar performance (AUC 0.95) as Tau PET (AUC 0.98) when differentiating AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, indicating that plasma P-tau181 has a potential as an alternative to Tau PET for differential diagnosis between AD (at the dementia stage) and other neurodegenerative diseases.
The prediction of future longitudinal impairment and dementia is a key question for clinical management of individuals with mild cognitive deficits, and for design of clinical trials in nondemented stages of AD.
It is well known that CSF biomarkers, including P-tau181, are altered several years prior to dementia, and predict future conversion to AD dementia
In the present study, we show that P-tau181 accurately predicts conversion to AD dementia in non-demented people.
In models combining plasma P-tau181 and other potential plasma AD biomarkers, including T-tau
These findings indicate that plasma P-tau181 could be used in clinical practice in primary care to identify individuals who would benefit from symptomatic treatment and in clinical trials to risk stratify asymptomatic participants and patients with MCI.
The finding that plasma P-tau181 correlated to Aβ measured by [ 18 F]flutemetamol points to a link between metabolism of plasma P-tau181 and Aβ build-up in the brain.
The overall AUC to differentiate Aβ-and Aβ+ individuals was 0.81, which increased to 0.84 when combined with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40.
Our spline model analysis suggested that plasma P-tau181 started to increase around the time of Aβ positivity, but levels of plasma P-tau181 appeared to continue to increase as Aβ accumulated (although our analysis was cross-sectional), as shown by the correlations with [ 18 F]flutemetamol even within the Aβ+ subgroup.
This study confirms some aspects of plasma P-tau181 described previously, but also adds completely new evidence, including that plasma P-tau181 correlates to significant Tau PET uptake in several different meta-ROIs (corresponding to Braak tau stages), can be used for differential diagnosis of AD versus non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, and accurately predicts conversion to AD dementia in non-demented individuals with a higher accuracy than previously suggested plasma AD biomarkers including T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and NfL.

Limitations
The study has several limitations.
First, the non-AD neurodegenerative diseases group was relatively small and predominantly included patients with PD and PDD.
Thus, our findings need to be replicated in larger and clinically more relevant patient groups, preferably also in a primary care setting.
Second, even if Tau PET correlates closely with tau pathology in the brain
Finally, plasma P-tau181 was measured using a research-grade assay and a fully validated clinical-grade assay together with a certified reference material (CRM), see
To conclude, plasma P-tau181 is a promising biomarker for diagnosis of AD and prognostication of clinical progression, and in drug trials to enrich eligible participants and potentially also to monitor biological effects of treatments.
The NIA-AA research framework on AD
Given the obvious benefit of being a blood test, together with the close correlations to CSF P-tau181, Tau PET load, AD diagnosis, and longitudinal conversion to AD, we suggest that plasma P-tau181 can be used to identify tau status in future classification systems.
In the Box-and-Whisker plot, the box ranges from the first to the third quartile, the vertical line represents the median of the diagnostic group and the whiskers indicate the range from the minimum to quartile 1 and from quartile 3 to the maximum excluding outliers.
Outliers were defined as P-tau181 values less than quartile 1 or greater than quartile 3 by more than 1.5 times the interquartile range, and are shown as separate plotted points.
The dotted line represents the median P-tau181 concentration in the Aβ-cognitively unimpaired group.
P-values are from univariate general linear models adjusting for age and sex as described in the methods.
