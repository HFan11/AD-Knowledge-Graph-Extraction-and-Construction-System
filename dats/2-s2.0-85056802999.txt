Amyloid�β and tau are involved in sleep disorder in Alzheimer's disease by orexin�A and adenosine A(1) receptor
Sleep disorder is confirmed as a core component of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in brain tissue is an important pathological feature of AD.
However, how Aβ affects AD-associated sleep disorder is not yet well understood.
In the present study, experiments on animal and cell models were performed to detect the association between sleep disorder and Aβ.
It was observed that Aβ25-35 administration significantly decreased non-rapid eye movement sleep, while it increased wakefulness in mice.
In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of tau, p-tau, orexin A and orexin neurons express adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) were markedly upregulated in the brain tissue of AD mice compared with that in samples obtained from control mice.
Furthermore, the in vitro study revealed that the expression levels of tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R were also significantly increased in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ25-35 as compared with the control cells.
In addition, the tau inhibitor TRx 0237 significantly reversed the promoting effects of Aβ25-35 on tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R expression levels, and adenosine A1R or orexin A knockdown also inhibited tau and p-tau expression levels mediated by Aβ25-35 in AD.
These results indicate that Aβ and tau may be considered as novel biomarkers of sleep disorder in AD pathology, and that they function by regulating the expression levels of orexin A and adenosine A1R.

Introduction
As a neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 50-70% of all dementia cases.
With the aging of the population, it is expected that the worldwide prevalence of AD will quadruple by 2050 as compared with the reported rate of 26.6 million cases in 2006, and ~43% of AD patients require a high level of care
The main symptoms of AD patients include cognitive decline, accompanied by psychological and behavioral abnormalities, decline in the ability to perform daily activities, depression and sleep disorder.
As one of the common symptoms, sleep disorder severely affects the quality of life of patients
AD-associated sleep disorder is increasingly prominent, and studies on mechanism of AD-associated sleep disorder and new therapies are of great value.
However, the molecular mechanism of AD-associated sleep disorder remain unclear.
Furthermore, it has recently been reported that sleep disorder may accelerate the AD neurodegeneration and cognitive decline
A previous study has suggested that insufficient sleep facilitates the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ), which has been confirmed as one of the main pathological characteristics of AD
Neurofibrillary tangles composed of an excessive amount of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein have been confirmed as the second pathology of AD.
Therefore, Aβ and abnormal tau protein have a central role in the neuropathology of AD
A previous study has also confirmed that a long tau was associated with the delayed sleep phase disorder, which may be the reflection of an abnormal circadian timing system
The interplay and synergy between Aβ and tau induce sleep disorder and accelerate the pathogenesis of AD
Sleep is produced when the internal inhibition process spreads to the cerebral cortex and subcortical structure.
Sleep serves an essential role in the regulation of synaptic weight in the brain; for instance, it reduces the slow wave activity of the brain caused by the accumulation of synaptic enhancement in wakefulness
The neuropeptides orexin A (also known as hypocretin-1) and orexin neurons express A1 adenosine receptor (A1R) secreted from lateral hypothalamus (LH) neurons are known to be critical modulators of the sleep/wakefulness system
In addition, it has been reported that orexinergic system disorder may alter the sleep-wake rhythms and influence AD pathology
It has also been reported that blockade of adenosine A1R in the orexinergic LH induced a significant increase in wakefulness; however, adenosine A1R antagonists are able to reverse this effect and may serve as potential preventive or therapeutic strategies in AD patients
Activation of adenosine A1R can accelerate sleep, whereas adenosine A1R blockade can promote awakening and compensatory sleep
A previous study has also reported that orexin A, which may increase arousal levels, promoted Aβ production and was associated with the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle.
Furthermore, recent studies have focused on the associations of orexin A with p-tau
However, whether the changes in Aβ and p-tau levels are associated with orexin A secretion in the sleep-wake cycle remains unknown.
Based on this preliminary evidence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the regulatory effect of Aβ and p-tau on sleep disorder in AD patients.

Materials and methods
Establishment of an AD animal model.
Experiments were performed on male 5xFAD mice (15-25 g), which overexpressed human APP and PS1 with 5 familial AD mutations.
50 mice (1-year-old) were purchased from Kay Biological Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) All the mice were free access to food and water and were kept in an undisturbed and clean environment with 12 h/12 h dark-light cycle, 90% relative humidity and 25˚C.
The animals were acclimatized to the laboratory environment for 1 week before the experiments.
The AD mouse model was constructed as previously described in which 1-year old 5xFAD mice spontaneously exhibit AD-like pathological changes
ym-Y-0044, Yuanmu, China) 3 weeks prior to tests.
Mice anesthetized with 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate (i.p.)
Before use, Aβ 25-35 was diluted in sterile saline to a concentration of 0.5 mM and was maintained at 37˚C for 7 days to pre-age the peptide
A water maze experiment was used to detect the behavioral changes of the mice.
All animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines of Shandong University (Jinan, China), and experiments were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Shandong University.
Morris water maze.
The Morris water maze test was conducted in a circular pool with a diameter of 120 cm, a height of 50 cm and a depth of 30 cm.
The pool was divided into 4 quadrants, and a platform with a diameter of 10 cm and height of 28 cm was placed in the middle of one of the quadrants.
The back of the head of the mouse was marked with picric acid for tracking.
A marker that hung over the wall of the pool and a number of constant reference objects around the pool were used as visual cues.
The water temperature was maintained at 25˚C, and the hidden platform experiment was conducted 4 times per day for 5 successive days.
Mice were dropped from 4 different locations and the escape latency time spent to find the hidden platform was monitored by a video tracking system.
If the mouse did not find the hidden platform within 2 min, the researcher guided the mouse to the platform and permitted to stay on the platform for 10 sec, after which the mouse was returned to the cage, and the incubation period was recorded as 2 min.
The experiment consisted of two parts, in part 1, the mice were dropped into the 4 different quadrants, termed west (w), east (e), north (n) and south (s) respectively, each day for 5 days in the following order: Day 1, w-s-e-n; day 2, s-e-n-w; day 3: e-n-w-s; day 4, n-w-s-e; and day 5, w-s-e-n.
In part 2, on day 6, the hidden platform was removed and the mice were put into the water from a quadrant that did not contain the platform.
The number of times that the mice crossed the original location of the platform within 2 min was recorded.
During part 1 and part 2, the total distance that the mice swam, and the time the mice spent in the platform quadrant were recorded.
Sleep analysis.
The sleep disturbances and sleep-wake state of AD mice were recorded and analyzed with polysomnography, in which electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) results were recorded and used to analyzed the non-rapid eye-movement sleep and rapid eye-movement sleep.
In order to obtain the EEG and EMG scan, EEG and EMG electrodes were implanted into the skull simultaneously (NeuroLogger, TSE Systems GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany).
For EEG recording, two stainless steel screws attached to wire electrodes were placed over the right frontal and parietal bones.
For EMG recording, two wire electrodes were directly inserted into the neck musculature.
During the study, age matched mice were used as a control.
Briefly, after 2 days of habituation to the device, 5xFAD mice and age matched controls underwent EEG recordings, which commenced on day 3. Body movements, and brain EEG activity was recorded and stored at 200 samples per second with a high-pass filter of 0.25 Hz and low-pass filter of 70 Hz.
Digitized data were downloaded offline to a computer.
EEG and EMG signals were recorded in a computer and then assessed with sleep-scoring software (SIRENIA ® SEIZURE PRO).

Results

Decreased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increased wakefulness in AD mice.
The sleep patterns in the control and AD groups were compared, and as mice are nocturnal animals, the sleep cycle was from 8 am to 8 pm.
The results indicated that the NREM sleep in AD mice was significantly decreased compared with that in the control group (P<0.05,
P<0.01 and P<0.001; Fig.
The results also demonstrated that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in AD mice was similar to the normal amount observed in control animals at other time points, except for at 16:00 (P<0.05) (Fig.
The wakefulness in AD mice at 8:00 was markedly increased compared with that of the control group (P<0.001),
however, it was equal to the normal amount of wakefulness observed in control animals at other hourly time points (Fig.
Behavioral changes in AD model mice.
The Morris water maze test was applied to confirm the behavioral changes of AD mice.
The tracing of the movement of mice during the hidden platform test and the probe trial test for the control and AD model mice are presented in Fig.
Fig.
Therefore, it is suggested that the AD model was successfully established in the mice.
In addition, the results indicated that the number of platform-crossings for the AD model mice was significantly lower compared with that of the control mice (P<0.05;
Fig.
It is, thus, suggested that the learning ability of AD model mice was worse in comparison with that of control group mice.

Upregulation of tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R in
the brain tissue of 5xFAD mice.
RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were conducted to validate the expression levels of different genes in the control and AD mice.
The RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the relative expression levels of tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R were markedly upregulated in AD mice compared with the control mice (P<0.01,
P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively; Fig.
The western blot results were consistent with the RT-qPCR results (Fig.
The tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R expression levels were higher in AD mice compared with those in control mice (P<0.05;
Fig.

RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were also used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively, in SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ25-35.
As shown in Fig.
Changes in mRNA and protein expression levels following treatment with Aβ25-35, or a combination of Aβ25-35 and TRx 0237.
There was a significant increase in the mRNA relative expression levels of adenosine A1R and orexin A following Aβ25-35 treatment; however, the high expression levels of adenosine A1R and orexin A were significantly reduced following Aβ25-35 and TRx 0237 co-treatment (P<0.05;
Fig.
Next, the protein expression levels of tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R were determined by western blot analysis.
Overexpression of tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R was observed in the Aβ25-35-treated group compared with the control group.
However, TRx 0237 co-treatment significantly reversed the promoting effects of Aβ25-35 on tau, p-tau, orexin A and adenosine A1R expression (Fig.

As shown in Fig.

Discussion
AD is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease that affects the cognitive functions of the elderly
Currently, no therapies are available to halt or reverse the progression of this disease.
In the present study, it was observed that NREM sleep was decreased and wakefulness was increased in AD mice.
In the Morris water maze assay, a shorter escape latency time indicates better memory, and increased number of platform crossings indicates better learning ability
The present study in 5xFAD mice revealed a longer escape latency and lower number of platform crossings compared with control group, which indicated a deteriorated memory and learning ability in 5xFAD mice.
Aβ serves a pivotal and potentially causative role in the pathogenesis of AD, and has thus become a major therapeutic target
At present, studies have confirmed that AD neurodegeneration started with the aggregation of non-soluble monomeric Aβ peptides, and that the deposition of Aβ in plaques is the main driver of AD pathogenesis.
Epidemiological studies have reported that patients with AD suffered from sleep dysfunction
Sleep disorder has been confirmed to decrease clearance of Aβ in the brain and accelerate AD pathology.
In the present study, the interaction between sleep disorder and AD was further explored.
In recent years, it has been documented that the aggregation of Aβ can induce abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and lead to nerve fiber formation
In addition, a higher level of tau protein has been confirmed as a marker of rapid cognitive decline, while the abundance of neurofibrillary  tangles was correlated with the severity of dementia
Previous studies
In addition, in a study performed by Kang et al
In the present study, the 5xFAD mice AD model was used, and the data indicated a significantly decreased NREM sleep and increased wakefulness in the mice.
The orexinergic system is a key regulator of sleep onset.
The neuropeptide orexin A (also known as hypocretin-1) produced by LH neurons has a significant impact on sleep-wake cycle regulation
It has been suggested that orexin regulated both the diurnal wake and nocturnal sleep periods through reducing REM sleep and slow-wave sleep, and increasing wakefulness
Additionally, adenosine inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission of orexin neurons via the receptor adenosine A1R.
Blockade of adenosine A1R in the orexinergic LH induced a significant increase in wakefulness, while it decreased sleep in the sleep-wake cycle
Consequently, it can be predicted that the sleep disorder may be associated with the abnormal regulation of Aβ and tau on the adenosine A1R axis.
In the present study, the expression levels of orexin A and adenosine A1R were found to be markedly upregulated in the brain tissue of AD mice, and similar results were observed in SH-SY5Y cells treated with Aβ25-35.
In addition, treatment with the tau inhibitor TRx 0237 not only decreased the tau and p-tau expression levels, but also reversed the promoting effects of Aβ25-35 on orexin A and adenosine A1R expression levels.
Adenosine A1R or orexin knockdown also inhibited tau and p-tau expression mediated by Aβ25-35 in the AD cell model.
In fact, a previous publication indicated that increased orexin A promoted wakefulness and sleep fragmentation, consequently promoting p-tau accumulation
In the current study, it was confirmed that orexin A expression was positively correlated with the wakefulness time and tau expression induced by Aβ accumulation, which provides further evidence on the regulatory network of sleep disorder in AD pathology.
In conclusion, the present study highlighted that sleep disorder in 5xFAD mice with AD-like neurocognitive changes is positively associated with the accumulation of Aβ and tau, which induced the overactivation of the orexinergic system.
Therefore, these findings suggest that Aβ and tau can be considered as novel biomarkers of sleep disorder in AD pathology.
Furthermore, Aβ and tau appear to serve key roles in sleep regulation by regulating the expression levels of orexin A and adenosine A1R.
However, further studies are required to validate how silencing A1R and orexin by siRNA transfection affects the sleep-wake cycle changes.
It is also necessary to investigate the deeper mechanisms underlying the actions of adenosine A1R and orexin in sleep disorder in AD.
