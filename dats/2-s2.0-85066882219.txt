Serum miRNAs Expression and SNAP-25 Genotype in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by binding their 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) region; these molecules play a fundamental role in several pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is a vesicular protein of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) involved in neural plasticity and in the exocytosis of neurotransmitters, processes that are altered in AD.
Recent results showed that a reduction of SNAP-25 is associated with dementia, and that the rs363050 SNAP-25 polymorphism correlates with cognitive decline and brain atrophy, as well as with the outcome of multistructured rehabilitation in AD patients.
We verified the presence of possible correlations between the serum concentration of miRNAs that bind the SNAP-25 3 UTR region and AD.
Six different microRNAs (miR-181a-5p, miR-361-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-15b-3p, 130a-3p and miR-27b-3p) that bind the SNAP-25 3 UTR region were measured by qPCR in serum of AD patients (n = 22), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects (n = 22) and age-and sex-matched controls (n = 22); analysis of results was done stratified for the rs363050 SNAP-25 genotype.
Results showed that miR-27b-3p, miR-23a-3p and miR181a-5p serum concentration was significantly reduced in rs363050 SNAP-25 GG homozygous AD patients.
Notably, concentration of these miRNAs was comparable in rs363050 AA homozygous AD patients, MCI and healthy controls (HCs).
Data herein suggest that miRNAs that bind the SNAP-25 3 UTR region interact with SNAP-25 polymorphisms to influence the neural plasticity typical of AD brains, possibly as a consequence of modulatory activity on SNAP-25 mRNA and/or protein.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related form of dementia
The etiopathogenesis of the disease is still unknown, and AD is defined as a multifactorial pathology whose development and progression is the result of the combination of several factors
People with a cognitive decline which is more severe than expected, but without the pathological failure typical of AD, are diagnosed as being affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI;
Recent results suggested the involvment of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), a component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor
Thus, it was shown that: (1) SNAP-25 protein expression is reduced in brains
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs (containing about 20-24 nucleotides) involved in mRNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression
miRNAs are thus key players in the normal function of cells, and impairments in their modulation, regulation and/or expression are associated with pathologies including tumors
A possible role for miRNAs alterations has been postulated in AD
In the present pilot study, we verified whether serum concentration of the miRNAs that bind the 3 UTR region of SNAP-25 differs when AD, MCI and healthy controls (HCs) individuals are compared and, if this was the case, whether the expression of these miRNAs is modulated by the SNAP-25 rs363050 polymorphism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients and Controls
The Discovery Cohort was formed by 12 elderly HCs who had already been genotyped for rs363050 SNAP-25
For the Study Cohort 22 patients affected by AD and 22 individuals with a diagnosis of MCI were recruited by the Department of Neurorehabilitation of IRCCS Santa Maria Nascente, Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation-ONLUS, Milan, Italy.
Patients were diagnosed either with AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA Work Group criteria
To exclude reversible cases of dementia, all patients underwent complete medical and neurological examination, laboratory analyses, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan.
Twenty-two HCs matched with patients for gender and age were also enrolled in the study.
All these 66 subjects (22 AD, 22 MCI and 22 HCs) had already been genotypized for rs363050 SNAP-25
No other complications, including malnutrition, vitamin deficiency syndromes or tumor pathologies, were present in any of the individuals enrolled in the study.
Blood count, urine analysis, blood chemistry screen, serum folate, B12 levels, and thyroid function tests were normal in all the subjects.
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of ethics committee of the Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi with written informed consent from all subjects, or their relatives when appropriate.
All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi.

RESULTS

Serum miRNAs Profiling: Discovery Cohort
Expression profile of 90 miRNAs targeting and putatively binding 3 UTR of SNAP-25 that were selected by in silico analysis and are known to be expressed in serum was performed in all the individuals part of the Discovery Cohort (12 HCs; six rs363050 AA genotype vs. six rs363050 GG genotype).
Fifty-seven of the 90 miRNAs were detected in serum.
Serum relative concentration of six miRNAs was identified as being differentially modulated by the SNAP-25 rs363050 genotype, as their expression ratio was >2.5-fold or <-2.5-fold in both software used (qbase and Qiagen Software): miR-181a-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-15b-3p, miR27b-3p, miR-361-5p and miR-23a-3p; all these miRNAs were up regulated in GG genotype compared to AA genotype HC.

Serum miRNAs Expression Validation: Study Cohort
Results were subsequently validated with single qPCR in a larger population (Study Cohort) that included AD, MCI and HC individuals (Table
miR-23a-3p was detected in all individuals whereas miR-15b-3p was observed only in few cases (AD: 14%; MCI: 32%; HCs: 18%).
miR-181a-5p, was statistically more frequent in MCI (95%) compared to AD patients (65%; p = 0.02), whereas HCs had an intermediate frequency (77%).
Frequency and fold expression of each miRNA is summarized in Table
GG homozygous rs363050 genotype AD patients (ADGG) were characterized by a lower expression of miR-27b-3p, miR-23a-3p and miR181a-5p compared to HCs, regardless of the rs363050 genotypes, as well as to all other groups.
In particular, ADGG were characterized by a significantly lower miR-27b-3p expression (0.23; 0.08-0.71),
compared to in AA homozygous AD (ADAA; 2.23; 0.79-3.84;
p = 0.02) and MCI individuals (MCIAA; 1.63; 0.89-2.89;
p = 0.03; Figure
Moreover, miR-23a-3p expression reduced as well in ADGG (0.27; 0.05-0.29)
compared to all the other groups; this reduction reached statistical significance in comparison with AA homozygous HCs (HCAA; 0.97; 0.56-2.23;
p = 0.02), ADAA (1.03; 0.30-3.65;
p = 0.05), MCIAA (1.04; 0.39-1.42;
p = 0.03), and GG homozygous MCI individuals (MCIGG; 2.14; 0.38-1.01;
p = 0.03; Figure
Finally, miR-181a-5p expression was lower in ADGG (0.17; 0.02-1.56)
compared to all the other groups (vs.
ADAA: 2.33; 1.27-2.87;
p = 0.05; Figure
Overall results of miRNAs expression considering the rs363050 genotype are summarized in Supplementary Table
No differences were found in relation with sex, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or mini mental state evaluation (MMSE) score.

DISCUSSION
AD is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the rate of decline and functional restoration depend on the capacity for neural plasticity within residual neural tissues
In particular, the rs363050 SNP of SNAP-25 was shown to correlate with brain activity
By binding the 3 UTR region of genes, miRNAs inhibit the translation of mRNA into proteins, thus modulating gene expression
All the miRNAs analyzed in the present work putatively target and modulate SNAP-25 expression, although miR-27a/b alone has so far been shown to inhibit the activity of SNAP-25
Herein, we describe that the serum expression of miR-27b-3p, miR-23a-3p and miR-181a-5p is significantly reduced in AD patients that are homozygous for the G allele in the rs363050 SNP of SNAP-25.
Although it is expressed in an intronic region, rs363050 was shown to modulate the expression of SNAP-25 protein; GG homozygosity, in particular, results in a reduced production of the protein compared to the AA homozygosis
Importantly, three independent studies detected a very low expression of SNAP-25 protein in the brain of AD patients compared to those of elderly not-AD individuals
Interestingly, miRNAs miR-27b-3p, miR-23a-3p and miR-181a-5p were also recently shown to be deregulated in serum of patients that underwent ischemic stroke
Based on these results it is tempting to speculate that in rs363050 GG homozygous AD patients, in whom SNAP-25 protein expression is reduced because of their genetic background, lower amounts of miRNAs that down regulate SNAP-25 expression would be an attempt to bypass such reduced SNAP-25 levels.
In MCI individuals this phenomenon is not present possibly because modulation of miRNA expression only characterizes the later phases of dementia.
It is important to note that, as SNAP-25 is more expressed in excitatory neurons than in inhibitory neurons
It is nevertheless important to underline that we analyzed miRNAs expression in serum alone; these data might not reflect what goes on intracellularly, where miRNA-mRNA interactions, and the consequent modulation of gene expression take place.
For these reasons our results need to be validated in a larger cohort, including also rs363050 heterozygous subjects, in which intracellular miRNA expression will need to be investigated.
Finally, further experiment based on luciferase assay will be necessary to confirm the interaction between the miRNAs and SNAP-25 3 UTR region and the effects of such interaction on SNAP-25 expression.
In conclusion, results of this pilot study, although preliminary and requiring to be confirmed by other independent studies with larger cohorts, suggest that the interaction between genetic and epigenetic factors modulate SNAP-25 expression and could contribute to the alterations in synaptic functionality, activity, neuro-plasticity observed in AD.
