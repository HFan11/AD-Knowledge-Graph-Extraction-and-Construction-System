Dihydroartemisinin Ameliorates Learning and Memory in Alzheimer’s Disease Through Promoting Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion and Autolysosomal Degradation for Aβ Clearance
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is an active metabolite of sesquiterpene trioxane lactone extracted from Artemisia annua, which is used to treat malaria worldwide.
DHA can activate autophagy, which is the main mechanism to remove the damaged cell components and recover the harmful or useless substances from eukaryotic cells and maintain cell viability through the autophagy lysosomal degradation system.
Autophagy activation and autophagy flux correction are playing an important neuroprotective role in the central nervous system, as they accelerate the removal of toxic protein aggregates intracellularly and extracellularly to prevent neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In this study, we explored whether this mechanism can mediate the neuroprotective effect of DHA on the AD model in vitro and in vivo.
Three months of DHA treatment improved the memory and cognitive impairment, reduced the deposition of amyloid β plaque, reduced the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42, and ameliorated excessive neuron apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice brain.
In addition, DHA treatment increased the level of LC3 II/I and decreased the expression of p62.
After Bafilomycin A1 and Chloroquine (CQ) blocked the fusion of autophagy and lysosome, as well as the degradation of autolysosomes (ALs), DHA treatment increased the level of

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been known as one of the neurodegenerative diseases, manifested by chronic and progressive memory and cognitive deficits
Histopathologically, AD manifests via synaptic abnormalities, neuronal degeneration as well as the deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which lead to a decline in memory and other cognitive functions.
Beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which is mainly produced by the abnormal shearing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by βsecretase and γ-secretase, respectively, is the core of senile plaque (SP) and plays a key role in AD pathogenesis
Excessive production and degradation of Aβ in cells lead to an imbalance and accumulation of Aβ metabolism.
The imbalance of Aβ metabolism further leads to form extracellular SPs and a series of pathological changes of AD.
Aβ excessive formation and blocked degradation impel SP deposition in the brain that, subsequently, accelerate the occurrence of overactive microglia, excessive apoptotic neurons and cerebral atrophy
In recent years, it has been found that extracellular Aβ is only the result of its toxic effect on cells, and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ is the fundamental factor leading to the cytotoxic effects
The degradation of extracellular Aβ is mainly completed by the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and enkephalinase
The autophagy-lysosomal system dysfunction could directly affect APP metabolism and promote β-amyloidogenesis
Thus, maintaining the stability of the autophagy-lysosomal network and strengthening the degradation of Aβ peptides in the lysosomes digestion system might be a promising strategy for treating AD.
Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is the main form of autophagy, and its role in neurodegenerative diseases has attracted much attention.
Autophagy in healthy neurons is characterized by its high efficiency and continuous activation but low level
While in AD, autophagosomes (APs) accumulate owing to the stimulation of initiation of autophagy and sluggish rate of APs formation associated with failure to achieve adequate lysosome fusion as well as digestion
Autophagy increases in the early stage of AD, which can play a role in scavenging Aβ, but excessive autophagy itself can also lead to increased production of Aβ.
With the development of AD, the clearance of Aβ decreased due to the fusion of APs and lysosomes.
The accumulation of APs due to the inhibition of degradation led to the further increase of Aβ production
So it has been reported that autophagy acts as a ''double-edged sword'' in the development of AD
Autophagy flux, the rate at which long-lived protein aggregates are degraded by autophagy
In AD, dysfunctional autophagic flux was characterized as accumulating levels of APs in dystrophic neurites, whereas APP, Aβ peptides, β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) protein, damaged mitochondria and Golgi fragments are rich and cannot be cleared away by endosomal-lysosomal degradation process
Therefore, the accumulation of APs not only affects the clearance of Aβ in cells but also could be the place where Aβ is produced.
With increasing clinical researches and observations on the etiology, pathogenesis and candidate drugs of AD, the drugs which can reduce the production of pathological Aβ and promote the degradation of Aβ will be a new direction for the development of anti-AD drugs.
Thus, maintaining highly efficient autophagy flux in brain homeostasis for maintaining Aβ-related production and degradation balance might be a promising strategy to treat AD.
In recent years, Chinese herbal medicine has received great attention in maintaining the efficient flux of autophagy in the brain.
Artemisinins, a class of sesquiterpene trioxane lactone agents extracted from the ancient Chinese herb Artemisia annua L, has been used effectively to treat malaria
The main mechanism by which artemisinin acts in the treatment of malaria is activating autophagy to change the membrane structure of the parasite and, subsequently, starving the parasite
However, whether artemisinin can treat AD by regulating autophagy or not remains unclear.
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the active metabolite of artemisinin, exhibits an ample array of autophagic activities as a drug intervention in many diseases
One research has shown that DHA could be liable to penetrate the brain-blood barrier
In addition, low doses of DHA have beneficial effects on brain diseases, for example, experimental cerebral malaria in mice
In the present study, we used DHA to treat APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice and AD model cells, intending to investigate whether DHA would maintain Aβ related production and degradation balance via promoting autophagy flux and exert a protective effect in AD.
In vitro and in vivo results suggested that DHA alleviated memory deficits, decreased Aβ production and neuritic plaque formation, ameliorates the autophagy flux in the brains of AD mice.
The multitarget-regulating effects of DHA on autophagic flux were verified in AD cell models pretreated with chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1.
In brief, our data suggest that DHA is effective in the prevention and treatment of AD through promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autolysosomal degradation in autophagic flux to clear Aβ.
FIGURE 1 | Chemical structure of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and experimental protocol scheme.
Mice received intragastric (i.g.) treatments for 90 days until the beginning of the behavioral tests.
From the 93rd day of the experimental protocol, the animals were subjected to Barnes maze tests.
On the 100th day, the mice were euthanized for in vivo analysis.
9-months-old in a laminar flow rack exposed to a 12 h light/dark cycle, with free access to water and standard rodent chow.
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Animal Protection and Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.
Mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuron-2a/APPswe (N2a-APP) cells and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the APPswe gene (APP-SH-SY5Y) were gifts from Professor Zhifang Dong at the Laboratory of Translational Medical Research in Cognitive Development and Learning and Memory Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China), and the APP-SH-SY5Y cells were confirmed to be human through STR profiling.
The N2A-APP cells were maintained in 90% DMEM (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries, USA) with 100 µg/ml G418.
The APP-SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 90% DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.
All cells were maintained at 37 • C in 5% CO 2 and 95% air (v/v).

Drug Treatment/Administration
At 6 months old, APP/PS1 mice and WT mice were randomly divided into the DHA-treated AD group, DMSO-treated AD group, and DMSO-treated WT group (15 per group) and were administered DHA (20 mg/kg/day, intragastric administration, once daily) or an equal amount of DMSO for 3 months.
Pharmacological studies using a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day per mouse were based on the scope of safe doses for adults, children and pregnant women from related studies
In these studies, 3 months of treatment for 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were in accordance with the initial stage of Aβ deposition in this mouse model
After 3 months of treatment, behavioral tests were initiated.
The day after the final day of behavioral tests, the mice were euthanized, and the brains were removed for ex vivo experiments.
The experimental protocol is shown in Figure
Because artemisinin and its derivatives were mainly metabolized in the liver
Bafilomycin A1 was diluted to 1 nM for APP-SH-SY5Y cells and 50 nM for N2A-APP cells
CQ was diluted to 10 µM for APP-SH-SY5Y cells and 25 µM for N2A-APP cells
Rapamycin was diluted to 100 nM for APP-SH-SY5Y cells and N2A-APP cells
The final concentration of DMSO was <0.1%.
The CON groups were treated with the same concentration of DMSO or PBS.

Cell Proliferation Assay
The cells were incubated in 96-well flat-bottom plates (1.0 × 10 4 cells/well) with 0, 0.05, 0.5, 1, 5 and 50 µM DHA for 24 h before cell proliferation was assessed.
Cell growth was analyzed using CCK-8 cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit (Solarbio, Shanghai, China).
Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an ultra microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Behavioral Tests
Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Barnes maze task in accordance with
The Barnes maze consists of a flat, circular disk (122 cm diameter) with 18 circular holes (5 cm diameter) at equal distances around the perimeter and rising 100 cm above the floor.
The escape box (13 × 29 × 14 cm) was kept under one hole.
The mice learned the location of the escape box under the hole using spatial reference points fixed to the wall.
Animals were trained in the Barnes maze on the first day for one trial.
Training consisted of placing the animal in a black box and leaving it for a minute.
Then, the black box was placed in the center of the Barnes maze.
The black box was removed, and then the training began.
The mice freely explored the maze to find the escape box under the hole.
The maximum latency to finding the escape box was 300 s.
The latency to reach the escape box and the number of wrong holes was measured.
After the first day of training, the test began, and the data for two trials were recorded over the next 5 days.
On the seventh day, the escape box was removed, each mouse was placed in the center of the maze.
The number of attempts to find the escape box and the number of other holes was reported.

Preparation of Brain Tissue and Cells
At the end of treatment, the mice were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation.
Mice (n = 16 per group) were perfused transcardially with 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4).
The left cerebral hemisphere was bluntly dissected to the hippocampus and cortex for ELISA, and the right cerebral hemisphere was prepared for histological staining and Western blotting (WB).
The rest cerebral hemisphere was used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
For histological staining, excised brains were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, 20% sucrose for 24 h and 30% sucrose for another 48 h.
Then, the brains were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound in a freezing microtome, and 10 µm-thick sections were cut with a freezing microtome (Leica, Germany).
For TEM, mice from each group were transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS, followed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS.
The brain was quickly stripped in an ice bath.
Brain tissues (1 mm 3 thick) were cut from the hippocampal CA1 area and were fixed in 2.5% special glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h for TEM, washed several times with 0.01 M PBS, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.01 M PBS for 2 h and dehydrated with gradient alcohol.
Tissue samples were embedded in Epon812 epoxy resin.
Tissue blocks were then cut into 1-µm sections, placed on slides, stained with azuremethylene blue
The areas were selected from semi-thin sections and then cut into thin sections.
The APP-N2a cells were prefixed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution overnight at 4 • C and postfixed in cold 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4 • C. The samples were rinsed three times with PBS, dehydrated in a graded series of 25%-100% ethanol, embedded in fresh resin and polymerized at 60 • C for 24 h.
The samples were sectioned on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome at 60-80 nm and collected on pioloform-coated Cu2*1 oval slot grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA).

TEM
After uranyl acetate/lead citrate double staining (Sansd Plastic Co., Ltd, Fujian, China), neurons, gliocytes and their ultrastructures in brain sections were observed by TEM (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands).
For cells, the sections were subsequently examined under a Hitachi7500 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands).
The morphological ultrastructures and status of APs and lysosomes in cells were photographed for each group.

Histological Staining
For Thioflavin S staining, brain slices were mounted onto slides and washed three times with 0.01 M PBS for 5 min each.
The washed brain slices were incubated in acetone for 10 min at room temperature, washed in 80% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water for 30 s, respectively.
After that, slices were incubated in 0.1% KMnO 4 for 30 s and then washed with distilled water, 70% ethanol, and 80% ethanol for 30 s. Subsequently, Thioflavin S (0.1% in 80% ethanol) was dripped on the slides for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.
Finally, the sections were covered with coverslips.
They were then photographed using fluorescence microscopy.
For immunohistochemistry, brain sections were mounted onto slides for staining.
The slices were incubated in 88% formic acid for 10 min and washed in 0.01 M PBS three times.
Then, the slices were incubated in 3% H 2 0 2 peroxidase and citrate buffer (Bioss, Beijing, China; pH 6.0) for 30 min.
Tissues were then blocked with 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah, UT, USA) in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 • C.
Then, the tissues were incubated overnight at 4 • C with the mouse monoclonal antibody 4G8 (1:200 dilution; Biolegend, USA).
After rinsing, a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was added to tissue sections for 30 minutes at 37 • C, followed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Immunoreactivity was visualized.
Plaques were visualized by the ABC and diaminobenzidine (DAB) method and counted under microscopy at 40× magnification.
A minimum of three washes with 0.01 M PBS was completed between steps.
To assess autophagic flux in response to DHA, autophagic agonists and antagonists were used, and a tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus (Hanheng Biotechnology Co Ltd., Shanghai, China) was transfected into cultured APP-SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h at an MOI of 50.
On the 2nd day following transfection, 1 µM DHA, 100 nM rapamycin, 10 µM CQ, and 1 nM bafilomycin A1 were added to the corresponding groups for 24 h.
After fixing the cells with PFA and DAPI staining, autophagy was observed under a TCS-TIV confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems).
The tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 protein showed both red (mRFP) and green (GFP) fluorescence at neutral pH and formed yellow (red+green) puncta that represent APs formation
The relative ratio of positive dots near the nucleus vs. the total number of dots is an index of autophagic flux.

Western Blotting Analysis
Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblot analysis.
Total protein extract was prepared using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), which was supplemented with phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Total protein concentration was determined using an enhanced BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).
Equal amounts of proteins were resolved using a 6%-12% SDS-PAGE gel kit (CWBIO, Beijing, China) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, USA).
The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 • C with the following primary antibodies: SQSTM1/p62 (#5114), LC3 (#3868), Rab7 (#9367), Cathepsin B/CTSB (#31718), ATG5 (DF6010), ATG12 (DF7937), ATG16L1 (DF3825), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; AF6308), phospho-mTOR (Ser2448; AF3308), ULK1 (DF7588), phospho-ATG14 (Ser29; AF2320; all from Affinity Biosciences, USA); ATG14 (NBP2-36445, Novus Bio, USA); RILP (ab140188, Abcam, USA); Beclin1 (ab62557), Lamp1 (ab24170), APP (ab32136), BACE1 (ab183612), Presenilin 1/PS1 (ab76083), IDE (ab133561) and neprilysin/NEP (ab58968).
After washing, the membranes were incubated for an hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
The immunoblots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence WB detection kits and then visualized using a molecular imager with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Protein bands were also quantified with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Equal loading of proteins was verified by β-actin (#A5441, Sigma, USA) and GAPDH (AF7021, Affinity Biosciences, USA) immunoblot analysis.
At least three separate experiments were performed with different lysates to confirm the changes in protein levels.
List of effective concentrations of primary antibodies in Western blotting see Supplementary Figure

ELISA
The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected using ELISA kits by technicians who were blinded to the experimental groups.
For the detection of Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in cells, the cells were washed, trypsinized, and lysed in extraction buffer (1% CHAPS in TBS, pH 7.6).
Intracellular Aβ40 and Aβ42 were then detected.
The volume of the medium used was adjusted to the protein concentrations measured in total cell lysates.
For the detection of soluble or insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the brains of WT and APP/PS1 mice, dissected tissue was homogenized in 5 volumes of extraction buffer (1% CHAPS in TBS, pH 7.6).
Then, all mixtures were placed on ice for at least 3 h.
The homogenates were centrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 • C, and the supernatants were diluted with EIA buffer contained in the kit for the analysis of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42.

DISCUSSION
The brain neuropathology of AD is characterized by synaptic abnormalities and neuronal degeneration, as well as extracellular Aβ deposition and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, leading to a decline in memory and other cognitive functions
Recent studies have suggested that the molecular level of autophagic maintenance might be a suitable way to treat AD as well as some other neurodegenerative diseases, since it could not only prevent cell death but also effectively degrade pathological proteins, such as Aβ, p-Tau, α-synuclein, and glutamine repeats
Autophagy, as a lysosomal mediated process of cell self-processing, is closely related to the clearance of abnormal accumulation of AD-related proteins.
However, a large number of studies have reported that there are dual roles for autophagy, which are degradation and secretion of AD Aβ peptide
There are a large number of APs and autolysosomes (ALs) in the brain of AD patients, which are caused by the activation of autophagy on the one hand, the fusion obstacle between APs and lysosome, or the degradation reduction of ALs on the other hand.
In the early stage of AD, autophagy can accelerate the clearance of denatured protein and promote the survival of neurons.
With the development of AD, the aggregation of APs is increased and the clearance of ALs decreased.
Therefore, it is of great scientific significance to study the dynamic changes of autophagy flux in the pathogenesis of AD and to find new targets for the prevention and treatment of AD.
DHA, the active metabolite of artemisinin, may meet the conditions for the induction of basal autophagy and correction of autophagic flux
However, no study has mentioned the therapeutic effect of DHA in AD regarding the degradation of toxic aggregated proteins by inducing autophagy.
Thus, it is vital to determine the potential effects and mechanisms of DHA treatment on AD.
In the present study, Barnes maze test results showed that DHA administration by gastric perfusion for 3 months exhibited a protective effect on learning and memory impairment in the APP/PS1 double transgenic mice.
Then we found that the diameters of SP were smaller and the densities of SP were lower in the DHA-treated group compared with those of the DMSO-treated group, which supports our assumption that DHA may prevent the aggregation of Aβ and deposition of SP.
The main forms of Aβ in the brain are Aβ40 and Aβ42, the latter is more prone to amyloidosis and toxicity.
To verify the potential effects of DHA on the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the cortex and hippocampus, ELISA results showed that the levels of Aβ42 in both the cortex and hippocampus and of Aβ40 in the cortex were markedly reduced by oral DHA, which indicates that DHA may normalize the burden of Aβ42 that acts as more harmful peptides prone to misfolding and aggregating, but not Aβ40, and plays a central role in the pathological course of AD
In addition, hippocampal neurons are more prone to protein aggregation than neurons in the cortex, which may suggest that this selective difference is closely related to the degradation rate of aggregated proteins; the degradation rate is based on cell-and region-specific autophagy activity and vulnerability of substrates to clearance via autophagy, possibly due to neuronal dependency on autophagic flux
We found that the anti-Aβ42 effect of DHA on the cortex was more significant than that on the hippocampus, as well as the anti-Aβ40 effect of DHA on the cortex.
Consequently, we considered that DHA exhibited neuroprotective effects in AD.
The imbalance of Aβ metabolism leads to the formation of extracellular SPs and a series of pathological changes.
Aβ is formed by the cleavage of APP protein by βand γ-secretase, and BACE1 and PS1 are the active centers of βand γ-secretases, respectively.
In this study, the results showed that compared with the control group, the levels of APP and BACE1 protein were down-regulated after DHA treatment, indicating that Aβ production was reduced.
Then we tested the degradation of Aβ.
The degradation of extracellular Aβ is mainly completed by IDE and NEP
However, our results showed that DHA treatment did not significantly change the levels of IDE and NEP proteins compared with the control group.
While the degradation of intracellular Aβ is mainly transported to lysosome through endocytosis or autophagy, there is increasing evidence that autophagy dysfunction accompanies the development of AD
Dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosome pathway is closely related to the production, clearance and neurotoxicity of Aβ.
In the current study, TEM results showed that there were a large number of normal neurons in the brain of DHA-treated mice as the WT mice.
In addition, double-membraned APs enveloped organelles and cytosolic proteins instead of aberrant myelin accumulation occurred in DHA-treated neurons.
At the same time, no DNs and neurons with autophagic dysfunction could be found in DHA-treated neurons.
Therefore we speculate that autophagy could be markedly improved by DHA treatment in an AD mouse model.
The levels of autophagy-associated proteins were assessed by WB to verify the hypothesis that oral DHA could protect against AD pathophysiology by inducing autophagy in AD-like neurons.
We found that the level of SQSRM1/p62 increased and the ratio of LC3 II/I decreased in AD brains compared with that of WT brains, which indicates low autophagic activity and obstructed autophagic flux in AD pathogenesis
The relatively low level of LC3 II along with a high level of Aβ burden in AD mice brain might be explained by the lack of a potential protective role for LC3-associated endocytosis that downregulates the levels of neurotoxic Aβ
We next investigated the mechanism by which DHA activates autophagy.
The first step is autophagy initiation and APs formation.
The levels of proteins associated with isolation of AP membranes from the ER, such as ULK1 and Atg14, proteins associated with the elongation of AP membranes, such as ATG12, ATG5, ATG16L1, and LC3.
The second step is AL formation (via the fusion of APs and lysosomes), proteins associated with the ALs fusion, such as ATG14, p-ATG14, Rab7, and RILP.
The third step is AL degradation: autophagy-encapsulated proteins are released by CTSB and CTSD degradation, and lysosomal acidification plays an important role in their degradation.
The WB results showed that the expression of proteins involved in the early stage of autophagy, such as ATG5, ATG12 and ATG16L, were upregulated in DHA treated group, indicating that autophagy was activated.
At the middle stage of autophagy, the levels of LC3 II/I were increased, and the p62 protein level was decreased, indicating that autophagy was induced by DHA treatment.
ATG14 has been shown to form a complex with Beclin1 in the early stage of autophagy and promote the fusion of APs and lysosomes in the middle stage of autophagy
However, after treatment with DHA, the levels of Beclin1, ATG14, Rab7 and RILP proteins were significantly increased, indicating that DHA treatment not only activated autophagy but also promoted the fusion of autophagy and lysosome.
Studies have shown that reducing the content of proteases in lysosomes and inhibiting the activity of lysosomal enzymes can lead to the accumulation of Aβ in cells.
In addition, the endocytosis of Aβ can, in turn, reduce the function of lysosomes and affect the degradation of Aβ by lysosomes
The results of this study showed that the protein expression of the lysosomal protease CTSB and the lysosomal marker Lamp1 in the DHA-treated mice increased compared with that of the CRTL group, suggesting that DHA treatment can also increase the number of lysosomes and their degradation function.
GSK3β-TIP60-ULK1 pathway and mTOR/ ULK1 pathway are two classic autophagy activation pathways
In this study, WB showed that DHA inhibited the activity of mTOR, then activated ULK, indicating that DHA can also activate autophagy by inhibiting the mTOR/ ULK1 signaling pathway, but DHA does not activate autophagy by activating GSK3.
To clarify the potential mechanisms by which DHA affects autophagic flux, N2a-APP cells and APP-SH-SY5Y cells were treated with DHA, followed by treatment with bafilomycin A1, an autophagic fusion agonist, CQ, and autophagic degradation agonist, and rapamycin, an autophagic initiation antagonist.
We found that DHA indeed accelerated the degradation of p62 in the cell model compared with that of the CON group.
In addition, CQ treatment significantly hampered the degradation of p62 in the cell model, which was consistent with its inhibition of degradative enzyme activity
To detect the process of APs formation mediated by DHA, autophagic agonists and antagonist, TEM and shoots for puncta formation of fluorescent-tagged LC3 proteins in the cytoplasm under fluorescence microscopy were utilized
We found that a large number of lipid droplets and large lysosomes accumulated in the cytoplasm near the nucleus after CQ treatment.
Increasing the accumulation of lysosomes indicates that APs and their contents could not be cleared smoothly by lysosomes, which was notably improved in the CQ-DHA group.
The phenomenon was also detected by fluorescence microscopy in the CQ group and the CQ-DHA group, in which positive puncta that aggregated near the nucleus were corrected by DHA treatment.
Then, we found that the reinforced degradation of p62 by DHA was not disrupted by bafilomycin A1, an autophagic degradation agonist that inhibits the transport of lysosomal protons and leads to blocking the fusion between APs and lysosomes
In addition, DHA not only upregulated the basal level of LC3 II in N2a-APP cells compared with that of the CON group but also reversed the accumulation of LC3 II caused by bafilomycin A1 treatment.
Moreover, a mass of stacked APs dyed dark gray (indicating late APs) in the cytoplasm in the Bafi group were mostly replaced by APs dyed light gray (indicating early APs) in the Bafi-DHA group; however, a few late APs were still measured by TEM.
The trend was also consistent with the trend in the Bafi group and the Bafi-DHA group under fluorescence microscopy.
In addition, differences between the effects of DHA and rapamycin on autophagy mediation and the Aβ clearance are discussed in our study.
Unlike rapamycin-induced initiation of autophagy to improve Aβ pathology
Moreover, we found that DHA helps clear Aβ42 levels in both the cortex and hippocampus and Aβ40 levels in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice, but rapamycin downregulates Aβ42 but not Aβ40 levels
In parallel, normal autophagy is induced by the formation of APs that initiate at the phagophore assembly site; nucleation of the phagophore, sequestration of substrates, and expansion of the double membrane are involved in this process, which is markedly hindered in AD pathology.
To reverse this process, DHA upregulated the levels of the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L complex to facilitate LC3 lipidation (LC3 I) with phosphatidylethanolamine that was inhibited by AD-like pathogenesis .
In addition, the treatment of DHA protected against the bafilomycin A1-induced abnormal fusion of APs and late endosomes, ameliorated the CQ-mediated loss of lysosomal degradation function, and finally promoted the degradation of Aβ40 and Aβ42.
for Aβ clearance.
Thus, based on the evidence above, we found that DHA treatment can contribute to the clearance of Aβ by maintaining autophagy flux in vivo and in vitro (Figure

CONCLUSION
Overall, DHA treatment can ameliorate behavioral and biochemical deficits in an AD mouse model.
The major mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of DHA involve enhancing autophagy, avoiding excessive neuronal death and recovering autophagic flux in AD models in vivo and in vitro.
As AD is undoubtedly caused by multiple factors, and there are many pathological ongoing processes, including a shortage of neurotrophic factors, accumulation of aggregated proteins and progressive neuron loss, one might assume that effective treatment of this disease should include corrections to all these processes.
This study demonstrated that DHA can prevent neurons death through raising the overall level of autophagy and maintaining the proper function of autophagy flux in the fusion and degradation stages that predominantly reduces the burden of pathological proteins (such as Aβ40, Aβ42, in this work) in AD models in vivo and in vitro.
Hence, DHA, the active metabolite of Artemisia annua, might be a multifunctional molecule capable of correcting the pathology of this disease.
Owing to the fact that DHA has been shown to be safe and versatile in many clinical trials worldwide, we suggest that the use of this compound might be considered a therapeutic treatment to reduce and/or prevent symptoms of AD in humans.
