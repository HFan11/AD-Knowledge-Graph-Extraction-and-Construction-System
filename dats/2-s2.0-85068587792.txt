ADAMTS13 maintains cerebrovascular integrity to ameliorate Alzheimer-like pathology
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) defects and cerebrovascular dysfunction contribute to amyloid-β (Aβ) brain accumulation and drive Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology.
By regulating vascular functions and inflammation in the microvasculature, a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) plays a significant protective effect in atherosclerosis and stroke.
However, whether ADAMTS13 influences AD pathogenesis remains unclear.
Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy, histological, behavioral, and biological methods, we determined BBB integrity, cerebrovascular dysfunction, amyloid accumulation, and cognitive impairment in APPPS1 mice lacking ADAMTS13.
We also tested the impact of viral-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 on cerebrovascular function and AD-like pathology in APPPS1 mice.
We show that ADAMTS13 deficiency led to an early and progressive BBB breakdown as well as reductions in vessel density, capillary perfusion, and cerebral blood flow in APPPS1 mice.
We found that deficiency of ADAMTS13 increased brain plaque load and Aβ levels and accelerated cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) by impeding BBB-mediated clearance of brain Aβ, resulting in worse cognitive decline in APPPS1 mice.
Virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 attenuated BBB disruption and increased microvessels, capillary perfusion, and cerebral blood flow in APPPS1 mice already showing BBB damage and plaque deposition.
These beneficial vascular effects were reflected by increase in clearance of cerebral Aβ, reductions in Aβ brain accumulation, and improvements in cognitive performance.
Our results show that ADAMTS13 deficiency contributes to AD cerebrovascular dysfunction and the resulting pathogenesis and cognitive deficits and suggest that ADAMTS13 may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with distinct cerebrovascular abnormalities and cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)
In the AD brain, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and cerebrovascular dysfunction have been suggested to contribute to the pathology and cognitive deficits
von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein that is elevated during aging and in patients with vascular dementia
The multimeric size of VWF is regulated by a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), which processed proteolytically VWF into smaller and less reactive fragments
ADAMTS13 deficiency results in ultralarge VWF (UL-VWF) multimers in the circulation, causing vascular dysfunction and inflammation in the microvasculature
A reduced plasma ADAMTS13 activity and increased VWF levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, stroke, and vascular remodeling
In experimental animal models, VWF was reported to release upon endothelium injury and promote vascular leakage
However, whether the ADAMTS13-VWF axis can modulate cerebrovascular functions influencing AD pathology remains unclear.
An early BBB breakdown and microvascular reduction have been demonstrated in AD patients
Increasing evidence also suggests that neurovascular dysfunction is critical for Aβ accumulation in blood vessels and parenchyma of the brain of AD patients and its associated dementia
Because deficiency of ADAMTS13 leads to increased VWF-dependent vascular dysfunction
To address this issue, we investigated the effect of ADAMTS13 deletion on BBB integrity, cerebrovascular degeneration, Aβ deposition, and cognitive function in mice expressing mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1).
We also evaluated the efficacy of virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 on vascular dysfunction, AD pathogenesis, and cognitive deficits in APPPS1 mice.

Results

Characterization of APPPS1 and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice
To examine the levels of human APP in brains of transgenic mice, we subjected brain homogenates to immunoblot analyses using the human-Aβ-specific antibody 6E10
The presence of full-length 100/105 kDa human APP can only be seen in homogenates from APPPS1 and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice (S1A Fig) .
Immunoblot analyses with the antibody that recognizes both human and mouse APP indicated a marked increase in APP protein expression in the brains of transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic mice (S1B Fig)

ADAMTS13 activities and VWF levels in plasma
We analyzed mice for plasma ADAMTS13 activity.
We found a significant reduction in plasma ADAMTS13 activity in 12-month-old APPPS1 mice compared with age-matched WT mice and 2-and 6-month-old APPPS1 mice (Fig 1A ).
A slight but not statistically significant decrease in ADAMTS13 activity was observed in 6-month-old APPPS1 mice compared with 2-month-old APPPS1 mice, suggesting a reduction of ADAMTS13 activity with age in APPPS1 mice.
Because the only known substrate for ADAMTS13 is VWF
This analysis indicated that Adamts13 -/-and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice at 2, 6, and 12 months of age exhibited greater increases in plasma VWF levels compared with age-matched WT and APPPS1 mice
Deficiency of ADAMTS13 in APPPS1 mice resulted in an age-dependent increase in plasma VWF levels.
Plasma VWF levels also were significantly increased in 12-month-old APPPS1 mice compared with age-matched WT mice and 2-month-old APPPS1 mice.
Moreover, we observed a marked increase in the ratio of plasma UL-VWF to low-molecular-weight VWF multimers in 12-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/- mice compared with age-matched APPPS1 littermates (Fig 1C

ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to early and progressive BBB breakdown in APPPS1 mice
We quantified BBB permeability by in vivo multiphoton imaging assays of a vascular tracer, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (molecular weight (MW) = 40,000 Da).
In contrast to the intact BBB observed in 2-month-old WT, Adamts13 -/-, or APPPS1 mice, the BBB was leaky in age-matched APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-littermate mice (Fig 2A
Similarly, immunostaining of fibrin with platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) showed significant perivascular fibrin deposits in the hippocampus and cortex of 2-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice (Fig
Additionally, immunoblot analysis of fibrin in capillary-depleted brain tissue revealed that fibrin accumulated significantly in the brain parenchyma of 2-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice but not in WT, Adamts13 -/-, or APPPS1 littermate mice (S2B and S2C Fig) .
Multiphoton microscopy analysis of FITC-dextran leakage and quantification of perivascular fibrin deposits indicated that BBB permeability increased with increasing age in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice (Fig 2A
APPPS1 mice showed increased BBB permeability at 12 months of age, consistent with earlier reports that BBB breakdown was present in this transgenic mice at 9 to 12 months of age
However, in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice, the brains were substantially more permeable at this age.
Together, these data indicate that ADAMTS13 deletion is sufficient to induce early and progressive BBB damage in APPPS1 mice.
To investigate whether the BBB breakdown could be related to altered endothelial junctions, we analyzed the expression of junctional proteins in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice.
Immunoblotting showed progressive age-dependent loss of the tight junction protein Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) and the adherens junction protein vascular endothelial-cadherin (VEcadherin) in isolated brain capillaries of APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice compared with agematched WT, Adamts13 -/-, or APPPS1 littermate mice (Fig

ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions in APPPS1 mice
To address whether the early BBB breakdown and loss of the BBB properties in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice were associated with microvascular degeneration, brain capillary density was analyzed by CD31 staining.
We found greater than 36% to 39% and 29% to 38% reductions in capillary density in 6-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively, when compared with other genotypes
At 12 months, APPPS1 mice displayed 31% and 36% reductions in cortical and hippocampal capillary density, respectively, when compared with WT littermates, as reported
ADAMTS13 deficiency in APPPS1 mice resulted in even greater than 25% and 41% reductions in cortical and hippocampal capillary density compared with APPPS1 mice.
There was no difference in capillary density among 2-month-old WT, Adamts13 -/-, APPPS1, and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice.
To test whether the reduced capillary density reflects a decrease in brain capillary perfusion, we assessed the cortical vasculature using in vivo multiphoton microscopy imaging of intravenously injected FITC-dextran (MW = 2,000,000 Da).
This analysis revealed a significant capillary perfusion deficit with a 34% to 40% reduction in the length of perfused cortical capillaries in 6-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice compared with WT, Adamts13 -/-, and APPPS1 littermate mice (Fig 3B
Compared with WT littermate mice, 12-month-old APPPS1 mice showed a 37% reduction in the length of perfused cortical capillaries, but this was less marked than the 59% reduction observed in age-matched APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice.
Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI of intravenously injected contrast agent gadopentetate dimeglumine revealed a significantly greater 43% reduction in hippocampal blood flow in 12-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice compared with WT littermates that was more potent than the 24% reduction found in APPPS1 mice (Fig 3E
These data are consistent with previous reports showing that regional brain capillary density correlates with blood flow

ADAMTS13 deficiency accelerates AD pathology and impairs cognitive function in APPPS1 mice
Next, we examined whether ADAMTS13 deficiency causing brain vascular damage and regional cerebral blood flow reduction can influence Aβ pathology in APPPS1 mice.
At 12 months of age, soluble and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 were increased by 62%, 52%, 62%, and 36% in brains of APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice, respectively, compared with those in APPPS1 littermates (Fig 4A
Aβ immunostaining and thioflavin S (ThS) staining confirmed this observation, showing that the cortical and hippocampal plaque load were markedly elevated in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice compared with APPPS1 mice (Fig 4C
Furthermore, APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice developed 2.3-fold and 1.7-fold increases in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and parenchymal amyloid deposition, respectively, as measured by in vivo multiphoton imaging of methoxy-X04 + amyloid plaques and Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)dextran angiopathy (Fig 4F
Notably, the CAA load was positively correlated with the BBB permeability determined by the permeability surface (PS) product for FITC-dextran in APPPS1 and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice (Fig
To determine whether ADAMTS13 deficiency in APPPS1 mice affected Aβ production and APP processing, we examined APP metabolism.
Consistent with previous reports
However, the levels of these proteins were similar in APPPS1 and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice, suggesting that accelerated Aβ brain accumulation and CAA observed in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice did not result from increased Aβ production and processing.
Another key mechanism underlying increased Aβ brain accumulation is reduced clearance of Aβ from the brain
Therefore, we tested whether the expression of the Aβ BBB-transporting proteins is altered in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice.
Western blot analysis of Aβ efflux transporters in isolated brain capillaries revealed significant down-regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in APPPS1 mice compared with WT mice (Fig 4I
We then found a marked decrease in LRP1 and P-gp in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice compared with APPPS1 mice.
The level of the Aβ influx transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) did not change APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice.

Using established protocols
This analysis showed a significant reduction in the plasma levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 at 40 minutes after injection of HJ5.1 in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice compared with APPPS1 mice (Fig 4K
Finally, we tested whether overexpression of LRP1 in brain microvessels in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice affects Aβ pathology.
Consistent with findings that LRP1 is a key Aβ clearance protein
At 12 months, APPPS1 mice had significant impairments of learning and memory (Fig 5A, 5B and 5C), consistent with earlier reports
Compared with APPPS1 mice, APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice showed significantly worse performance, as indicated by a significant increase in the escape latency time during the hidden platform test (Fig 5A ), fewer platform crossings (Fig 5B ), and shorter time spent in the platform quadrants (Fig 5C ) during the probe trials.
We next used the Y-maze test.
APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice exhibited a significantly lower rate of spontaneous alternations than other genotypes (Fig 5D ), indicating a more severe working memory deficit.
We also performed the passive avoidance test to assess the cognitive functions of animals
This analysis showed that all mice exhibited comparable initial latencies to enter the dark compartment (Fig
Compared with other groups, APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice took a shorter time to reenter the dark compartment during the retention session, showing an impairment of memory.
In addition, animals were tested in the open-field test.
We found a significantly lower number of rearings (Fig 5F ) and a shorter traveling distance (S8 Fig)
These data indicate that APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice had worse locomotor activity than the control APPPS1 mice.
To examine whether early cerebrovascular changes in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice are associated with cognitive decline, the Y-maze test was performed in 5-month-old mice.
Consistent with previous reports
ADAMTS13 deficiency caused further worsening of performance in APPPS1 mice.
Reduced dendritic spines have been implicated in cognitive impairment of AD
We next examined whether impaired vascular functions by ADAMTS13 deficiency could induce synaptic dysfunction.
Golgi staining revealed a 24% reduction in dendritic length (Fig 5H
In contrast, 2-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice did not show evidence of Aβ deposition and synaptic loss (S9A, S9D and S9E Fig) .
The levels of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in brains of 2-month-old APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-were comparable to that of age-matched APPPS1 mice (S9B and S9C Fig) .
To further determine whether ADAMTS13 deficiency may affect the synaptic function, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings on hippocampal CA1 neurons in brain slices from 2-month-old mice.
There were no significant changes in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and amplitude among WT, Adamts13 -/-, APPPS1, and APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice (S9F, S9G and S9H Fig) .
However, BBB breakdown and loss of endothelial junctions in APPPS1-Adamts13  that vascular damage precedes the development of plaque load and synaptic dysfunction in the brain of APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice.

Virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 reverses BBB breakdown and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions in APPPS1 mice
Next, we studied the role of ADAMTS13 in APPPS1 mice by injecting recombinant adenoassociated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated expression of a murine ADAMTS13 variant (AAV8-ADAMTS13) into the hippocampi of 9-month-old APPPS1 mice, which already exhibited vascular damage, plaque deposition, and cognitive deficits
After 3 months of virus injection, the mice were tested at 12 months of age.
Confocal microscopy analysis for red fluorescent protein (RFP) indicated that the cortex and hippocampus were extensively transduced at 3 months after injection (Fig
Expression of the truncated ADAMTS13 variant in the cortex and hippocampus was demonstrated by immunoblot analyses, using the antibody that recognizes the metalloproteinase domain of ADAMTS13 (Fig
Multiphoton microscopy analysis of FITC-dextran indicated a substantial reduction in BBB permeability in APPPS1 mice treated with AAV8-ADAMTS13 compared with control mice treated with AAV8-RFP (Fig 6C
No significant differences were observed in microvascular pericytes between control and AAV8-ADAMTS13 adenovirus groups (Fig
Administration of AAV8-ADAMTS13 into APPPS1 mice also caused a significant increase in the capillary density in the cortex and hippocampus and the length of perfused cortical microvessels (Fig 6F, 6G, 6H and 6I).
Contrast perfusion MRI revealed that AAV8-ADAMTS13 treatment restored hippocampal blood flow in APPPS1 mice (Fig 6J

Virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 reduces Aβ deposition to improve cognitive deficits of APPPS1 mice
We asked whether the improved vascular function and regional cerebral blood flow by AAV8-ADAMTS13 could improve AD pathology.
At 12 months, APPPS1 mice that received AAV8-ADAMTS13 exhibited reduced levels of brain-soluble and -insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 relative to AAV8-RFP-treated controls (Fig 7A
The cerebral Aβ plaque load was markedly reduced by 41% and 46% in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively, in APPPS1 mice subjected to AAV8-ADAMTS13 injection (Fig
Western blot analysis of isolated brain capillaries revealed that AAV8-ADAMTS13 injection led to significantly higher levels of Aβ BBB-transporting proteins LRP1 and P-gp than did AAV8-RFP injection (Fig 7G
In line with these data, we found significantly increased Aβ elimination from brain to blood in mice injected with AAV8-ADAMTS13 (Fig 7I
Collectively, these results suggest that the ADAMTS13 expression by virus administration likely decreased Aβ accumulation in the brains of APPPS1 mice via increased BBB-mediated Aβ clearance.
We next determine the roles of ADAMTS13 in Aβ uptake and degradation in human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells.
Aβ uptake was assessed by the addition of Aβ1-42 labeled with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM-Aβ42) to the media of hCMEC/D3 cells in the presence and absence of human recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13).
This analysis showed that the levels of intracellular Aβ42 was enhanced in a time-dependent manner (Fig 7K ).
Treatment with rADAMTS13 significantly increased Aβ42 uptake following 30, 45, and 60 minutes of FAM-Aβ42 incubation compared with vehicle-treated hCMEC/D3 cells.
To quantify Aβ42 degradation, hCMEC/D3 cells were incubated with FAM-Aβ42 for 1 hour, followed by additional incubation for 2 hours without FAM-Aβ42.
The levels of Aβ42 remaining were measured by ELISA and defined as degraded Aβ.
We found that more Aβ42 was degraded by rADAMTS13-treated hCMEC/D3 cells (Fig
Because astrocytes can take up and degrade Aβ
We observed a time-dependent increase in Aβ42 uptake in astrocytes (S11A Fig).
However, Aβ42 uptake was not significantly change by rADAMTS13.
ELISA analysis Taken together, our results indicate that ADAMTS13 increased both the uptake and clearance of Aβ42 in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells but not in astrocytes.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that ADAMTS13 may also play a role in mediating Aβ clearance in other cell types.
The dendritic spine density in the hippocampal CA1 region was significantly increased in APPPS1 mice injected with AAV8-ADAMTS13 (Fig 7M
We then tested whether the reversal of dendritic spine deficits in APPPS1 mice could induce functional changes.
In MWM tests, APPPS1 mice injected with AAV8-ADAMTS13 took a shorter time to find the hidden

Discussion
In this study, we crossed the APPPS1 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis with Adamts13 -/- mice and found that APPPS1 mice lacking ADAMTS13 showed early and progressive BBB damage, capillary degeneration, and decreased blood flow.
These cerebrovascular changes were associated with increased cerebral amyloid pathology and accelerated cognitive decline.
In contrast, virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 in the brain of APPPS1 mice reversed the vascular phenotype, AD-type pathologies, and behavioral deficits.
Moreover, we demonstrated that the beneficial effect of ADAMTS13 appears to be due to increased Aβ clearance from brain to plasma as a consequence of improved BBB function.
There is increasing evidence that dysfunction of cerebral blood vessels is an early pathological event that occurs in dementia, including AD
We found that ADAMTS13 deficiency induced BBB damage in the early disease stage in APPPS1 mice, characterized by increased extravasation of administered FITC-dextran and serum fibrin and changes in endothelial junctions defined by loss of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin.
Consistent with previous reports that chronic BBB breakdown leads to microvascular dysfunction and elevated brain Aβ levels
We further found reduced Aβ efflux transporters LRP1 and P-gp levels and Aβ brain-to-blood clearance in APPPS1 mice lacking ADAMTS13.
Aβ pathology was reversed in Aβ40 (panel I) and Aβ42 (panel J) before, 10 minutes after, and 40 minutes after the Aβ-stabilizing anti-Aβ antibody HJ5.1 injection in APPPS1 mice treated with AAV8-ADAMTS13 or control (n = 6).
(K) Internalization levels of Aβ42 were analyzed by flow cytometry in vehicle and rADAMTS13-treated hCMEC/ D3 cells after incubation with FAM-Aβ42 for 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes (n = 5).
(L) hCMEC/D3 cells were incubated with FAM-Aβ42 for 1 hour, washed, and then incubated with FAM-Aβ42-free medium for 2 hours in the presence or absence of rADAMTS13.

the hippocampus of APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice with adenoviral-mediated overexpression of LRP1.
These results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance is critical for Aβ metabolism in the brain
These findings also suggest that reduced vascular clearance of Aβ may contribute to the mechanisms by which ADAMTS13 deletion increased CAA formation and Aβ deposition.
Moreover, the increased Aβ brain-to-blood clearance in AAV8-ADAMTS13-treated APPPS1 mice was linked to reduced BBB defects.
Together, our data suggest that ADAMTS13 may reduce CAA formation and Aβ accumulation by preserving BBB integrity and the associated improvement in cerebrovascular function and restoration of vascular responses.
Previous studies revealed that higher levels of VWF are seen in older adults and patients with vascular dementia
However, the role of VWF and its cleaving protease ADAMTS13 in AD remains unknown.
In this study, using an experimental model of AD, we have identified ADAMTS13 as an important regulator of AD-like pathology and cognitive decline.
We also showed a significant increase in plasma VWF levels and a concomitant decrease in ADAMTS13 activity in APPPS1 mice at 12 months of age.
Deficiency of ADAMTS13 in APPPS1 mice resulted in even greater increase in plasma VWF levels and UL-VWF multimers.
Recent reports have demonstrated that ADMATS13 deficiency resulted in increased vascular injury
Hence, it is possible that the phenotype of Aβ-associated cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairments observed in APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice was caused by the synergistic pathological effects between VWF and Aβ.
However, whether levels of ADAMTS13 in AD patients are reduced and its pathophysiologic relevance warrant further investigation.
BBB dysfunction and hypoperfusion have been linked to many pathological conditions of the central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, and AD
Our findings show that ADAMTS13 deficiency caused early cerebrovascular damage, resulting in microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions, which in turn diminished BBB-mediated Aβ clearance and thereby worsened behavioral deficits.
Our data demonstrate that virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 in brains of APPPS1 transgenic mice led to decreased vascular insults and Aβ accumulation and improvement of cognitive performance.
We propose that approaches to restore vascular functions may provide therapeutic value for improving cognitive decline in AD patients.

In vivo multiphoton imaging
In vivo time-lapse multiphoton images were taken as we previously described
Briefly, in the parietal bone, a 2-mm-diameter window was opened, and a sterile cover glass was placed above the brain.
Image experiments were performed using a multiphoton laser-scanning microscope (FV1200MPE, Olympus, Japan).
Cerebrovascular permeability was evaluated by time-lapse imaging taken every 180 seconds for 20 minutes after FITC-dextran (40,000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich; 0.1 ml of 10 mg/ml) injection.
To analyze perfusion of cortical microvessels, 0.1 ml bolus of FITC-dextran (2,000,000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich; 10 mg/ml) was injected intravenously.
Multiphoton z-stack images were obtained from 200 μm below the surface of the cortex to a depth of 500 μm.
To visualize amyloid plaques, methoxy-XO4 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK; 10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into mice.
Twelve hours later, the mice were anesthetized and implanted with a cranial window, and amyloid imaging was performed
TMR-conjugated dextran (70,000 Da; Invitrogen, MA; 0.1 ml of 10 mg/ml) was intravenously injected before imaging to provide a fluorescent angiogram.

Injection of adeno-associated virus vectors
Recombinant AAV8 encoding a C-terminal truncated murine ADAMTS13 variant (aa 1-2400) (pAAV8-CMV-ADAMTS13-P2A-mCherry-3FLAG) under a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and control adenovirus only expressing the RFP AAV (pAAV8-CMV-P2A-mCherry-3FLAG) were prepared by Obio Technology (Shanghai, China).
Previous studies have documented the safety and long-term expression of this AAV8-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 variant in a murine model of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
ADAMTS13 and RFP AAV8 were stereotactically bilaterally injected into the hippocampus (5 × 10 12 viral genomes/ml, 2 μl per hippocampus) of the mice at 9 months of age.
The following coordinates were used: anteroposterior +2.0 mm, mediolateral ±1.5 mm, and dorsoventral -1.5 mm
The adenovirus carrying a human LRP1 minigene (Adv-mLRP1) and empty adenovirus (Adv-Con) were prepared (Obio Technology, Shanghai, China) and injected into the hippocampus of APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice at 12 months of age, as described by Winkler and colleagues
Injection of Adv-mLRP1 effectively induced the expression of LRP1 minigene in the hippocampus of APPPS1-Adamts13 -/-mice (S7A Fig).

MWM
Experiments were conducted by investigators blinded to genotypes or treatments of mice for all behavioral measurements.
The MWM was used to test spatial learning and reference memory functions

The passive avoidance test was assessed in a step-through box apparatus (Med Associates, St Albans, VT) consisting of a light compartment and a dark compartment
The floor of each compartment contained a grid, with only the dark one being electrified by a generator.
The mice were placed into the light compartment, and after 60 seconds, the guillotine door was opened.
The latency to enter the dark compartment was recorded.
Once entering the dark compartment, the mice received an immediate electrical shock (0.5 mA for 1 second).
Mice were then returned to the home cages.
After 24 hours, each mouse was again placed into the light compartment, and the latency to enter into the dark compartment was recorded for up to 300 seconds.

Open-field test
Mice were tested for 5 minutes in a clear 27.3 × 27.3 × 40 cm activity chamber (Med Associates, VT) with three 16-beam infrared arrays.
See details in S1 Text.

Tissue preparation and ThS staining
Mice were deeply anesthetized; brains were removed and immersed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4˚C.
Frozen coronal sections of the brain were cut at 15-μm thickness with a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, IL) and stored at -80˚C until use.
For ThS staining, brain sections were incubated in 1% ThS (T1892, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) for 10 minutes and rinsed in PBS.
See details in S1 Text.

Immunohistochemistry
Frozen coronal brain sections were immunostained as described previously
See details in S1 Text.

Analysis of extravascular fibrin deposition
Cerebral tissue cryosections were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS and incubated with a combination of antibodies of rat anti-CD31 (PECAM-1; 553370, 1:400; BD Pharmingen, NJ) and rabbit anti-fibrin (ogen) (AP00766PU-N, 1:2,000; Acris Antibodies, Germany) overnight at 4˚C.
The sections were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rat IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, CA).
To quantify extravascular deposits of fibrin, the images were contrast enhanced to clearly differentiate positivity from background and quantified using the NIH ImageJ integrated density analysis tool.
For each animal, 6 fields from the cortex and 4 fields from the hippocampus in 6 sections (100 μm apart) were analyzed.

Preparation of brain microvessels and capillary-depleted brain homogenates
Mouse brain capillaries were isolated as previously described
Briefly, brains were removed, and the meninges and large surface vessels were discarded.
Brain tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 16% dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with a glass dounce tissue grinder.
Homogenates were centrifuged at 6,000g for 15 minutes at 4˚C.
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again to obtain capillarydepleted brain homogenates.
Pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA and passed through a 100-μm and 40-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA).
Microvessels were collected from the 40-μm strainer membrane and used for experiments.

Western blotting
Brain tissues, brain capillaries, and capillary-depleted brain homogenates were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore, MO) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).
Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, MA).
Signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (PerkinElmer) and imaged using a ChemiDoc Touch imaging system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
See details in S1 Text.

ADAMTS13 activity assay
ADAMTS13 activity in plasma was determined using a commercial FRETS-VWF73 peptide (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) according to the manufacturera ˆs instructions.
Briefly, FRETS-VWF73 (100 μl of 4 mM, final concentration 2 μM) was incubated with 4 μl plasma in reaction buffer (5 mM Bis-Tris, 25 mM CaCl2, 0.005% Tween-20 [pH 6.0]).
Fluorescence intensities were detected with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Bio-Tech, Winooski, VT) every 5 minutes for 1 hour using excitation at 340 nm and emission at 450 nm.

Assay of VWF levels
VWF levels in plasma was measured as described by Zhu and colleagues
Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with rabbit anti-VWF antibody (A0082, DAKO, CA) overnight at 4˚C.
Plasma samples (1:40 diluted with 3% BSA in PBS) were incubated in the wells for 2 hours at room temperature.
Then, the plates were incubated with 100 μl HRP-conjugated VWF (P0226, 1:2,000; DAKO, CA) for 1 hour at room temperature.
After washing, 100 μl tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the wells.
After 15 minutes, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl 2N HCL.
Absorbance was read at 450 nm in an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad, CA).
We could not achieve satisfactory analyses for ADAMTS13 activity and VWF levels in mice brains with commercially available antibodies, and thus these analyses were precluded from the study.

Assay of VWF multimers
The VWF multimers analysis was performed as described by Xu and colleagues
Citrated plasma was diluted in sample buffer (70 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.5], containing 2.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 4% urea, and 4 mM EDTA) and was incubated at 60˚C for 20 minutes.
The sample was fractionated on a 1.2% SeaKem HGT agarose (50041, Rockland, ME) gel by electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (A10006746, Life Science, NJ).
VWF multimers were visualized using a rabbit anti-VWF antibody (A0082, DAKO, CA).
The signal was obtained using a ChemiDoc Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA).
then centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 minutes at 4˚C.
The supernatant containing soluble oligomers was stored at 4˚C.

Aβ uptake assays
hCMEC/D3 cells or astrocytes were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to confluence.
FAM-Aβ42 (100 nM) was added 2 hours after addition of rADAMTS13 (60 ng/ml, R&D Systems, LA).
After incubation for 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes (for hCMEC/D3 cells) or 30, 60, and 120 minutes (for astrocytes), cells were rinsed 3 times with cold PBS and enzymatically detached using trypsin (Gibco, MA).
Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS and then incubated with 0.2% trypan blue (Gibco, MA) in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
Uptake was measured for fluorescence on a BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences, NJ), and data were analyzed with FlowJo 10.0.8 software (FlowJo,

Aβ efflux assays
hCMEC/D3 cells or astrocytes were initially incubated with FAM-Aβ42 for 1 hour (for hCMEC/D3 cells
The medium was then removed, and cells were washed with warmed medium.
The cells were then incubated in FAM-Aβ42-free medium for 2 hours at 37˚C in the presence or absence of rADAMTS13 (60 ng/ml).
After washing, RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore, MO) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) was added to each well.
After centrifugation, protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, MA).
FAM-Aβ42 were quantified by Ultrasensitive Human ELISA Kits (KHB3544, Invitrogen, MA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Statistical analysis
All data are represented as mean ± SD.
Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software,
Two-group comparisons were evaluated using the unpaired two-tailed Student t test.
Multiple comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test.
A linear correlation between 2 variables was performed using Pearsona ˆs correlation coefficients.
Differences with P < 0.05 were considered significant.
