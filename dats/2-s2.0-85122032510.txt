Liraglutide Reduces Vascular Damage, Neuronal Loss, and Cognitive Impairment in a Mixed Murine Model of Alzheimer’s Disease and Type 2 Diabetes
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, and epidemiological studies support that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major contributor.
The relationship between both diseases and the fact that Alzheimer's disease (AD) does not have a successful treatment support the study on antidiabetic drugs limiting or slowing down brain complications in AD.
Among these, liraglutide (LRGT), a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, is currently being tested in patients with AD in the Evaluating Liraglutide in Alzheimer's Disease (ELAD) clinical trial.
However, the effects of LRGT on brain pathology when AD and T2D coexist have not been assessed.
We have administered LRGT (500 µg/kg/day) to a mixed murine model of AD and T2D (APP/PS1xdb/db mice) for 20 weeks.
We have evaluated metabolic parameters as well as the effects of LRGT on learning and memory.
Postmortem analysis included assessment of brain amyloid-β and tau pathologies, microglia activation, spontaneous bleeding and neuronal loss, as well as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors.
LRGT treatment reduced glucose levels in diabetic mice (db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db) after 4 weeks of treatment.
LRGT also helped to maintain insulin levels after 8 weeks of treatment.
While we did not detect any effects on cortical insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor m-RNA levels, LRGT significantly reduced brain atrophy in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
LRGT treatment also rescued neuron density in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice in the proximity (p = 0.008) far from amyloid plaques (p < 0.001).
LRGT reduced amyloid plaque burden in the APP/PS1 animals (p < 0.001), as well as Aβ aggregates levels (p = 0.046), and tau hyperphosphorylation (p = 0.009) in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
Spontaneous bleeding was also ameliorated in the APP/PS1xdb/db animals (p = 0.012), and microglia burden was reduced in the proximity of amyloid plaques in the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice (p < 0.001), while microglia was reduced in areas far from amyloid plaques in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice (p < 0.001).
This overall improvement helped

INTRODUCTION
Age remains the main risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Nevertheless, metabolic disorders, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) specifically, may also increase the risk of AD by over twofolds
Likewise, the close relationship between AD and T2D has been long analyzed
Studies on animal models have shown that metabolic alterations may affect different amyloid species and amyloid deposition, although the effects seem to be highly dependent on the specific animal model used
On the other hand, while it is widely accepted that cognitive dysfunction is an important and common comorbidity of diabetes, this effect does not seem to be directly related to alterations in amyloid pathology, and previous studies have reported no differences in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β (Aβ)-42 levels, global or regional AD pathology, or amyloid burden
Interestingly, a recent study using PET with 18 F-Florbetaben for global Aβ standardized value uptake ratio shows that prediabetes, but not T2D, is associated with higher Aβ levels
It has also been suggested that the inconsistent findings relating T2D to AD pathology might be due to the inclusion of heterogeneous diabetic populations and not accounting for glycemic control.
In this sense, individuals with undiagnosed diabetes have increased risk of dementia when compared with individuals with well-managed diabetes and without diabetes
In any case, T2D is a risk factor for AD even after adjusting for vascular risk factors
Even if only 10% of diabetic patients end up suffering AD later in life, the number of patients with AD in the world will double
Additionally, patients with AD have an increased risk of T2D, and up to 81% of patients with AD have T2D or impaired fasting glucose
Previous studies have shown that multiple players may underline the crosstalk between AD and T2D
Animal models have shown that metabolic alterations may affect and accelerate AD pathological features, ultimately contributing to cognitive impairment
In line with these observations, an ongoing project (Retinal and Cognitive Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes, recognized, Clinical Trials gov registration no.
NCT04281186) funded by the European Commission (H2020 program-GA 847749) is currently investigating common mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and cognitive impairment in the T2D population.
Moreover, since AD has no successful treatment and brain insulin resistance may be significantly affected; clinical trials on insulin have been carried out.
Regular insulin improves cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate AD, and is accompanied by improvements in tau-P181/Aβ42 ratio and specific brain volumes on MRI
Similarly, promising outcomes have been observed after intranasal insulin administration, such as preserved general cognition.
Exploratory analyses revealed that changes in memory and function were associated to Aβ42 levels and tau/Aβ42 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid
In line with these observations, patients with untreated diabetes present with higher phospho-and total-tau levels, higher phosphotau/Aβ42 ratios, and higher rates of progression to dementia
Other approaches have tried to improve cognitive function by targeting the activity of central glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptors
Liraglutide (LRGT), specifically, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that crosses the bloodbrain barrier
Studies that used in vitro and in vivo models show that LRGT improves AD pathological features, such as amyloid and tau pathologies, inflammation, or oxidative stress
However, to our knowledge, LRGT has not been tested on complex models that harbor both T2D and AD.
We have analyzed the long-term effects of LRGT on APP/PS1xdb/db mice, a mixed murine model with severe brain complications derived from chronic T2D and AD.
The APP/PS1xdb/db mice show brain atrophy and altered amyloid pathology when compared with APP/PS1 mice.
Increased tau phosphorylation and spontaneous bleeding are also observed in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
These complications result in early cognitive dysfunction that can be detected when T2D is established, but amyloid pathology is still scarce
Altogether, this mixed murine model reproduces a more complex version of the pathology that includes classical neuropathological features of AD and T2D.
LRGT treatment may ameliorate metabolic alterations and related vascular damage in diabetic mice while limiting amyloid and tau pathologies, inflammation, or neuronal damage associated with both AD and T2D.
Therefore, by acting at different levels, LRGT may contribute in the maintenance of cognitive status when AD and T2D coexist, as commonly observed in the clinical arena

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experimental Design: Animals and Treatments
AD-T2D mice were produced by cross-breeding APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) [Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo, stock no: 004462; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) with db/db mice (Harlan Laboratories, Boxmeer, Netherlands).
APP/PS1 presents amyloid deposition at ≈4 months of age
Since heterozygous db/db mice do not present specific metabolic or central phenotype, the animals were grouped as follows: Control (APP/PS1 -/-db/db +/+ , APP/PS1 -/-db/db ± mice), APP/PS1 (APP/PS1 ± db/db +/+ and APP/PS1 ± db/db ± mice), db/db (APP/PS1 -/-db/db -/-mice), and APP/PS1xdb/db (APP/PS1 ± db/db -/-mice) as described previously
The animals were randomly divided into groups and received LRGT as reported previously
Briefly, the mice received an initial dose of subcutaneous LRGT (25 µg/kg/day) that was increased to 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 500 µg/kg/day daily during the first week From day seven, 500 µg/kg/day (133.3 nmol/Kg/day) of LRGT was administered to the mice daily for 20 weeks.
T2D debuts at ≈6 weeks of age in db/db mice and by 26 weeks of age both AD and T2D are fully established in APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
Therefore LRGT treatment commenced at 6 weeks of age an continued up to 26 weeks of age.
Mice that did not receive LRGT received daily subcutaneous filtered PBS (vehicle).
In vivo experiments included 31-34 females and 37-40 males randomly assigned to the treatment to complete the groups (Control n = 9-10, Control-LRGT n = 9-11, APP/PS1 n = 9-10, APP/PS1-LRGT n = 10-11, db/db n = 7-9, db/db-LRGT n = 8-12, APP/PS1xdb/db n = 5-7, and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT n = 7-8).
Postmortem studies included 9-31 males and 11-26 females, depending on the assays, to complete the experimental groups (Control n = 3-8, Control-LRGT n = 3-6, APP/PS1 n = 4-8, APP/PS1-LRGT n = 4-9, db/db n = 3-7, db/db-LRGT n = 3-7, APP/PS1xdb/db n = 3-6, and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT n = 3-6).
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Cadiz in accordance with the Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals (European Commission Directive 2010/63/UE and Spanish Royal Decree 53/2013).

Metabolic Determination
Body weight, non-fasting blood glucose levels, and plasma insulin levels were determined before the commencement of the treatment and every 4 weeks until sacrifice at 26 weeks.
Blood glucose levels were measured from nicked tails using the glucometer Optium Xceed (Abbott, London, United Kingdom).
For plasma insulin determination, blood was collected from the tail vein and placed in tubes with potassium-EDTA (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany).
Blood samples were centrifuged for 7 min, 6,500 rpm at 4 • C, and plasma fraction was stored at -80 • C until it was processed.
Plasma insulin levels were measured using an ultrasensitive mouse enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Mercodia Inc., Winston-Salem, NC, USA).

Morris Water Maze
Behavioral assessment commenced after 18 weeks of treatment with LRGT.
The acquisition phase was assessed 12 days prior to sacrifice.
The pool was a round tank of 90 cm in diameter and water temperature was 21 ± 2 • C. The animals performed four trials/day for 4 days, with the platform submerged in quadrant 2. Swimming commenced in each of the four virtual quadrants that the pool was divided in.
Time limit was 60 s/trial, with a 10-min intertrial interval.
If an animal did not find the platform, it was placed on the platform for 10 s.
The retention phase started 24 h after the acquisition phase was completed, and it consisted of a single trial with the platform removed.
Time required to locate the platform in the acquisition phase, percentage of time spent in quadrant 2 during the retention phase, and swim speed were analyzed using the Smart software (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain).

Actimetry and New Object Discrimination Task
Spontaneous motor activity test commenced the day after completion of the MWM.
The mice were placed in a rectangular box (length 44 cm × width 22 cm × height 40 cm), and the distance traveled for 30 min was recorded.
The new object discrimination test commenced the next day, as described previously
The animals were exposed to two objects, for habituation purposes, that were not used again during the object exploration task.
On day 3, each mouse performed two sample trials and a test trial.
On the first sample trial, the mice were allowed to explore for 5 min four copies of a novel object (navy balls) arranged in a triangle-shaped spatial configuration.
After a 30min delay, the mice performed a second sample trial with four novel objects (red cones) arranged in a quadratic-shaped spatial configuration, for 5 min.
After 30 min, the mice performed a test trial with two copies of the object from sample trial 2 ("recent" objects) placed in the same position, and two copies of the object from sample trial 1 ("familiar" objects), with one placed in the same position ("old non-displaced" object) and the other in a new position ("familiar displaced" object).
Integrated episodic memory for "what, " "where, " and "when" paradigms was analyzed as described previously
"What" was defined as the difference in time exploring familiar and recent objects, "where" was defined as the difference in time exploring displaced and non-displaced objects, and "when" was defined as the difference between time exploring familiar non-displaced objects and time exploring recent non-displaced objects.

Rotarod
Motor coordination was assessed by the rotarod (Panlab Harvard Apparatus, Barcelona, Spain).
An animal was placed on a horizontal rod (3 cm in diameter and 5.7 cm wide), which is rotated around its longitudinal axis, and the animal must walk forward to remain upright and not fall off (the height to fall is 16 cm).
The animals were placed on the rod for 4 min at 4 revolutions per minute (rpm) for training purposes.
During the test, the speed was increased from 4 to 40 rpm within 1 min.
The time spent on the rod and the velocity when the animals fall was recorded.

Tissue Processing and Cresyl Violet Staining
The animals were sacrificed by intraperitoneal pentobarbital overdose (120 mg/kg).
Brains were immediately harvested and weighed.
Right hemispheres were dissected and frozen at -80 • C until they were used.
Left hemispheres were fixed in PFA 4%, and 30-µm coronal sections were obtained with cryostat (Microm HM 525; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain).
Six sections located at 1.5, 0.5, -0.5, -1.5, -2.5, and -3.5 from Bregma,
Briefly, the sections were dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 15 min and then incubated in a cresyl violet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution (0.5% w/v) for 10 min.
After washing, tissue was fixed in 0.25% acetic acid in ethanol for 5 min, and subsequently in 100% ethanol and xylene for 2 min.
The sections were mounted with DPX (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Images were acquired with an optical Olympus Bx60 microscope with an Olympus DP71 camera.
Cell F (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany), Adobe Photoshop Elements and Image J software were used to process the images and measure cortex and hippocampus sizes.

Prussian Blue Staining
Sections contiguous to those used for cresyl violet staining were incubated by Prussian blue iron staining and neutral red counterstaining as described previously
Images were acquired with an Olympus Bx60 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) microscope with an Olympus DP71 camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to assess the complete cortex and hippocampus.
The images were analyzed using the Image J software to quantify hemorrhage burden in the cortex and hippocampus.

NeuN/DAPI Staining
Six sections located at 1.5, 0.5, -0.5, -1.5, -2.5, and -3.5 from Bregma were selected and blocked with BSA 3% and Triton X-100 0.5% during 1 h.
Thereafter, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 • C with anti-NeuN (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (Ref.
MAB377) (1:200).
Alexa Fluor donkey anti-mouse 594 was used as secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) (Ref.
A21203) (1:1,000), followed by DAPI 1 mg/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (Ref.
D9542) (1:3,000) counterstain for 1 h.
Amyloid plaques were stained with thioflavin S (TS) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (Ref.
T1892) (0.01%) in H 2 O/ethanol (1:1) for 10 min.
The sections were mounted and photographed using an Olympus Bx60 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) microscope with an Olympus DP71 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) camera.
The percentage of NeuN-positive cells (normalized by total cells stained with DAPI) was quantified in the cortex, close (<50 µm from plaque border) and far (>50 µm) from amyloid plaques using the Image J software

Axonal Immunostaining
Axonal curvature was analyzed after immunostaining with an SMI-312 antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) Ref. 837904) (1:1,000) as described
Briefly, six sections 1 mm apart were pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide 3% and Triton X-100.5% for 20 min and blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h.
Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse 594 was used as secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, USA) (Ref.
A11005) (1:200) for 1 h.
Amyloid plaques were visualized with TS as described above.
Micrographs of stained tissue were obtained with a Laser Olympus U-RFL-T (Olympus, Japan) fluorescent microscope and the MMIcellTools software.
The Image J software was used for analysis purposes.
Axon curvature ratio was calculated by dividing the end-to-end distance of a dendrite segment by the total length between the two segment ends.
The distance to the closest amyloid plaque was measured at three points along each neurite, and the average distance was determined from these three measurements
At least 40 neurites were analyzed in each animal to complete 309-939 neurites/group.
Curvatures were pooled in the proximity of amyloid plaques (up to 50 µm from the border), and neurites analyzed further from amyloid plaques borders were considered in SP-free areas.
In the Control and db/db animals, axon curvature was compared with those measured in the APP/PS1 mice further than 50 µm from SP, as described previously

Aβ and Microglia Immunostaining
PFA-fixed 30-µm sections were pre-treated with 70% formic acid for 10 min and blocked in 3% BSA and 0.5% Triton-X100 for 1 h.
The sections were incubated with anti-Iba1 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) (Ref.
(1:1,000) and 4G8 (Biolegend, London, United Kingdom) (Ref.
800702) (1:2,000), antibodies overnight at 4 • C in 0.5% BSA followed by secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor donkey anti-rabbit 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) (Ref.
A21206) and Alexa Fluor donkey anti-mouse 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) (Ref.
A21203) (1:1,000) for 2 h.
Images were acquired using a Laser Olympus U-RFL-T (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) fluorescent microscope and the MMIcellTools software.
Microglia burden (% covered area) in the cortex and hippocampus was also analyzed in the proximity of (<50 µm) and far (>50 µm) from amyloid plaques in the case of the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice, and in random selected areas in mice without amyloid plaques (Control and db/db), as described previously
The Image J software was used to analyze the number, size, and burden of Aβ deposits in the cortex and hippocampus.

Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ Aggregates Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Soluble and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified in the cortex and hippocampus with colorimetric ELISA kits (Wako, Osaka, Japan) (Aβ40,
Tissue (5-10 mg) was homogenized in 50 µl of Pierce TM IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
87788) with Halt TM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
78440) phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail and centrifuged (14,500 rpm) for 12 min at 4 • C. Soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were measured in supernatants.
The resultant pellet was extracted with 50 µl of 70% formic acid and centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 10 min.
Insoluble fraction was neutralized and diluted 1:30 with 1M Tris (pH 11).
Human Aβ40 and Aβ42 provided in the kit were used for standard curves.
Aβ aggregates were quantified using Human Amyloid β (82E1-specific) Aβ Oligomers Assay Kit (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) (Ref.
27725).
The cortex was homogenized (1/5 w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) containing Halt TM phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail.
Homogenates were then centrifuged (14,500 rpm) for 60 min at 4 • C. The supernatant was collected and diluted 1:2 with EIA buffer provided in the kit.
All absorbances were measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm (MQX200R2; Biotek Instruments, Burlington, VT, USA), and data were expressed as pmol/g tissue.

Total-Tau and Phospho-Tau Levels
Total tau and tau phosphorylation levels were measured in cortical and hippocampal samples as described previously
Tissue was homogenized in Pierce TM IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
87788) with Halt TM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
78440) phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail.
The homogenates were sonicated and centrifuged at 4 • C for 5 min at 15,000 g.
Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
5000006).
Proteins were separated on 10% acrylamide-bisacrylamide gels, followed by electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
1620177).
Membranes were then immersed in blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
WB7050) for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 • C with mouse anti-phospho-tau antibody (1:1,000) (clon AT8) Thermo Fisher Scientific, Agawan, MA, USA) (Ref.
MN1020) (1:1,000).
Membranes were washed and then incubated with Secondary Antibody Solution Alk-Phos.
Conjugated (Anti-Mouse) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
10013103), and a chemiluminescent inmunodetection system for mouse and rabbit primary antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The membranes were washed, and signal was detected using Novex AP Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madrid, Spain) (Ref.
WP20002) in a ChemiDoc MP (Biorad, Madrid, Spain) imager.
After stripping, the membranes were incubated with anti-total tau (1:1,000) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) following the above procedure.
Optical density was semi-quantified after normalizing to β-actin (Sigma, OR, USA) (Ref.
A5441) (1:1,000) using the Image J software.
Phospho-tau/total tau ratios were represented as percentage of control values.

IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-1R mRNA Expression
For rt-qPCR analysis, RNA was isolated from the cortex using TRIzol TM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Ref.
15596026) following the instructions of the manufacturer and resuspended in purified nuclease-free water.
The RNA was quantified using a BioTek Synergy TM Mx (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) fluorometer.
Complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained from 500-ng RNA using iScript TM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) (Ref.1708890) on Techne Genius Thermal Cycler (Techne Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom).
The 15-µl RT-qPCR reaction mix contained 7.5 µl 2X iTaq TM Universal SYBR R Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) (Ref.
1725122) 200 nmol (for IR-varA, IR-varB, and rRNA18S) or 900 nmol (for IGF-I) of forward and reverse primers, and 1 µl of the sample.
The PCR thermal profile included 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 • C for 10 s, annealing at temperature according to each set of primers (61 • C for IR-varA, 59 • C for IR-varB, 64 • C for IGF-I, and 55 • C for rRNA18S) for 15 s, and extension at 72 • C for 20 s, followed by melting curve analysis.
Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and 6-9 mice per group were included in the study.
The mRNA level of rRNA18S was used as internal control.
Relative quantification values of mRNA expression were calculated as 2-Ct with the comparative Ct method.
First, internal control Ct values were subtracted from the gene-of-interest Ct values to derive a CT value.
The relative expression of the gene of interest was then evaluated using the expression 2-Ct, where the value for Ct was obtained by subtracting the Ct of the calibrator from each CT, using the mean of the control (Control animals) as the calibrator.
The oligonucleotide primers used in this study were designed by BLAST and were obtained from Merck KGaA (Madrid, Spain) for IR-varA (FW:TTTGTCCCCAGGCCATCC-RV:ATCTGGAAGTGTGAGTGTGG), IR-varB (FW:AATGGTG CCGAGGACAGTA-RV:ATCTGGAAGTGTGAGTGTGG) and IGF-I (FW:CACAACTACTGCTCCAAAGACAAA-RV:TTTTC CGTCACCTCCTCCAC); rRNA18S (FW:CTCAACACGGGAA ACCTCAC-RV:CTCAACACGGGAAACCTCAC).

Statistical Analysis
One-way ANOVA for independent samples, followed by Tukey's b or Tamhane test, was performed when all the eight groups under study were compared.
One-way ANOVA was also performed when only treated and untreated APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice were analyzed (Aβ levels, amyloid plaques, microglia, and neuronal curvature close to amyloid plaques).
Two-way ANOVA (groupXday) was performed to analyze the acquisition phase in the MWM test.
The SPSS v.24 software was used for all the statistical analyses.
One-way ANOVA for independent samples was performed for further analysis of individual days during acquisition in the MWM.
Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

RESULTS

Liraglutide Reduces Metabolic Alterations in T2D and AD-T2D Mice
When we analyzed glucose level evolution along treatment, we did not detect a significant groupXweek effect by twoway ANOVA for independent samples [F (35 , 380) = 1.18, p = 0.227].
However, further assessment of individual days revealed that the LRGT treatment reduced glucose levels in diabetic mice (Figure
On week 6, in baseline untreated animals, plasma glucose in the db/db mice and APP/PS1xdb/db crosses were significantly increased compared with the Control and APP/PS1 mice.
This increase in non-fasting glucose levels was more severe in the APP/PS1xdb/db animals (p < 0.001).
By 10 weeks of age, glucose levels were significantly higher in the untreated db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the LRGT-treated and untreated Control and APP/PS1xdb/db mice (p < 0.01).
Differences in glucose levels between the untreated diabetic (db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice) and nondiabetic mice were maintained up to week 26 (p < 0.01).
The LRGT treatment helped in limiting hyperglucemia in the db/db mice, and glucose levels reached control values by week 10 (after 4 weeks of LRGT treatment).
Similarly, LRGT reduced non-fasting glucose levels in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the untreated APP/SP1xdb/db animals by 10 weeks of age, and a similar profile was observed by 14 weeks of age.
By 18 weeks, glucose levels in the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice were similar to those detected in the Control and APP/PS1 animals.
Glycemic control was maintained in the db/db-LRGT and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice until the end of treatment (26 weeks of age).
When we analyzed insulin levels, we detected a significant groupXweek effect by two-way ANOVA for independent samples along treatment [F (35 , 384) = 2.64, p < 0.01].
Further differences were observed among the groups when we analyzed individual weeks (Figure
On week 6, basal insulin levels in untreated animals were increased in the db/db mice, although differences with the Control and APP/PS1 animals only reached statistical significance in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice (p < 0.01).
The fact that insulin levels were significantly increased in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice suggests an earlier metabolic compromise in the crossed model that requires an increase in pancreatic activity.
By 10 weeks of age, statistical differences were observed in the db/db-LRGT and APP/PSxdb/db-LRGT mice when compared with the non-diabetic animals (Control and APP/PS1), suggesting an increase in insulin production in the LRGT-treated mice that allows for better glycemic control (p < 0.01).
This situation was maintained from 14 to 26 weeks of age, and LRGT helped to increase insulin levels in the diabetic mice (db/db-LRGT and APP/PS1xb/db-LRGT) to control hyperglycemia.
We also detected a significant groupXweek effect by twoway ANOVA for independent samples [F (35 , 400) = 3.13, * * p < 0.01] when we analyzed body weight.
Further assessment of individual weeks revealed that the LRGT treatment helped maintain body weight in cachectic APP/PS1xdb/db mice, as shown previously
By week 6 at baseline, the untreated diabetic mice (db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db) were overweight when compared with the non-diabetic mice (Control and APP/PS1) (p < 0.01).
By week 10, all the diabetic mice, treated and untreated, presented significantly higher body weight when compared with the Control and APP/PS1 animals (p < 0.01), and these differences were maintained up to week 18 (p < 0.01).
By week 22, the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db mice were still overweight when compared with the Control and APP/PS1 animals (p < 0.01); however, a slight reduction in body weight could be detected, indicative of a cachectic state, as described previously
Nevertheless, LRGT helped in maintaining the body weight of the APP/PS1xd/db mice, avoiding weight loss from week 22 until the end of the study (26 weeks).
Importantly, the LRGT treatment counterbalanced this situation, and the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice performed like the Control mice in both paradigms.

Liraglutide Improves Cognitive
We did not detect a significant groupXday effect by two-way ANOVA for independent samples [F (21 , 1113) = 0.985, p = 0.479] when spatial memory was analyzed in the acquisition phase of the MWM.
However, individual day assessment revealed that cognitive impairment in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice was significantly ameliorated by the LRGT treatment (Figure
On day 1 of the acquisition phase, the APP/PS1xdb/db mice were already compromised when compared with the Control, Control-LRGT, APP/PS1, APP/PS1-LRGT, db/db, and db/db-LRGT mice (p < 0.01).
This compromise was also observed on acquisition days 2-4 for the naïve APP/PS1xdb/db mice and db/db animals when compared with the LRGT-treated and untreated non-diabetic mice (Control and APP/PS1).
An improvement was observed in diabetic mice after the LRGT treatment, although the times to locate the platform were still longer than those observed in the Control and Control-LRGT mice (Figure
In the retention phase of the MWM, we observed that the APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compromised and spent significantly shorter times in the quadrant where the platform used to be located when compared with the Control mice (p = 0.02).
However, after the LRGT treatment, differences were no longer observed between the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT and Control mice (Figure
We also analyzed motor activity by assessing different paradigms.
When we analyzed the distance traveled in the open field, we observed that the diabetic mice (db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db) traveled shorter distances than the non-diabetic animals, although no statistical differences were observed among the groups under study (Table
Swimming speed in the MWM was also used to characterize motor alterations in all the groups under study (Table
As observed previously, in the diabetic mice (db/db and APP/PS1xd/db mice), swimming speeds were lower than those detected in the Control and APP/PS1 animals (p < 0.01).
Similar differences between diabetic and non-diabetic mice were observed when motor activity was analyzed by time (p < 0.01) or maximum speed (p < 0.01) in the rotarod test (Table
However, no differences were observed in any of the paradigms (distance traveled in the open field, swimming speed in the MWR, and rotarod) when the db/db-LRGT or the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice were compared with the untreated db/db or the APP/PS1xdb/db animals, suggesting that the observed improvement in learning and memory is not due to changes in motor activity.

Liraglutide Limits Brain Atrophy and Neuronal Loss
Severe brain atrophy was detected in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice as described previously
Brain weight was comparable between controls and APP/PS1 mice receiving vehicle, whereas the brain weight of vehicle-treated db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice was significantly reduced.
On the other hand, LGRT-treated db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db brain weight was comparable with that of the vehicle and LGRT-treated controls and APP/PS1 mice (Figure
Further assessment of brain structures revealed that cortical size was significantly reduced in the db/db and APP/PSxdb/db mice when compared with the untreated Control and APP/PS1xdb/db animals (p < 0.01).
Nevertheless, the LRGT treatment significantly improved this situation in the diabetic animals, and cortical size in db/db-LRGT and APP/PS1xd/db-LRGT was comparable with that of the vehicle-and LRGT-treated controls and APP/PS1 mice (Figures
Differences did not reach statistical significance in the hippocampus (Figure
We observed that neuronal density in the cortex was significantly reduced in the proximity of amyloid plaques when the APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compared with the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1-LRGT treated animals, while the LRGT-treated APP/PS1xdb/db mice presented values similar to those detected in the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1-LRGT mice (Figures
In cortical areas far from amyloid plaques, we detected a significant compromise in the untreated APP/PS1 and db/db mice when compared with the Control and Control-LRGT mice (p < 0.01).
This effect was more severe in the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db mice, and the LRGT treatment contributed to improve NeuN/DAPI ratio in this group, reaching statistical significance when the APP/PS1xdb/db and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice were compared (Figures
The number of plaques in the hippocampus was low at 6 months of age, and in areas far from amyloid plaques, we observed that LRGT also helped in maintaining neuronal density (Figure
In the untreated db/db mice, we observed that NeuN/DAPI ratios were significantly lower than those measured in the LRGT-treated and untreated Control and APP/PS1 animals (p < 0.01).
The APP/PS1xdb/db mice showed a more severe reduction in NeuN/DAPI ratio that was statistically significant when compared with the LRGT-treated and untreated Control, APP/PS1, and db/db animals.
The LRGT treatment improved NeuN/DAPI ratios in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1xdb/db mice, although they did not reach Control or APP/PS1 values (Figure

Neuronal Curvature Is Reduced After Liraglutide Treatment
Curvature ratio was increased in the proximity of amyloid plaques when the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db animals were compared with the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1-LRGT mice (p = 0.04).
On the other hand, the LRGT treatment significantly improved neuronal curvature ratio in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db mice (p = 0.004) (
A similar profile was observed in areas free from amyloid plaques when all the groups under study were compared (Figures
The LRGT treatment helped in limiting this situation, and while neuronal curvature in the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice did not reach Control values, a significant straightening effect was observed when the treated APP/PS1xdb/db mice where compared with the naïve animals (p < 0.01) (Figure

Liraglutide Reduces Aβ Pathology
As described previously, amyloid plaque burden is lower in the cortex from the APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the APP/PS1 animals
TS staining showed that amyloid plaque burden was significantly higher in the APP/PS1 mice than in the APP/PS1xdb/db animals (p < 0.001).
The LRGT treatment contributed in reducing amyloid plaque burden in the APP/PS1 animals (p < 0.001), whereas differences did not reach statistical significance when the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compared with the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice (Figures
A similar profile was observed after 4G8 immunostaining, and differences reached statistical significance when the APP/PS1 mice were compared with the APP/PS1xdb/db and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice.
No differences were observed among the groups when we assessed amyloid plaque burden in the hippocampus (Figure
TS staining also revealed that the LRGT treatment reduced amyloid plaque size in the cortex from the APP/PS1 and APP/S1xdb/db mice when compared with the untreated animals (p < 0.01) (Figure
We also observed that the LRGT treatment reduced 4G8-labeled plaques in the APP/PS1 and APP/PSxdb/db mice (Figure
Amyloid plaque size was not significantly affected in the hippocampus when the treated and untreated APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compared (Figure
Soluble Aβ is slightly favored in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the APP/PS1 mice
While we observed this profile, differences did not reach statistical significance when the LRGT-treated and untreated APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compared.
Similar outcomes were detected when soluble Aβ42 levels were analyzed (Figure
The LRGT treatment significantly reduced Aβ aggregates in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the untreated animals (p = 0.046) (Figure
Soluble Aβ42 levels were not affected in the hippocampus when all the four groups (APP/PS1, APP/PS-LRGT, APP/PS1xdb/db, and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT) were compared (Figure
Insoluble Aβ40 (p = 0.026) and Aβ42 (p = 0.011) levels were reduced in untreated APP/PS1xdb/db when compared with the untreated APP/PS1 animals.
Differences did not reach statistical significance when the APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compared with the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT animals (Figure
Differences did not reach statistical significance when insoluble Aβ40 or Aβ42 levels were compared in the hippocampus (Figure

Liraglutide Limits Tau Pathology
We observed an increase in cortical tau phosphorylation in the db/db animals, although differences only reached statistical significance when the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db mice were compared with the Control animals (p = 0.009).
LRGT reduced phospho-tau/total tau ratio in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice, and differences were no longer observed when the APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT mice were compared with the Control animals (Figures
Likewise, we also detected an increase in hippocampal tau phosphorylation in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
While the LRGT treatment seemed to counterbalance this situation, no statistical differences were detected among any of the groups under study (Figure

Liraglutide Reduces Spontaneous Bleeding in APP/PS1xdb/db Mice
As described previously, hemorrhage burden in the cortex was significantly increased in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the naïve Control and APP/PS1 animals (p = 0.012).
Interestingly, the LRGT treatment reduced hemorrhage burden in the cortex from the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with untreated animals of these genotypes.
Cortical hemorrhage density was also significantly higher in the db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db mice than in the Control and APP/SP1 animals, and LRGT successfully limited hemorrhage density in the diabetic animals (p < 0.001) (Figures
We did not observe significant differences among the groups when hemorrhage burden and density were analyzed in the hippocampus (Figure

Liraglutide Limits Microglia Activation in APP/PS1xdb/db Mice
Cortical microglia burden was significantly lower in the close proximity of amyloid plaques in APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.001), and the LRGT treatment reduced microglia burden both in the APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db mice when compared with the untreated APP/PS1 and APP/PS1xdb/db groups (Figures
On the other hand, microglia burden was significantly higher in the untreated APP/PS1xdb/db mice than in the untreated Control, APP/PS1, and db/db mice in areas with no amyloid plaques (p < 0.001).
The LRGT treatment reduced microglia burden in the db/db mice, and more robust differences were observed in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice after the LRGT treatment (p < 0.001).
Differences did not reach statistical significance in the hippocampus when microglia burden in the proximity or far from the amyloid plaques (Figure

Liraglutide Has No Effect on mRNA Expression of IR-A, IR-B, or IGF-1R
When we analyzed IR-A mRNA expression, we did not observe any differences in the cortex from any of the groups under study (Figure
Similar outcomes were observed for IR-B or IGF-1R (Figure

DISCUSSION
Patients with AD are in tremendous need of new therapeutic opportunities
The close relationship between T2D and AD
GLP-1 analogs reduce amyloid and tau pathologies, inflammation, and cognitive impairment in different models
Also, preliminary studies on humans show that LRGT might be neuroprotective in individuals at risk of AD, improving intrinsic connectivity within default mode network in the brain
Moreover, the ELAD trial is currently assessing the effect of LRGT on patients with AD
However, as far as we know, no studies have analyzed the role of LRGT in complex models that harbor both AD and T2D, as regularly seen in the clinical arena.
Therefore, FIGURE 4 | differences were observed when soluble Aβ40 or Aβ42 levels were analyzed in the cortex.
However, Aβ aggregates were significantly reduced in APP/PS1xdb/db mice on LRGT treatment ( †p = 0.046 vs. APP/PS1xdb/db).
No statistical differences were observed in the hippocampus for soluble Aβ40 or Aβ42 levels.
Insoluble Aβ40 ( ‡p = 0.026 vs. APP/PS1) and Aβ42 ( ‡p = 0.011 vs. APP/PS1) levels are reduced in APP/PS1xdb/db when compared with APP/PS1 animals, and LRGT treatment contributes to further reductions in the cortex.
No differences were observed in the hippocampus for insoluble Aβ40 or Aβ42.
Data are representative of 6-9 animals.
(D) Tau phosphorylation was reduced in the cortex after LRGT treatment ( † † p = 0.009 vs. Control).
Differences did not reach statistical significance in the hippocampus.
Data are representative of 3-11 mice.
(E) Illustrative example of Western blot for phospho-tau, total tau, and β-actin in the cortex from all the groups studied.
we have analyzed the effects of long-term LRGT treatment in APP/PS1xdb/db mice, a mixed murine model that reproduces severe brain complications associated with T2D and AD
In our opinion, LRGT helps in maintaining body weight, in line with previous studies showing that antidiabetic treatments may limit body weight loss in cachectic diabetic mice
The LRGT treatment could also help in lowering glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion in diabetic mice (db/db and APP/PS1xdb/db) in the long term, as described previously
We also observed that brain atrophy in diabetic animals was significantly reduced by long-term LRGT treatment.
We specifically assessed the cortex, as this region is preferentially affected in APP/PS1xdb/db mice
The LRGT treatment maintained cortical size and thickness in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
On the other hand, we did not detect significant differences in the hippocampus, in line with previous studies showing that this region is affected later in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice
Further assessment of NeuN/DAPI ratio also revealed that LRGT helps in maintaining neuron population in the long term.
We also observed that LRGT reduced neuronal curvature, indicating an overall improvement in neuronal wellness, as reported previously, postmortem
Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors are mainly expressed in β-pancreatic cells and the gastrointestinal system, although they are also found in the brain
GLP-1, as a growth factor, increases cell growth and proliferation, and it also reduces neuronal injury and hippocampal apoptosis
Moreover, GLP-1 analogs induce cell proliferation and differentiation, and stimulate neurite growth
Similarly, the neuroprotective role of LRGT has been largely assessed in models has been shown to have a capacity to prevent synapse loss and deterioration of synaptic plasticity in AD
Other studies have also shown that LRGT enhances insulin sensitivity and improves insulin resistance
Insulin resistance is not only a feature of diabetes pathology, but it is also an early alteration in AD, associated with basal elevations of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylated in serine 616
Besides, serine phosphorylation of IRS1 is common in both AD and diabetes
Similarly, LRGT significantly decreases IR aberrations in the APP/PS1 mice
In our experiments, IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-1R mRNA expression levels were not significantly affected in APP/PS1xdb/db mice.
While alterations at this level have been reported as a feasible link between AD and T2D
Liraglutide reduces tau hyperphosphorylation in both AD
While tau pathology is limited in the APP/PS1 mice, we observed a slight increase in tau phosphorylation both in the APP/PS1 and in db/db mice.
Tau phosphorylation is significantly increased in the APP/PS1xdb/db animals, showing a synergistic effect when AD and T2D are set together
Interestingly, early tau alterations, and not necessarily neurofibrillary tangles, might be critical for cognitive malfunctions
We observed that the LRGT treatment reduces tau phosphorylation, as reported previously in AD models
On the other hand, the role of LRGT on amyloid pathology remains controversial, and previous studies have reported that LRGT has no effect on amyloid plaque burden in AD animals
Our results are in line with observations reporting a reduction in amyloid pathology after LRGT treatment, such as significant reduction in the number of amyloid plaques
LRGT also reverses amyloid plaque deposition
While the burden of amyloid plaques in the APP/PS1xdb/db mice is lower than in the APP/PS1 animals
This is accompanied by a FIGURE 5 | Spontaneous bleeding and inflammation are reduced after LRGT treatment while IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-1R mRNA expression is not affected.
Prussian blue staining is used to quantify hemorrhage burden and density in the cortex from untreated and treated mice (LRGT, 500 µg/kg/day) (A,B).
Microglia burden was quantified by Iba1 immunostaining in the proximity of (<50 µm) and far (>50 µm) from amyloid plaques in untreated and LRGT-treated animals (C,D).
IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-1R mRNA expression is also determined in the cortex from untreated and LRGT-treated mice (E) (complete statistical analysis included as a Supplementary Material).
(A) LRGT treatment reduces hemorrhage burden in the cortex ( † p = 0.012 vs. Control, Control-LRGT, APP/PS1, APP/PS1-LRGT, db/db-LRGT, and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT).
A similar profile was observed when we analyzed cortical hemorrhage density ( † † p < 0.001 vs. Control, Control-LRGT, APP/PS1, db/db-LRGT, and APP/PS1xdb/db-LRGT).
No differences were detected in the hippocampus when hemorrhage burden or density was analyzed.
Data are representative of 3-5 mice (489-1,012 hemorrhages/group).
slight reduction in Aβ levels, which is in line with prior studies on 3×Tg AD mice
We also detected a significant reduction in Aβ aggregates in the APP/PS1xdb/db animals, as reported previously, in the APP/PS1 mice
Given the relevance Aβ pathology in AD, further studies would be required to fully characterize Aβ structures and to provide a full picture of changes observed when AD and T2D coexist, as well as after LRGT treatment.
The anti-inflammatory properties of LRGT may also contribute to its neuroprotective effects
LRGT successfully reduced microglia activation in the proximity of amyloid plaques and in amyloid-free areas, showing a beneficial effect in both AD and T2D mice.
The AD-T2D animals show an increase in microglia burden, mostly in areas free of amyloid plaques
The inflammatory response seems to be significantly disrupted when AD and T2D coexist, and metabolic disease cooperates to enhance the profiles of cytokines involved in neuronal injury, amyloid and tau pathologies, or blood-brain barrier damage
In this sense, the db/db and, more severely, the APP/PS1xdb/db mice present small vessel disease that significantly improved after LRGT treatment.
LRGT has positive effects on the peripheral vasculature
It also increases microvessel density and endothelial cell proliferation, reducing infarct brain volume after focal cortical ischemia
Spatial learning and memory improved after LRTG treatment in the MWM.
Episodic memory was also enhanced in the new object discrimination test.
Studies on patients show that episodic memory is affected early in AD
Likewise, in patients with T2D-mild cognitive impairment, episodic memory correlated with glycated hemoglobin levels
Our observations are in line with previous studies on AD models
Clinical studies on the effects of LRGT on cognition are limited and controversial in some cases (for review
Nevertheless, positive effects of LRTG and other GLP-1 analogs have been reported in prediabetic and diabetic patients
Similarly, positive effects have been reported on patients with early AD and amnesic mild cognitive impairment
Our results support a positive role for LRGT at central level when AD and T2D coexist, as usually observed in the clinic
Brain atrophy, vascular damage, amyloid pathology, brain inflammation, and cognitive impairment are significantly ameliorated, supporting the beneficial role of LRGT in the brain and clinical studies on patients with AD.
