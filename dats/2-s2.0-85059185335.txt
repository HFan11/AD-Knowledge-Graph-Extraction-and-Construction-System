Impact of CSF storage volume on the analysis of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers on an automated platform
Objectives: To assess the potential influence of the ratio between the storage tube surface area and the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (surface/volume) on the quantifications of four Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers on the Lumipulse G600II automated platform.
Methods: CSF samples of 10 consecutive patients were stored in 2 ml polypropylene tubes containing four dif-ferent CSF volumes: 1.5 ml, 1 ml, 0.5 ml and 0.25 ml.
Concentration of CSF Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, t-Tau and p-Tau were measured in all aliquots using the LUM IPULSE G600II automated platform from Fujirebio.
Results: Levels of CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 were lower in samples stored with lower volumes (higher surface/volume ratios).
This decrease was partly compensated by using the ratio Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40.
Quantification of t-Tau and p-Tau were not influenced by this pre-analytical condition.
The surface/volume ratio can potentially influence the results of amyloid AD biomarkers.
It appears essential to take into account the surface/volume ratio of the storage tubes when quantifying CSF biomarkers in clinical routine.

Introduction
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, in particular two amyloid peptides (Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40), and total Tau (t-Tau) and 181-phosho-Tau (p-Tau), play a major role in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD).
Numerous studies have shown a characteristic CSF biomarker pattern in AD that consists of a decrease of Aβ1-42 and the ratio Aβ1-42/Aβ-40 and an increase of t-Tau and p-Tau
Experimental data have shown that pre-analytical conditions, such as the nature of the collection tube or the storage conditions among others, strongly influence the biomarker values and eventually can lead to misdiagnosis of AD
Investigational studies have also established that the volume of CSF in storage tubes has an impact on the values of Aβ1-42 peptides
Thus, intense efforts have ultimately been developed to standardize pre-analytical treatment of human CSF samples in order to allow a wider clinical implementation of AD biomarkers for diagnosis in clinical practice and clinical trials
This increase in precision has also allowed a better characterization of the effect of some confounding pre-analytical factors that may not have been previously detected using conventional ELISA techniques.
In the present study, we investigated the potential influence that the ratio between the storage tube surface area and the CSF volume (surface/volume) may have on the simultaneous quantification of four AD biomarkers (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, t-Tau and p-Tau) in the Lumipulse G600II automated platform.

Methods
CSF samples were obtained from 10 consecutive patients that underwent lumbar puncture for the analysis of CSF AD biomarkers at the Sant Pau Memory Unit in July 2018.
All participants gave their written consent to participate in our CSF biomarker program.
All CSF samples were collected in 10 ml polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Ref. 62.610.018),
under standardized conditions
Immediately after centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min at 4 °C, CSF volumes of 1.5 ml, 1 ml, 0.5 ml and 0.25 ml of each sample were aliquoted in 2 ml polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Ref. 72.694.007).
Collection tubes and storage tubes were not pre-treated before their use.
Total processing time (from lumbar puncture to storage) was less than 2 h in all cases.
All aliquots were stored at -80 °C until analyses, and total storage time was less than four weeks in all cases.
On day of the analysis, samples were thawed at room temperature and the tubes were vortexed to avoid freeze-thaw gradients.
Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, t-Tau and p-Tau were quantified in this order directly in the storage tubes using the LUMIPULSE G600II automated platform.
All samples were processed using the same batch of kits and reagents, and all aliquots obtained from the same patient were processed in the same run of analysis to avoid run-to-run variability.
Key performance characteristics of the assays are summarized in Supplementary Table
Biomarker measures were transformed to percentages relative to their measure in the aliquot containing 1.5 ml (reference sample, 100%).
We applied linear models to quantify the effect of the surface/ volume ratio (factor) on the relative levels of biomarkers (dependent variable).
The absolute levels of biomarkers were introduced as covariates.
Level of significance was set at α = 0.05 for all analyses.

Results
Table
Levels of biomarker quantifications ranged from 517 to 3490 pg/ ml for Aβ1-42, 8264 to 21,164 pg/ml for Aβ1-40, 204 to 1011 pg/ml for t-Tau and 29 to 190 pg/ml for p-Tau.

Table
Our data show that the surface/volume ratio significantly influenced Aβ1-42 quantification (Fig.

(95%CI 11-20%, p < .001)
and 21% (95%CI 16-26%, p < .001)
lower than those in the reference sample (1.5 ml), respectively.
A similar pattern, although to a lesser extent, was observed for Aβ1-40 (Fig.
Levels of Aβ1-40 measured in tubes with 1 ml, 0.5 ml and 0.25 ml of CSF were 4% (95%CI 0-7%, p = .06),
8% (95%CI 4-12%, p < .001)
and 10% (95%CI 7-14%, p < .001)
lower than those in the reference sample, respectively.
The use of the Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio could partly compensate these discrepancies (Fig.
The ratios measured in tubes with 0.5 ml and 0.25 ml of CSF were 8% (95%CI 4-12%, p < .001)
and 12% (95%CI 8-16%, p < .001)
lower than in those in the reference sample, respectively.
The ratios measured in tubes with 1 ml were not significantly different than those in the reference sample (95%CI -1-7%, p = .11).
Next, we tested whether a similar effect was detectable when measuring tau proteins.
As displayed in Fig.
The levels of t-Tau and p-Tau measured in tubes with 1 ml, 0.5 ml and 0.25 ml of CSF were not significantly different than those in the reference sample (only a trend was observed in the 0.25 ml sample compared to reference sample).

Discussion
Our work illustrates that lower surface/volume ratios are associated with a decrease in the quantification of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 levels on the Lumipulse technology.
Although applying the Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio could partly compensate this decrease, differences between different surface/volume conditions could still be detected.
In contrast, the effect of the surface/volume tested was negligible for t-Tau and p-Tau.
Other previous studies have investigated the effect of CSF volume (or surface/volume) on AD biomarkers and reported similar results
Vanderstichele et al. found a 13.6% reduction in Aβ1-42 levels in aliquots of 0.5 ml compared to those containing 1.5 ml of CSF
In our study, we estimate a similar reduction of 15% (95%CI 11-20%) for the same volume comparison (0.5 ml vs. 1.5 ml).
This means that, for a sample with Aβ1-42 levels of 1000 pg/ml measured in the 1.5 ml aliquot, each 10 μl of decrease in the aliquot volume would be associated to an approximate reduction of 1.5 pg/ml (1.1-2.0 pg/ml) in Aβ1-42 levels.
Minor discrepancies between studies could be partly explained by differences in the pre-analytical conditions, in particular the nature of the tubes used to collect and treat the CSF, which is known to affect the adsorption phenomenon of Aβ1-42, and the number of freeze-thaw cycles.
Another source of variation might rely on differences in the immunoassays used in each study.
Vanderstichele et al.
Our data indicate that although the Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio could minimize the effect, it remained still detectable.
Other factors, such as long-term stability, have been observed to affect differently CSF levels of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40
It has been described that pre-treating the surface of recipients with detergents may reduce the adsorption phenomenon
It is possible that the hydrophobicity of the Aβ1-42 peptide compared to the Aβ1-40 peptide and the consequent adsorption to the storage tube surface explain their different behavior.
Differences in the characteristics of the assays for the two isoforms could also explain part of these discrepancies.
The impact that changes in storage volume might have in the diagnosis of AD has previously been studied
In our study, regarding Aβ1-42 and the Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, 1 out of 10 samples would change its status from the normal to the abnormal range according to our local cutoffs due to differences in the storage volume.
There would not be a significant status change regarding t-Tau or p-Tau.
However, we acknowledge that we included a small number of CSF samples and that clinical diagnoses were not balanced or taken into account in the inclusion criteria, and therefore this proportions need to be taken cautiously.
A larger study, specifically designed to address this issue, would provide a more accurate estimation of the clinical impact of changes in storage volume.
Considering the strong influence of pre-analytical conditions on biomarkers evaluation
Thus, for a same patient's CSF, the storage volume (and therefore the surface/volume ratio) was the only variable that changed through experiments.
We used a standard pre-analytical protocol, collected biological samples in a tube previously recommended by other consortia to limit adsorption phenomenon
In addition, the use of the same batch of Lumipulse reagents to quantify each biomarker and the fact that all samples from one patient were measured in the same run ensured a minimal interassay variation.
It is noteworthy that absolute values of biomarkers in our study are not directly comparable from those obtained with other immunoassays and under different operating procedures.
Our study has also some limitations.
We only tested one type of tube, and we did not test other pre-analytical factors that could potentially compensate the decrease of amyloid levels in higher surface/volume conditions, such as the addition of detergent or the quantification in fresh (non-frozen) samples.
Additionally, we did not test the potential inter-batch effect of storage tubes on amyloid levels.
Given the important role of CSF amyloid peptides for the biological diagnosis of AD, our results emphasize the necessity to take into account the CSF storage volume and surface/volume ratio when measuring AD biomarkers and when comparing results across studies.
They also highlight the relevance of keeping the same surface/volume conditions in each laboratory to be able to use specific internal cutoffs.
