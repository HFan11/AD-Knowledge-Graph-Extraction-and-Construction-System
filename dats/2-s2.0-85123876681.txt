Regulatory decisions diverge over aducanumab for Alzheimer’s disease
The European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorisation for aducanumab (Aduhelm), a monoclonal antibody targeted at amyloid β, in December 2021.
It noted that "although Aduhelm reduces amyloid beta in the brain, the link between this effect and clinical improvement had not been established." 1 Furthermore, it concluded "studies did not show that the medicine was sufficiently safe," citing reported side effects including brain swelling and bleeding.
This decision contrasts with that of the US Food and Drug Administration, which granted the drug accelerated approval in June 2021.
The FDA's approval of aducanumab for treatment of Alzheimer's disease was based on a reduction in amyloid β plaques during clinical trials.
Reduction in plaque levels is not a clinical endpoint, however, and the drug's manufacturer, Biogen, is required to complete post authorisation trials evaluating true clinical benefit.
This FDA approval has been one of the most consequential and controversial regulatory decisions in recent years.
The FDA's peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted almost unanimously against approval, and three panellists resigned following the decision. 4 5
A reduction in amyloid β plaques is known to be an unreliable surrogate for cognitive improvement or delayed clinical decline in adults with dementia, leading to criticism of this endpoint to justify accelerated approval. 6 7
This has fuelled wider discussions about the use of accelerated approval more broadly.
The FDA also allowed a generous nine years for confirmatory trials with clinical outcomes.
Biogen has indicated these trials should be completed by
The cost of treatment has also caused problems.
Biogen announced an initial annual cost of $56 000 (£42 000; €50 000) per patient, over 10 times the price recommended by the independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.
When combined with a large, eligible population, this could lead to a big increase in Medicare expenditure.
Although reimbursement decisions in the US usually follow FDA approvals, several leading healthcare providers and insurers have declined to use or fund aducanumab.
In December 2021, Biogen announced a 50% reduction in the annual cost of aducanumab in the US after feedback from its stakeholders, in the belief that patients are not being offered aducanumab because of the substantial cost.
e FDA and EMA have a high degree of concordance (>90%) in marketing authorisation decisions.
lthough each agency evaluates applications independently, since 2003 dialogue and cooperation have expanded, fostering greater alignment in decisions.
The divergence over aducanumab is therefore surprising, and it is important to consider possible reasons.

Different approaches
Typically, the FDA approves new drugs earlier than the EMA.
In the case of aducanumab, the EMA application was submitted 115 days after that to the FDA.
This delay may have permitted an application with more mature clinical and safety data, including data from Biogen's phase III clinical trials showing that 41.3% of patients who received a high dose (10 mg/kg) of aducanumab experienced brain swelling or bleeding compared with 10.3% in the placebo group.
Furthermore, in 2018 the EMA adopted revised guidelines for the "clinical investigation of medicines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
, 18 This guidance emphasises the need for clinical trials to show cognitive, functional, and global benefit.
Authorisation of aducanumab would have been inconsistent with this recommendation.
New drug approvals require "substantial evidence" of efficacy, typically through a demonstration of how patients feel, function, or survive.
Early approval pathways are intended to strike a careful balance to allow patients access to promising new therapies earlier, with confirmatory evidence later.
FDA's accelerated approval pathway has permitted early access to transformative new therapies such as imatinib for chronic myelogenous leukaemia.
However, in the early approval of aducanumab, the FDA is being overzealous, as the link between surrogate endpoint and improvement in symptoms or cognition has not been established, and is even refuted.
e divergence in opinion between the EMA and FDA is significant and may reflect the EMA's more cautious and scientifically grounded approach to the accelerated pathways.
Less than a week after the EMA decision, a Japanese health ministry advisory subgroup recommended deferring the decision on aducanumab, echoing similar efficacy and safety concerns and advising "effectiveness and safety should be re-examined through proper clinical trials."
th Biogen intending to appeal the EMA verdict and multiple new anti-amyloid drug hopefuls (such as donanemab) nearing regulatory submission, the debate about this approval could shape neurodegenerative drug development for many years. 11
Fostering greater engagement and harmonisation between global medicine regulators in their assessments would ensure regulatory standards and public trust are maintained.
