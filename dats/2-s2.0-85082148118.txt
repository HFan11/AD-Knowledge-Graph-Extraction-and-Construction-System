Pharmacological Mechanisms Underlying the Neuroprotective Effects of Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. on Alzheimer’s Disease
Alpinia oxyphylla Miq.
(i.e., A. oxyphylla), a traditional Chinese medicine, can exert neuroprotective effects in ameliorating mild cognitive impairment and improving the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Here, 50 active compounds and 164 putative targets were collected and identified with 251 clinically tested AD-associated target proteins using network pharmacology approaches.
Based on the Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichments, the compound-target-pathway-disease/protein-protein interaction network constructions, and the network topological analysis, we concluded that A. oxyphylla may have neuroprotective effects by regulating neurotransmitter function, as well as brain plasticity in neuronal networks.
Moreover, closely-related AD proteins, including the amyloid-beta precursor protein, the estrogen receptor 1, acetylcholinesterase, and nitric oxide synthase 2, were selected as the bottleneck nodes of network for further verification by molecular docking.
Our analytical results demonstrated that terpene, as the main compound of A. oxyphylla extract, exerts neuroprotective effects, providing new insights into the development of a natural therapy for the prevention and treatment of AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by brain atrophy, progressive cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral disturbances
The cardinal neuropathological features of AD include extracellular accumulations of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide
Several hypotheses about cholinergic system dysfunction
In addition, although several therapies have been used as compensation for the cholinergic neuronal loss and reduction or prevention of amyloid/tau aggregation and toxicity, such as gene therapy, vaccines, anti-inflammatory agents
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with thousands of years of history in China, has received widespread attention, particularly given the few side effects it carries, multi-target treatments, and natural origins
These medicines have been successfully utilized for the treatment of complex neurological disorders, such as AD
Alpinia oxyphylla (A.
oxyphylla), the dried ripe fruit of Alpinia oxyphylla Miq., has been long been thought to be "multivalent" for commonly treating diarrhea
Notably, terpene, the main component of A. oxyphylla, is regarded as a representative constituent with putative pharmacological activities by phytochemical studies.
Recently, several pharmacology studies have indicated that A. oxyphylla has definite beneficial effects in ameliorating cognitive disorders and alleviating pathological brain injuries characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders
Moreover, extracts also ameliorated the learning and memory impairment of AD mouse models after being administered by intracerebroventricular injection, which reduced β-amyloid levels significantly
However, despite the known therapeutic effects of A. oxyphylla, its pharmacological and molecular mechanism of action have not been fully elucidated.
Nonetheless, these aforementioned studies have given us a foundation to further study the molecular mechanisms of A. oxyphylla using systems pharmacology methodologies.
It is worth mentioning that our previous experiments have verified the neuroprotective effects of A. oxyphylla by extending the nonparalytic rate and reducing the mean paralysis rate on amyloid beta  transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C.
elegans) (data not shown).
In this paper, pharmacokinetic evaluation, target prediction, network, and pathway analysis using multiple available public databases and bioinformatics resources, have revealed potential pharmacological mechanisms and beneficial effects of A. oxyphylla on AD.

Screening of Candidate Compounds and Predicting Putative Target Proteins
The potential pharmacological mechanisms and the details behind each step in defining the role of A. oxyphylla on AD using system pharmacology are shown in Figure
Fifty compounds were selected as candidates by screening and excluding duplicates from the native compounds of A. oxyphylla based on the Symmap, TCMSP, TCM-MESH, and TCMID database analyses.
All 50 compounds were divided into 6 categories: 23 terpenes (e.g., oxyphyllol A, oxyphyllol B, zingiberol, among others), 6 fatty acids (e.g., lignoceric acid, oleic acid), 4 diphenylpeptanes (e.g., neonootkatol, oxyphyllacinol), 4 sterols (e.g., sitoterpene, sitoterpene palmitate), 3 flavonoids (chrysin, izalpinin, and tectochrysin), and 10 others (e.g., solanone, isovanilin, azaron, among others), as shown in Figure
A total of 31150 target proteins were fished along with the 50 candidate compounds using the Lipinski Rule of Five in QSAR and overlapping them with STITCH results.
A higher docking probability and combined score of putative target proteins indicated a closely integration with the compounds.
Among these target proteins, 164 targets were screened as putative target proteins, 99 of which were putative target proteins of terpenes (Table
Furthermore, the CT network was constructed and illustrated based on the various categories of compounds and putative proteins aligned (Figure
Compound nodes with red, green, gray, and white borders represented good, moderate, weak, and N/A level of ADMET evaluation respectively.
Among these, five terpenes (oxyphyllol B/C, oxyphyllenodiol A/B, and zingiberol), four diphenylpeptanes (neonootkatol, oxyphyllacinol, and yakuchinone A/B), and three flavonoids (chrysin, izalpinin, and tectochrysin) reflected good pharmacokinetic properties by the ADMET criterion.
Moreover, our Venn diagram clearly showed the overlapping of terpene proteins, which represent more than half of the protein targets, than any of the other five groups (Figure
Thus, we speculated that terpenes may be the predominant and unique primary bioactive substances mediating the neuroprotective effects of A. oxyphylla.

Exploration of A. oxyphylla Molecular Mechanism of Action
The 99 putative target proteins of terpenes were selected based on their integration score and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were initiated.
After filtering by a parameter p-value cutoff of ≤ 0.01, 579 GO terms and 28 KEGG pathway terms for terpenes were identified, as shown in Tables
A total of 579 GO terms were included: 459 for biological processes, 76 for molecular function, and 44 for cellular components (Table

In order to further inquire into the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating the neuroprotective mechanisms of A. oxyphylla, the compound-target-pathway (CTP) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of terpene main ingredients were carried out in this research.
Specifically, the CTP network model of terpenes contained 152 nodes and 995 edges, with 72 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.01) that were enriched in 28 pathways, based on the GO/KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (Figure
The ellipse nodes with red border represent the 13 AD-associated proteins and 4 key proteins (from 13 hubba proteins, Table
Importantly, the PPI network is the premise and basis to obtain nodes with more substantial contributions.
Overlap nodes were screened by valuable topological indices including degree, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and bottleneck nodes of the top 20 nodes, which have significant impact on the performance of the whole network.
In the PPI network, the estrogen receptor (ESR1), APP, D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2), and metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (GRM2) were filtered as bottleneck node proteins consistent with their molecular functions.
Clustering and topology approaches were utilized to identify individual variations and similarities among various protein targets (Figure

Furthermore, it is of great significance for compounds with better water solubility, blood-brain barrier permeability, and pharmacokinetic properties in thinking of drug design and development.
For better understanding of the mechanism of action and structure-activity relationship of terpenes and its putative targets, terpene compounds with good pharmacokinetic properties by the ADMET screening criteria and its common targets (i.e., ACHE, AR, HTR1E, NOS2, SRD5A2, CHRM4, and CYP17A1) were selected.
Among these target proteins, ACHE and NOS2 were found to be the overlapping nodes with AD-associated proteins, which is valuable for future studies.

Molecular Docking
In order to further verify the functional effects of terpenes in AD, the interaction between the active compounds of terpenes with good pharmacokinetic properties and key putative proteins were tested and verified randomly.
With the application of AutoDockTools-1.5.6, Discovery Studio 4.5 Client, and Pymol software, the interactions among the potential active compounds (i.e., oxyphyllol B, oxyphyllenodiol A, eucalyptol, and zingiberol), the AD-associated proteins (i.e., ACHE and NOS2), as well as the bottleneck node proteins (i.e., APP and ESR1) were elucidated.
Notably, the lower of binding energy meant the binding between the compounds and the targets were stronger.
The Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, and aromatic stacking (Pi-Sigma, Pi-alkyl, and alkyl interactions) were found to be involved between the active site residues and the potential compounds.
The 3D mode and 2D dimensional representation of oxyphyllol B (C07) in the active site of ACHE (6o4w) is represented in Figure
Interestingly, the free binding energy of C07 with ACHE was found to be -4.8 kcal/mol.
In addition, C07 showed two Pi-Sigma bond interactions with TRP 286, and eight Pi-alkyl bonds with TYR 124, PHE 297, TRP 286, and TYR 341.
The interaction types and distance of binding complexes are also depicted in the enlarged drawing in Figure
The following atoms, TYR 72, PHE 295, VAL 294, ARG 296, SER 293, and LEU 76 were served as the pocket atoms held together around the C07 compound by Van der Waals forces.
Similarly, the binding interaction of oxyphyllenodiol A (C08) and NOS2 (4nos) is shown in Figure
The free binding energy of C08 with NOS2 was found to be -4.68 kcal/mol.
In particular, C08 showed 3H-bond interactions with HIS 499, GLN 502, and VAL 500, respectively.
VAL 500 and LYS 254 also presented alkyl interactions with C08.
Additionally, THR498, GLN 310, GLY313, and ASP131 were able to bind with C08 by Van der Waals forces.
The interaction types and distance of these binding complexes are also depicted in the Ray tracing diagram in Figure
Moreover, the binding sites, interaction types and distances, as well as the active atoms of APP (5buo) with eucalyptol (C42) were analyzed and shown in Figure
The free binding energy of eucalyptol (C42) with APP (5buo) was found to be -3.9 kcal/mol.
C42 showed 1H-bond interactions with GLN 454 and three alkyl, as well as Pi-alkyl interactions with ILE 451, VAL 455, and HIS 458, respectively.
Meanwhile, C42 presented four Van der Waals forces among MET 383, HIS 436, THR 433, and GLU 387.
The 2D/3D mode and the interaction types and distance of zingiberol (C50) in the active site of ESR1 (3os8 revised mutation site) is represented in Figure
The free binding energy of C07 with ACHE was found to be -5.28 kcal/mol.
C50 showed 2H-bond interactions with ARG 434 and GLN 506, as well as one Pi-Sigma bond with HIS 513.
Moreover, C50 also had seven Alkyl and Pi-Alkyl interactions with HIS 513, ALA 430, ILE 510, and ARG 434, respectively.
There were two Van der Waals forces of THR 431 and LEU 509 with C50.

Among the putative target proteins of A. oxyphylla, 21 target proteins associated with AD and 8 putative target proteins (HDAC1, ESR1, EGFR, RELA, ESR2, AR, RAC1, TP53) had the characteristics of bottleneck nodes by topology analysis.

While the activation of D2-like receptors DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 have exactly the reverse effect on regulating the production of AC and cAMP in dopaminergic synapse pathway (hsa04728)
More evidence has suggested that DA influences neuronal activity, synaptic plasticity, and behavior by diverse cAMPand Ca 2+ -dependent and independent mechanisms (has 04020).
Similarly, ACh binds and activates muscarinic acetylcholine receptors CHRM1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
It also regulates the rapid influx of sodium (Na + ) and Ca 2+ , leading to the subsequent cellular depolarization by cAMP (hsa04024), MAPK (hsa04010), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (hsa04151) signaling pathways.
For monoamine neurotransmitters, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) binds to ionotropic 5-HT3 receptors, GPCR 5-HT receptors, 5-HT1 (Gi/Go -coupled), 5-HT2 (Gq-coupled), 5-HT4/6/7 (Gs-coupled), and 5-HT5 receptors, which can be directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection
Therefore, we hypothesize that A. oxyphylla or terpenoids are natural compounds that may play an important role in mediating anti-AD effects by functional annotation and enrichment analysis of neurotransmitter receptors.
Based on our topology analysis, hubba nodes screened, and protein-protein interaction network constructions of terpenes, two bottleneck node proteins, APP
The good molecular docking scores and results reflected that terpenes possess suitable anti-AD activity.
Other putative protein targets are also highly matched with several representative compounds in A. oxyphylla, however the specific actions and properties need to be further verified and probed in future studies.

A. oxyphylla, especially terpenes, appear to possess neuroprotective effects on regulating the synthesis, release, and transmission of neurotransmitters, as well as in the formation and plasticity of dendritic spines and synapses in the nervous system, which contributes, as a theoretical basis, to new insights for the development of novel anti-AD drugs.
