BACE-1 and γ-Secretase as Therapeutic Targets for Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health concern with a massive impact on affected individuals and society.
Despite the considerable advances achieved in the understanding of AD pathogenesis, researchers have not been successful in fully identifying the mechanisms involved in disease progression.
The amyloid hypothesis, currently the prevalent theory for AD, defends the deposition of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) aggregates as the trigger of a series of events leading to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.
Hence, several research and development (R&D) programs have been led by the pharmaceutical industry in an effort to discover effective and safety anti-amyloid agents as disease modifying agents for AD.
Among 19 drug candidates identified in the AD pipeline, nine have their mechanism of action centered in the activity of β or γ-secretase proteases, covering almost 50% of the identified agents.
These drug candidates must fulfill the general rigid prerequisites for a drug aimed for central nervous system (CNS) penetration and selectivity toward different aspartyl proteases.
This review presents the classes of γ-secretase and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors under development, highlighting their structure-activity relationship, among other physical-chemistry aspects important for the successful development of new anti-AD pharmacological agents.

Introduction

Alzheimer's Disease-Epidemiology
AD is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global public health priority
Notwithstanding the advances in the understanding of AD pathogenesis since Alois Alzheimer reported the first case in 1907
AD is the most prevalent cause of dementia-acquired progressive cognitive impairment sufficient to impact on activities of daily living, being a major cause of dependence, disability and mortality.
The WHO estimated that in 2010, 35.6 million worldwide were living with dementia
This figure is projected to almost double every 20 years, reaching 65.7 million by 2030 and 115.4 million by 2050.
Europe, with an estimated 10 million cases of dementia in 2010 and acquiring progressively an old population structure
In the United States of America (USA), the total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with AD or other dementias are projected to increase from $259 billion in 2017 to more than $1.1 trillion in 2050
These numbers show the dramatic impact that AD and the other dementias will have in the health care systems in the future.

Pathology
The main characteristics of Alzheimer's pathology are the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein)
In addition, neuropil treads, dystrophic neurites, associated astrogliosis, and microglial activation frequently coexist.
The downstream consequences of these pathological processes include neurodegeneration with synaptic and neuronal loss leading to macroscopic atrophy
Research suggests that the brain changes associated with AD may begin 20 or more years before symptoms appear
When the initial changes occur, the brain compensates for them, enabling individuals to continue to function normally.
As neuronal damage increases, the brain can no longer compensate for the changes and individuals show subtle cognitive decline.
Later, neuronal damage is so significant that individuals show obvious cognitive decline, including symptoms such as memory loss or confusion as to time or place

Current Pharmacology and Drug Development
Currently, five drugs are approved for the treatment of AD (Table
These include four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEi) -tacrine (approved in 1993), donepezil (approved in 1996), rivastigmine (1998), and galantamine (approved in 2001)
This class of drugs act by blocking the process that downregulate the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), a key signaling agent for nerve cells communication.
Although tacrine has been the first AChEi approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is currently not used due to its hepatotoxicity
Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine belong to the same therapeutic class, but present different pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles: donepezil is a noncompetitive reversible AChEi; galantamine is a selective reversible AChEi and a positive allosteric modulator of nicotinic ACh receptors; and rivastigmine acts as an inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)
These numbers show the dramatic impact that AD and the other dementias will have in the health care systems in the future.

An alternative therapy to AChEi is the administration of memantine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, approved in 2004.
This drug regulates the activity of glutamate in the brain.
Attachment of the neurotransmitter glutamate to the cell surface of NMDA receptors allows calcium to enter the cell.
This is an important event in cell signaling, as well as in learning and memory.
However, in AD patients, excess glutamate released from damaged cells leads to overexposure to calcium and accelerates cell damage.
Memantine disrupts this chain of events by blocking the NMDA receptors

Disease-Modifying Therapies and Drug Development
The drugs currently available for the treatment of AD only relieve symptoms, not being able to impact in the progression of the disease.
There is an urgent need for the development of disease modifying therapies or treatments (DMT's) able to prevent, delay, or slow the progression and target the primary pathophysiology mechanisms of AD.
It has been estimated that the overall frequency of the disease would be decreased by 40% if the onset of the disease could be delayed by 5 years
Unfortunately, drug development for AD has proven to be very difficult.
The high cost of drug development, the relatively long time needed to observe whether an investigational treatment affects disease progression and the needed capacity of the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are some factors that contribute to the absence of new approved drugs for AD.
Even considering the compounds that reach clinical trials, many of them fail to prove efficacy or present unacceptable toxicity, both small molecules and immunotherapies
Considering the decade between 2002 and 2012, 244 compounds were assessed in 413 trials for AD.
Of the agents which advanced to phase III, only one was advanced to FDA and approved for marketing (memantine).
This represents an overall success rate for approval of 0.4%, which is among the lowest for any therapeutic area
However, besides the mentioned difficulties in the development of new therapies for AD, there are currently large research programs for the drug development of new anti-AD agents.
In 2018, there were 112 agents in the AD pipeline, of which 23 in phase I, 63 in phase II and 26 in phase III.
Across all stages, 63% are DMTs, 34% symptomatic agents for neuropsychiatric and behavioral changes, and 3% have undisclosed mechanism of action (MoA)
Twenty five percent of the agents have an amyloid-related MoA (12% immunotherapy and 14% small molecules), 14% anti-tau, 22% neurotransmitter-based (symptomatic treatment agents), 18% neuroprotection/ anti-inflammatory, 18% metabolic and 3% with other mechanisms

The Amyloid Hypothesis of AD
The amyloid hypothesis, the current prevalent theory of AD pathogenesis, suggests that the accumulation of pathological forms of Aβ, due to an increase of production and/or decreased clearance, is the primary pathological process in AD
The accumulation of Aβ peptides leads to their oligomerization and formation of Aβ plaques.
These plaques generate an anti-inflammatory response causing oxidative stress in neurons and disrupting normal kinase and phosphatase activity, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of tau protein and subsequent neurofibrillary tangle formation.
This cascade of events leads to abnormal signaling and synaptic impairment, resulting ultimately in neuronal dead and dementia in the AD patient
This is schematized in Figure

This is schematized in Figure
The longer peptide A 42 has been shown to be the most prone to aggregation, with an increased A 42:A 40 ratio observed in the familial form of the disease
The activity of -cleavage is considered to determine the total amount of A production, and the efficiency of the successive -cleavage impacts the production ratio of toxic A 42 to total A
The amyloid hypothesis is strongly supported by genetic findings.
All the known familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) mutations are involved in either A increase generation or processing and Aβ is produced by a two-step sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP): first beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) cleaves APP to generate soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) and a 99 amino acid fragment (C99), which then suffers several cleavage events by γ-secretase to produce peptides of different lengths from 38 to 43 amino acids, being Aβ40 and Aβ42 the main products and both playing a key role in the aggregation of neuritic plaques
The longer peptide Aβ42 has been shown to be the most prone to aggregation, with an increased Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio observed in the familial form of the disease

The amyloid hypothesis is strongly supported by genetic findings.
All the known familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) mutations are involved in either Aβ increase generation or processing and result in relative overproduction of toxic forms of Aβ, namely Aβ42
On the other hand, it was reported that a mutation in the APP gene (A673T), identified from a set of whole-genome sequence data of 1795 Iceland people, results in a lifelong decrease in APP cleavage by β-secretase conferring a reduced clinical risk of AD and age-related decline
Besides the fact that occurrence of AD and genetic mutations associated with Aβ formation supports the amyloid hypothesis, some observations remains without explanation, with histological studies being controversial in the correlation between the formation of Aβ plaques and cognitive decline
Karran et al.
If individuals are at risk of developing AD but Aβ deposition has not yet occurred, then a significant reduction of Aβ42 production or a decrease in the longer amyloid-β/shorter amyloid-β ratio would be expected to prevent the onset of disease within a normal lifetime
Although there are further questions concerning the exact neuronal toxicity of Aβ, the amyloid hypothesis is still broadly accepted as the general pathological cascade of events in AD

Amyloid Targeting Strategies
Following the amyloid hypothesis, where a high brain Aβ level is observed as an important factor in AD pathogenesis, pharmacological intervention to reduce its production or improve the clearance has become a logical approach for AD therapy development.
Considering the 112 agents in the AD pipeline in 2018
With regard to small molecules, different targets have been identified for activity modulation hoping to get a marked impact in the amyloid cascade and in disease progression.
Among 16 anti-amyloid agents identified in the AD pipeline, six have their mechanism of action centered in the activity of β or γ-secretase proteases, covering almost 40% of the identified agents.
In fact, in the last years several pharmaceutical industries and other research centers have led research programs to discovered potent compounds for the modulation or inhibition of these two targets
The discovery and optimization activities which lead to the development of these compounds will be herein detailed.

Gamma Secretase Inhibitors and Modulators
Gamma secretase (GS) (Figure
PS is the catalytic component of γ-secretase.
In humans, PS is encoded by the PSEN1 (PS-1) gene on chromosome 14 or the PSEN2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1, and mutations in both genes have been found to cause fAD
The products of these genes (PS-1 and PS-2) are nine transmembrane domain (TMD) proteins that form the catalytic subunit of GS
GS cleaves several type-I transmembrane proteins (over 90 reported substrates), being APP and Notch the best characterized substrates
The activity of GS on the substrate APP occurs after the cleavage performed by β-secretase (BACE-1).
Then, GS perform a series of cleavages within the transmembranar domain of the remaining fragment (C99), termed epsilon (ε), zeta (ζ), and gamma (γ) cleavages, allowing the generation of Aβ peptides of different lengths (Figure

The cleavage (1) releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and produces A 49 or A 48
Then, the carboxypeptidase cleavages (2) and (3 and 4) progressively trims these longer A forms in both A 40 and A 42
The successive cleavage events performed by GS consists in four cycles to generate A 40
Further cleavage will subsequently generate the shorter isoforms A 39and A 37
Many fAD-causing mutations in PS have been found to decrease the catalytic activity of GS
This loss of function contributes to the increased A 42:A 40 ratio observed in the familial form of the disease
A 42 Notch the best characterized substrates

Aβ42 is consider the most toxic Aβ isoform due to its high propensity to form fibrillary and non-fibrillary aggregates.
On the other hand, shorter Aβ peptides are speculated to be less toxic or even neuroprotective

γ-Secretase Inhibitors
Based on the genetic evidence of the role of GS and Aβ formation on AD, the pharmaceutical industry made efforts in developing compounds able to inhibit this protease and, consequently, reduce the amount of Aβ peptide formation.
Two key γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), semagacestat (1) from Eli Lilly & Co and later avagacestat (2) from Bristol-Myers Squibb (Figure

Two key -secretase inhibitors (GSIs), semagacestat (1) from Eli Lilly & Co and later avagacestat (2) from Bristol-Myers Squibb (Figure
Unfortunately, due to GS high promiscuity in terms of substrates, several side effects were observed throughout the clinical trials with these compounds
The main responsible pointed for these adverse effects was Notch, a single-pass type I transmembrane receptor
Notch is processed in a similar way as C99, where the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released after the -cleavage and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression and to mediate important intercellular communication functions as cellular differentiation.
Additionally, Notch pathway is involved in neurogenesis, neuritic growth and long-term memory
The inhibitory effect of GSIs blocks thecleavage of -secretase affecting the Notch signaling, leading to several adverse events as skin cancer, decreased lymphocyte count and/or memory loss.
These adverse effects were observed in phase III clinical trial of semagacestat (1)
Consequently, subsequent drug-development programs have aimed to achieve a greater separation between APP and Notch inhibition.
Bristol-Myers Squibb developed avagacestat (2) and reported it as having a 137-fold selectivity for APP over Notch in cell culture, and to robustly reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A levels without causing Notch-related toxicity in rats and dogs
However, a phase II clinical trial performed with avagacestat demonstrated a side-effect profile similar to the one found with semagacestat (1)
These results were attributed to an overestimation of the selectivity of avagacestat between Notch and APP, with other researchers indicating an only 3-fold selectivity for cleavage of an APP substrate compared with a Notch substrate
The disappointing results obtained with these two GSI led to discontinuation of the development of GSIs as therapeutic strategy against AD.
Additionally, other options as GS modulators arose as safer disease modifying therapies for AD.

Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Derived GSM's
The first generation of GSMs was discovered from an epidemiological study documenting a reduced prevalence of AD among users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Then, in 2001 Weggen et al.
The first generation of GSMs was discovered from an epidemiological study documenting a reduced prevalence of AD among users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Then, in 2001 Weggen et al.
This change in the cleavage pattern could be explained by 1) a decrease in the probability of releasing longer A from the enzyme-substrate complex (defined as dissociation constant, d) of GS, or 2) an increase in the cleavage activity (defined by the catalytic constant, cat) of GS.

Other pharmaceutical companies, namely Schering, Roche, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, between others, had their own programs for the development of non-NSAID derived GSM
The scaffold of the four consecutive linked rings firstly reported by Neurogenetics can be found in most of the non-NSAID compounds developed
Consequently, they share the same suboptimal drug-like properties as the first non-NSAID derived GSM, leading to a lack of compounds reaching clinical evaluation.

Considering this genetic information, the inhibition of APP proteolysis by BACE-1 to lower the concentration of neurotoxic A peptides became a rational strategy for clinical intervention.
BACE-1 protease is characterized by a large catalytic domain which is marked by the centrally located catalytic aspartates Asp32 and Asp228.
Free BACE-1 features a flap-open conformation that is energetically stable due to the multiple hydrogen bonds in the flap region of the enzyme.

BACE-1 Inhibitor Development
Initially, the development of BACE-1 inhibitors appeared to be a relatively simple approach.
First, the development of successful clinical aspartic proteases inhibitors for other therapeutic areas, namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hypertension, had established an important knowledge for the development of others aspartic protease inhibitors
Second, the first crystal structure of this secretase, elucidated in 2000, provided powerful information for the structure-based drug design of BACE-1 inhibitors
However, progress has been difficulted by combination of properties needed for being efficacious: compounds must fulfill the general rigid prerequisites for a drug aimed for CNS penetration and at the same time be compatible with the large and hydrophobic catalytic pocket of BACE-1.
Moreover, selectivity toward different aspartyl proteases have been an additional attrition factor in BACE-1 drug discovery.
Nevertheless, despite the many challenges in the design of selective and effective BACE-1 inhibitors, several pharmaceutical industries have made impressive efforts for the improvement of BACE-1 inhibitors, with several compounds currently under clinical development.
Peptidomimetics, compounds mimicking the sequences of BACE-1 substrates were the first BACE-1 inhibitors developed and showed potent activity in vitro
However, these large compounds suffer from poor PK properties, such as low bioavailability and low penetrance across the BBB, leading to the unsuccess of their development.
Consequently, the design of BACE-1 inhibitors has focused on small molecules with nonpeptidic nature with improved PK properties and BBB penetration.
Herein, a general overview of the structural evolution of BACE-1 inhibitors with a focus on the medicinal chemistry aspects of drug development programs will be provided.

Acyl-Guanidine-Based Inhibitors
A series of acyl guanidine-based BACE-1 inhibitors were discovered by high-throughput screening (HTS) by Wyeth (acquired by Pfizer in 2009)
An X-ray crystal structure of compound 18 complexed with the catalytic domain of BACE-1 revealed that the acyl guanidine moiety forms four key hydrogen interactions with the catalytic aspartic acids Asp32 and Asp228
A structural change in BACE-1 upon binding with the compound was observed, in which the flap region adopts an "open conformation", due to stabilized interactions between Tyr71 and the π-system of the diarylpyrrole ligand 18
Additionally, it was observed that the two aryl groups extend into the S1 and S2 pockets and the para position of the P 1 phenyl group projects directly to an unoccupied S3 subsite, allowing the addition of substituents in the P 1 phenyl and potentially increasing binding affinity.
In contrast to the S1-S3 pockets, S2 provides access to more polar/charged groups, allowing to explore analogues of compound 18 able to form hydrogen-bonds in this region

According with the information substitutions were made to compound 18 in order to improve potency.
Compound 19, containing a para propyloxyphenyl moiety in the unsubstituted aryl ring and a propyl alcohol in the third guanidine nitrogen, allowed an improvement of approximately 30-fold in potency comparing with compound 18.

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) also worked in an acyl guanidine series (Figure
Starting with hit compound 22 it was developed compound 20 with a good potency against BACE-1 (IC50 = 5.0 nM) and inactive against other aspartyl proteases tested, namely cathepsin D (CatD), cathepsin E (CatE) and pepsin (IC50 > 100.000 nM)

The optimized compound 20 was evaluated in rats in order to access its effect on Aβ40 levels in plasma, brain and CSF.
Although a marked and dose-dependent reduction was observed in plasma Aβ40 (about 80%) no significant reduction in brain and in CSF was achieved (<20%).
This lack of efficacy on brain and CSF was ascribed to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux.
Further improvement was necessary to maximize its PK properties

2-Aminopyridine-Based Inhibitors
A key advance in the development of small molecule BACE-1 inhibitors was the discovery of 2amino heterocycles that, comparing with the initial acyl guanidine compounds, generally enable a better physico-chemical profile, improved brain penetration and in vivo efficacy
Wyeth developed a series of pyrrolyl 2-aminopyridines, as an extension of their work on acyl guanidine inhibitors represented in Figure
Acyl guanidine inhibitors are polar compounds as suggested by the high total polar surface area (TPSA) 80 particularly due to the acyl guanidine moiety, which was associated to the poor BBB permeation (<5%) observed with this class of compounds.
The bioisosteric replacement of the acyl guanidine moiety in compound 18 by an aminopyridine (compound 23) was performed to improve compound permeability, maintaining the hydrogen-bonding interactions with the aspartic acids in the catalytic site of BACE-1

Introduction of polar groups is used as a common strategy to reduce hERG binding affinity.
However, it increases TPSA, which is strongly correlated with increased P-gp recognition.
A series of SAR studies were conducted in order to determinate how to balance hERG, P-gp ER and BACE-1 potency by identifying regions of the molecule where polarity could be incorporated to minimize hERG activity without leading to a significant efflux or a potency decrease.
This balance was accomplished by introducing polarity at the P2' site and at the same time reducing the TPSA of the P3 group (Figure
The introduction of a fluorine in position 4 of the xanthene ring also improved BACE-1 enzymatic and cellular potencies, attributed to a favorable hydrogen-bond interaction between the 4-fluor atom and NH of Trp76 of BACE-1

Conclusions
The discovery of disease modifying agents for AD has shown to be very challenging for medicinal chemists.
Compounds should exhibit improved CNS penetration by enhanced BBB permeability and reduced P-gp ER.
The physical chemistry characteristics needed for this PK properties need to be balanced with target requirements, in which the improvements of these properties sometimes lead to a reduction on binding affinity and potency.
Additionally, off-target effects also need to be addressed, being these features one of the principal causes for the discontinuation of clinical programs.
Medicinal chemistry teams have utilized high throughput and virtual screening followed by chemical optimization trying to accommodate several physico-chemical nuances and discover new compounds able to be safety and efficacy in modifying AD progression.
Taking into consideration the actual AD pipeline, a special focus has been given to BACE-1 as a target for a disease modifying therapy for AD.
The information currently available pointed the inhibition of BACE-1 as a safety and efficacy target for Aβ reduction.
All the adverse effects identified up to date in the use of BACE-1 inhibitors were pointed as off-target effects, confirming BACE-1 as a suitable target to explore.
Nevertheless, medicinal chemists should perform extended SAR studies, not only for potency and PK properties exploration, but also in terms of selectivity, providing the discovery of compounds highly selective for BACE-1 against other related proteases such as CatD.
Another question stands on the adequacy of the pharmacological therapy with the stage of Alzheimer disease (AD).
The use of disease modifying therapies as BACE-1 inhibitors should be a suitable option for early stages of AD where minimum neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction are observed.
On the other hand, in a mild-to-moderate AD scenario it would possibly be too late in the disease process for BACE-1 inhibition to be effective and a symptomatically therapeutic should be preferred.
In sum, the future of AD will rely on the development of potent, selective and safety compounds able to delay AD progression and neuronal impairment.
At the same time, it is essential the identification of specific biomarkers to allow an early and efficacious pharmacological intervention.
