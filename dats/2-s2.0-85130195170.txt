Exosomes Derived From M2 Microglia Cells Attenuates Neuronal Impairment and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease Through the PINK1/Parkin Pathway
The accumulation of abnormal aggregation of amyloid-β plaques is one of the most distinguishing pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is highly toxic to neurons.
Exosomes have demonstrated great potential for AD therapy.
However, the impact and underlying mechanism of M2 microglia-derived exosomes (M2-EXOs) in AD progression and outcome are seldom explored.
Therefore, we employed an Aβ1-42 oligomer (Aβ)-induced AD model in neuronal HT-22 cells and 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice to investigate the effects of M2-EXOs on AD.
We revealed that the AD cell model established by Aβ was accompanied by the upregulation of Aβ1-42, neuronal death, alternation of mitochondrial function and autophagy.
M2-EXOs can be internalized by HT-22 cells and MAP2-positive neuronal cells in APP/PS1 mice, and exert neuroprotective functions.
Specifically, the administration of M2-EXOs in the AD cell model partially increased cell viability, restored the destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species inside the mitochondria and cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Moreover, we demonstrated that PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy was enhanced, while incubation with M2-EXOs decreased beclin1, LC3II, PINK1, and Parkin expression levels.
Finally, we observed that compared with APP/PS1 mice treated with PBS, the application of M2-EXOs could decrease Aβ plaque deposition and minus Aβ oligomer expression along with improved PINK1/Parkin pathway-mediated autophagy.
Overall, our results imply that M2-EXOs play a protective role in the pathogenesis of AD by ameliorating PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, indicating that it may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to treat AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in people over 65 years of age and is one of the most burdening diseases worldwide, with no cure
The distinguishing pathology of AD is the presence of abnormal aggregation of amyloid-β plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, accompanied by neuronal death and injury to brain tissue, resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment
Nevertheless, the exact pathogenesis of AD remains unclear.
Serving as the resident innate immune cells, microglia can regulate the immune response and mediate crucial functions to dynamically maintain cerebral homeostasis
Microglia exert neurotoxic or neuroprotective functions depending on the polarization phenotype: classic M1 activation and alternative M2 activation
Mounting evidence suggests that M2 microglia could potently alleviate pathological damage in AD by inhibiting neuroinflammation, promoting tissue repair, and suppressing Aβ deposition and the clustering of neurofibrillary tangles
Exosomes are one specific type of extracellular vesicle, typically with sizes ranging from 30 to 150 nm in diameter, secreted by multiple cells, including microglia
Increasing evidence indicates that exosomes have a critical impact on mediating the communication of different cells and can exert therapeutic effects in various diseases through specific cargoes
Furthermore, previous studies have confirmed that exosomes derived from M2 microglia could attenuate neuronal apoptosis, moderate the formation of the glial scar, thereby relieving ischemic brain damage
Mitochondria are essential for cell function and survival, especially in neurons
Along with the energy crisis, mitochondrial damage is also involved in oxidative stress and cell death, which were considered to participate in the pathogenic mechanism of AD
Mitochondrial homeostasis is governed by mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, the selective elimination of superfluous or functionally impaired mitochondria via autophagy
One of the most important mechanisms of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases is the PTEN-induced putative kinase1 (PINK1)/Parkin signaling pathway
Based on the aforementioned information, we designed this study to investigate whether M2-EXOs can attenuate mitochondrial damage in AD progression through the mediation of mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Establishment of the in vitro Alzheimer's Disease Model
In a humidified incubator at 37 • C with 5% CO2, HT-22 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Every 2 days, the complete culture medium was renewed.
Before the experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes at an appropriate concentration and incubated until they reached 60-70% confluency.
The oligomer of amyloid-β protein fragment 1-42 (Aβ) was added to the serum-free culture medium for 48 h at a final concentration of 5 µ m/mL.

M2 Microglial Cell Activation and Identification
BV2 cells were used as a substitute for microglia to obtain M2-EXOs.
In a humidified incubator at 37 • C with 5% CO2, cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).
To avoid the influence of exosomes on FBS, cells were briefly cleaned twice using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before activation.
Subsequently, interleukin 4 (IL-4; PeproTech) was added to the 10% exosomedepleted FBS (SBI) culture medium at a final concentration of 20 ng/mL to activate the M2 phenotype.
After 48 h, the medium was then collected for the subsequent isolation of exosomes.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence were performed to identify M2 BV2 cells.

Preparation of the Amyloid-β Protein Fragment 1-42 Oligomer
The human Aβ1-42 peptide (GL Biochem Ltd.) was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP; Macklin) initially to obtain a 1-mM solution.
Subsequently, HFIP was removed using the SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific) to obtain a clear peptide film.
The film could be kept at -80 • C for 6 months.
Before use, the Aβ film was redissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide and sonicated for 10 minutes to ensure complete re-suspension, followed by dilution to 100 µm with DMEM.
The solution was incubated for at least 24 h and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for at least 10 min at 4 • C. Finally, Aβ oligomers could be obtained in the supernatant.

Cell Viability Assay
The viability of HT-22 cells was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo) and Calcein/PI Cell Viability Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The results of the CCK-8 assay were estimated by the optical density value at 450 nm in each well using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).
Calcein/propidium iodide (PI) staining was evaluated as the number of cells exhibiting green fluorescence divided by the sum of the number of cells displaying green and red fluorescence.

Isolation, Identification, and Labeling of Exosomes
To remove dead cells, M2 BV2-conditioned medium was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min.
Next, to further remove cell debris and particles, the supernatant was centrifuged sequentially at 2000 g for 20 min at 10,000 × g for 30 min.
After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min, exosomes could be initially isolated.
PBS was used to wash the isolated exosomes once at 100,000 g for 70 min, and the exosomes were resuspended for further characterization.
All centrifugations were performed at 4 • C.
For M2-EXOs identification, the morphology was captured using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the diameter distribution range of particles was examined using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA); Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of exosomal surface marker CD63 and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101).
The red fluorescent membrane dye PKH26 (Sigma) was used to label M2-EXOs according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The labeled exosomes were diluted in PBS for further experiments.

Detection of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of HT-22 cells was measured using the mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit (JC-1, Beyotime).
Cells with different treatments were stained with the JC-1 staining solution for at least 20 min in the dark at 37 • C and then washed using warm wash buffer.
Then Leica confocal microscope (Leica SP8) was used to observe the fluorescence of J-aggregates (red) and J-monomers (green) within 30 min.

Detection of Intracellular and Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Production
To determine the intracellular accumulation level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), different groups of HT-22 cells were treated with 10-µm dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; Beyotime) and 200-nm MitoTracker Red (Beyotime) for 20 min in the dark at 37 • C. To determine mitochondrial ROS production, 5-µm MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen) and 200-nm MitoTracker Green (Beyotime) were used to stain different groups of HT-22 cells for 20 min in the dark at 37 • C. Subsequently, the cells were washed using warm DMEM and observed using a confocal microscope.

Western Blot Analysis
A radio-immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime) were utilized to isolate proteins from cells and exosomes.
The protein concentrations were evaluated by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime) and adjusted.
Proteins were separated and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore).
Five percent non-fat powdered milk (Beyotime) was then used to block membranes for 1 h.
After that, the membranes were incubated with different primary antibodies against LC3 (1:1000, Abmart), beclin1 (1:2000; Proteintech), Parkin (1:1000; ABclonal), PINK1 (1:1000; Abcam), CD206 (1:1000; Boster), Arginase-1 (Arg-1, 1:1000; Proteintech), CD63 (1:1000; UMIBIO), TSG101 (1:1000; UMIBIO), Aβ

Immunofluorescence
Cells were resuspended on 35-mm confocal dishes and subjected to different treatments.
Then, cells or brain tissue section were washed, fixed, permeabilized, and blocked.
Next, they were incubated with different primary antibodies overnight at 4 • C (LC3, 1:100; Abmart), Parkin (1:100; ABclonal), PINK1 (1:100; Abcam), CD206 (1:100; R&D Systems), and Arg-1 (1:200; Proteintech), and incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies (1:600; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, Cell nuclei were counterstained with the 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution.
The confocal microscope (TCS-SP8; Leica) was utilized to acquire images.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (QRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the EZ-press RNA Purification Kit (EZB).
Then 1000ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara) was utilized to carry out qualitative (q)-PCR with the Stepone Plus Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems Life Technology).
Fold changes in gene expression levels were estimated using the 2-Ct method.
The primer sequences were listed below: GAPDH, 5 -AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3 and 5 -TGTAGACCATG TAGTTGAGGTCA-3 ; Arg1 5 -GAACACGGCAGTGGCTT TAAC-3 and 5 -TGCTTAGCTCTGTCTGCTTTGC-3 ; and CD206, 5 -TCTTTGCCTTTCCCAGTCTCC-3 and 5 -TGA CACCCAGCGGAATTTC-3 .

Animal Experimental Design
7-months-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and wild-type mice from the same litter were randomly distributed into three groups: WT group, APP/PS1 group and M2-EXOs treated group, five mice in each group.
Specifically, in M2-EXOs group, 100 µg purified M2-EXOs were dissolved in 100 µl PBS and was injected to each APP/PS1 mouse via tail vein once a week.
Mice in APP/PS1 group were injected with equal amounts of saline.
After 2 months, all mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline solution, the brains were harvested.
Half of each brain was quickly frozen using liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 • for protein collection, and the other was fixed, dehydrated and cut into frozen slices at 10 µm for immunostaining.
All animal procedures were approved and carried out in accordance with the recommendations by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fudan University.

Thioflavin S (ThioS) Staining
The prepared slices were soaked in 1% ThioS (Sigma) dissolved in 50% ethanol in the dark for 8 min.
After that, the sections were washed twice with 50% ethanol for 10 s each time, and finally with distilled water for 5 min.
The results were observed using confocal microscopy and analyzed with image J software.

Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism GraphPad software (version 9.0).
Differences between two groups were evaluated using Student's t-test.
Differences among more than two groups were assessed using analysis of variance.
All data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SD).
P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

The Establishment of AD Cell Model
Firstly, we established the AD model with the Aβ1-42 oligomer, as previously described
The results of the Western blot assay demonstrated that incubation of HT-22 cells with 5 µm Aβ for 48 h could markedly upregulate the expression of Aβ1-42 (Figure
Then we used different assays to check the impact of Aβ treatment on the viability of HT-22 cells.
The results of the CCK-8 assay illustrated that Aβ significantly reduced the OD values of HT-22 cells (Figure
To visualize the extent of cell damage, we performed a calcein/PI cell viability assay.
Calcein-stained living cells displayed green fluorescence, whereas PI-stained dead cells exhibited red fluorescence.
Consistent with the results of the CCK-8, we observed that Aβ caused serious cell death (Figure
In short, these data implied that we successfully established AD model with HT-22 cells.

Aβ Treatment Induced Mitochondrial Impairment and Alternation of Mitophagy
As the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential can indicate mitochondrial dysfunction, we then determined MMP using a mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit with JC-1.
Normally, JC-1 exists as J-aggregates and displays red fluorescence in healthy cells.
In mitochondria-damaged cells, Next, we investigated the effect of Aβ on mitophagy, which is strongly linked to mitochondrial quality.
For this aim, we used Western blot analysis to determine the levels of autophagy markers LC3II and beclin1.
As presented in Figures
These results suggested that Aβ treatment reduced mitochondrial quantity, and enhanced mitophagy.

Identification and Characterization of Exosomes Derived From M2 Microglia Cells
To investigate whether we successfully isolated exosomes from the M2 microglia-conditioned medium, we first identified the characteristics of M2 microglia cells polarized by IL-4.
CD206 and Arg1 are classic M2-polarized microglial markers, and as shown in Figure
The results of Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses also showed that IL-4 stimulation markedly enhanced the expression levels of Arg1 and CD206, implying that IL-4 successfully promoted microglia toward the M2 phenotype (Figures
Then, we isolated exosomes from the M2 microgliaconditioned medium by ultracentrifugation.
Under TEM, we observed that the precipitated particles were round and exhibited a typical cup-like structure (Figure
NTA illustrated that the diameter distribution range of the particles was from 30 to150 nm (Figure
Further, Western blot analysis results proved that the specific exosomal biomarkers, including CD63 and TSG101, were substantially expressed in the precipitation (Figure
In a word, we successfully isolated exosomes from the M2 microglia-conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation.

M2-EXOs Could Be Phagocytosed by the AD Model and Exert Protective in a Dose-Dependent Way
Next, in order to investigate the effects of M2-EXOs on the AD model, we initially need to determine whether M2-EXOs
To sum up, we initially found that M2-EXOs attenuated Aβ-induced cellular death and mitophagy activation in a dosedependent manner.

M2-EXOs Attenuated Mitochondrial Dysfunction of the AD Model
In this section, we explored the impact of M2-EXOs on Aβinduced mitochondrial damage.
As H-EXOs appeared to be the most effective, this concentration was used to perform the following experiments.
First, we observed that M2-EXOs reversed the number of dead cells (Figures
We then analyzed the accumulation degree of intracellular and mitochondrial ROS using DCFH-DA and MitoSOX staining, which were quantified as the relative ratio of green to red fluorescence intensity and the relative ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity, respectively.
The results showed that the cellular (Figures
Additionally, the immunofluorescence images revealed that compared with the control group, the number of LC3 punctate dots was markedly decreased in the AD model.
However, this effect was alleviated by coculture with M2-EXOs (Figures
In summary, we demonstrated that M2-EXOs could play a protective role in damaged neurons by ameliorating mitochondrial impairment and cell death.

PINK1/Parkin Pathway Was Involved in the Protective Effects of M2 Microglia-Derived Exosomes
As abundant evidence has revealed that autophagic elimination of injured mitochondria is mainly mediated by the PINK1/Parkin
In summary, these findings indicate that the defensive effect of M2-EXOs may be mediated through the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

M2-EXOs Reduced the Deposition of Aβ in APP/PS1 Mice
Next, we evaluated the role of M2-EXOs in APP/PS1 mice.
First, we tested whether exosomes injected into mice through the tail vein could enter the brain.
As shown in Figure
Then we assessed the Aβ plaque deposition using Thios staining.
Compared with WT mice, Aβ plaques were significantly increased in the brain of PBS treated APP/PS1 control mice, while the administration of M2-EXOs repressed the Aβ plaques deposition levels in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (Figures
We also performed western blot assay to detect the expression level of Aβ oligomers in the brain of each group of mice.
As shown in Figures
In conclusion, above data illustrated that M2-EXOs could moderate pathological progression in APP/PS1 mice.

M2-EXOs Improves Mitophagy in APP/PS1 Mice Through Inactivation of PINK1/Parkin Pathway
Finally, we determined the alternation of mitophagy in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice using Western blot analysis.
Consistent with the findings from our in vitro experiments, the results confirmed that APP/PS1 mice treated with PBS alone showed the upregulation of LC3II, beclin1, Parkin and PINK1 compared to WT mice.
Notably, the upregulation extent of LC3II, beclin1, Parkin and PINK1 in APP/PS1 was significantly reduced by treatment with M2-EXOs (Figures
These data indicate that M2-EXOs inhibits the activation of mitophagy pathway in APP/PS1 mice.

DISCUSSION
In this research, we verified the therapeutic effects of M2-EXOs against Aβ toxicity in HT-22 cells and APP/PS1 mice.
We observed that M2-EXOs promoted neuronal survival, restored the destruction of MMP, and reduced ROS production inside the mitochondria and cells.
The protective effects of M2-EXOs may be associated with PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy.
In addition, we further confirmed the effects of M2-EXOs in APP/PS1 mice.
AD is an insidiously progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs primarily in the elderly, with progressive cognitive and behavioral impairment as the main clinical manifestation
Aβ is one of the hallmarks of AD, and extensive studies have shown that Aβ is toxic to neurons and causes cell death
Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence have identified Aβ oligomer as crucial cytotoxins associated with AD, as it can damage synaptic function and inhibit long-term potentiation, which is the is the main mechanism responsible for memory decline
Strategies that can reduce Aβ formation or interrupt their neurotoxicity are badly needed
In accordance with previous studies
Cumulative evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical feature in animal models of AD and in patients with AD
Therefore, we examined the mitochondrial function of cells in the AD model.
Consistent with another previous study
In addition, intracellular ROS was mainly generated in mitochondria, and dysfunctional mitochondria can cause disproportionate ROS generation.
Further, previous studies have shown that ROS levels in neuronal cells are upregulated in AD
Our results demonstrated that Aβ treatment can stimulate both intracellular and mitochondrial ROS production.
Mitophagy is one type of autophagy that selectively eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria and is critical for mitochondrial quality control.
Increasing evidence has revealed that abnormal mitophagy occurs in the brains of patients with AD.
Both in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed that Aβ can disrupt the dynamics of mitophagy
Consistent with other studies
Recently, exosomes have emerged as a novel and promising candidate approach for AD therapy owing to their unique advantages
Specifically, exosomes are stable in physiological fluids and can cross the blood-brain barrier, secrete various proteins and RNAs, and mediate the mutual communication between cells.
Furthermore, accumulating evidence has shown that microgliaderived exosomes can regulate glial scar formation, inhibit neuronal inflammation, and promote neurite outgrowth after stroke
However, the understanding of the beneficial effects of M2-EXOs on AD is in the early stages.
Here, we successfully isolated exosomes from the conditioned medium of M2 microglia and observed that M2-EXOs administration increased cell viability, restored the disruption of MMP, and decreased the expressions of LC3II, beclin1 and Aβ 1-42.
In neural cells, PINK1/Parkin mediated signaling is the most dominant signaling pathway of mitophagy.
Besides,
Consistent with their findings, we also observed overexpression of PINK1 and Parkin in the AD cell model and 7-monthold APP/PS1 mice, as determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, while the administration of M2-EXOs decreased their expression in a dose-dependent manner.
Thus, we speculated that M2-EXOs may exert their protective role through the Pink1/Parkin pathway.
In conclusion, our study's results indicate that M2-EXOs can restore cell apoptosis, alleviate mitochondrial function, and reduce ROS production by improving PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy, and these data may offer new insights into the therapeutic effect of M2-EXOs on AD.
Despite great advances in our understanding of how M2-EXOs could restore AD model injury, the detailed mechanism of the events taking place remains limited.
As exosomes exert their function by transferring proteins, messenger RNAs, and micro RNAs, in this respect, Huang et al. demonstrated that the expression level of miR-124-3p elevated in microgliaderived exosomes after traumatic brain injury.
Besides, exosomal miR-124-3p could suppress inflammation in neuron cells and promote neuronal growth
In addition, the protective effects of M2-EXOs in cerebrovascular disease reported by
Furthermore, Du et al. found that miR-124 could alter autophagy levels and alleviates AD pathological progression in APP/PS1 mice
Therefore, we speculate that the protective role of M2-EXOs in AD may be mediated through miR-124.
miRNA microarray analyses are warranted to identify the altered miRNA in M2-EXOs and detailed studies are needed to confirm our speculations about the specific mechanisms behind the neuroprotective effect of M2-EXOs.
