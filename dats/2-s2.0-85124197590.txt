Enhancing autophagy maturation with CCZ1-MON1A complex alleviates neuropathology and memory defects in Alzheimer disease models
Rationale: Impairment of autophagy maturation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.
However, the mechanism for this impairment has not been elucidated, and whether enhancing autophagy maturation is a viable therapeutic strategy for AD has not been verified.
Methods: We examined the autophagosome maturation process in AD cell and mouse models by immunoblotting.
To further understand the changes in autophagy in AD brains, we analyzed the transcriptome by RNA-sequencing and measured the expression of RAB7, CCZ1 and MON1A.
We performed brain stereotaxic injections of AAV into 3xTg AD mouse brain and WT mouse brain to over-express MON1A/CCZ1 or knockdown MON1A.
For in vitro studies, we purified autophagosomes, and determined GTP-RAB7 level in autophagosome fractions by GST-R7BD affinity-isolation assay.
Results: We report that the active form of RAB7 was selectively decreased in autophagosome fractions isolated from cells and tissues of AD models, and that this decrease was accompanied by impaired activity of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GFE) CCZ1-MON1A.
Overexpressing CCZ1-MON1A increased the active form of RAB7, enhanced autophagosome maturation, and promoted degradation of APP-CTFs, Aβ and P-tau in an autophagy-dependent manner in cells and a mouse AD model.
Conclusions: Our data reveals that CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 complex dysfunction is a potential mechanism for autophagosome maturation defects in AD, and advances the possibility that enhancing autophagosome maturation is a novel therapeutic strategy against AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide.
It is characterized by two main histological hallmarks: amyloid plaques composed of Aβ peptides, and

Ivyspring
International Publisher neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein
Aβ is generated through cleavage of APP by β-and γ-secretases.
APP is first cleaved by BACE1/β-secretase, which generates soluble sAPPβ and membrane-bound C99 APP-CTFβ.
Subsequently APP-CTFβ is cleaved into Aβ1-40 or Aβ1-42 by γ-secretase
Tremendous efforts have been spent on the development of therapies targeting Aβ and P-tau for AD treatment; however, these attempts have largely failed.
There is a huge need for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategy(s) to slow disease progression.
Macroautophagy (henceforth referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates the degradation of cytoplasm materials including long-lived proteins, damaged cellular organelles and aggregated or misfolded proteins
Autophagy features the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes for degradation.
It can be divided into three stages: initiation, extension, and maturation.
Massive accumulation of abnormal autophagosomes in neurons has been observed in the brains of AD patients
Furthermore, increasing evidence has revealed that disruption of the autophagy-lysosome pathway occurs very early in disease progression
Inger Lauritzen demonstrated a link between accumulating C99 and the endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal pathology.
They found that C99-mediated autophagy impairment is independent of Aβ
Similarly, Loan Vaillant-Beuchot found that APP-CTF accumulation also impaired autophagy/mitophagy as shown by the accumulation of LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62, impaired Parkin and PINK1 recruitment to mitochondria, up-regulation of membrane and matrix mitochondrial proteins, and defective fusion of mitochondria with lysosomes
However, the mechanisms underlying autophagy impairment in AD are not fully understood.
Modulation of the autophagy pathway has been recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases including AD.
Many studies have been performed to test whether enhancement of autophagy by genetic or pharmacological approaches can lead to improvement of AD phenotypes in AD models
However, autophagy is a double-edged sword in AD development, in that simply enhancing autophagosome induction without restoring the autophagosome maturation defect may have detrimental consequences for AD
A wiser strategy for modulating autophagy in AD may be specifically targeting the autophagosome maturation process.
However, the feasibility and efficacy of this strategy has not yet been verified.
RAB7 is a small GTPase required for both endosome and autophagosome maturation
CCZ1-MON1A complex is the RAB7 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which promotes the exchange of GDP-RAB7 (inactive state) to GTP-RAB7 (active state)
Krisztina Hegedus found that, in starved drosophila fat cells, autophagosomes accumulate due to impaired fusion with lysosomes upon loss of the CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 module.
They also found that CCZ1-MON1A recruits RAB7 to autophagosomes and regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion in these cells
The yeast homolog of the members of the mammalian LC3 protein (Atg8) directly binds to CCZ1 and is indeed a primary determinant to recruitment of CCZ1-MON1A to autophagosomes
Our previous research showed that overexpression of the constantly active form of RAB7 rescued autophagosome maturation defects in a cellular AD model lacking autophagy gene NRBF2.
Meanwhile, our data revealed that APP interacts and co-localizes with CCZ1 and MON1A in N2S cells
These data highlight the role of CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 in regulating autophagosome maturation for efficient degradation of AD-associated proteins.
We hence propose that the CCZ1-MON1A complex is a key determinant of autophagosome maturation in AD and that enhancing this complex's activity could be an effective approach to facilitating autophagosome maturation in AD models for the alleviation of AD pathologies.
In this paper, we report the reduction of the active form RAB7 in the autophagosome fraction isolated from cellular and mice AD models, as well as the inhibition of CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity in cellular and mice AD models.
Our results verify the effects of CCZ1-MON1A in regulating autophagosome maturation, in degrading AD-related protein, and in improving neuropathological and behavioral performance in AD models.
Our results suggest that CCZ1-MON1A, via activating autophagosome maturation, facilitates AD-related protein degradation and alleviates memory defects and neuropathological abnormalities in AD.
Our findings provide evidence that enhancement of autophagosome maturation is of potential therapeutic value in AD treatment.

Results

AD cell and mice models exhibit inhibition of autophagosome maturation
Autophagy dysfunction has been observed in the brain tissue of AD patients as well as in several AD models
To provide a comprehensive analysis of the autophagic activity in both Aβ-and P-tau-based AD models, we examined the autophagosome maturation process in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells stably expressing the human Swedish mutant APP695 (N2S cells) (Figure
We found that both LC3-II and SQSTM1 accumulation in 3xTg AD mice (Figure
Immunofluorescence staining showed massive accumulation of SQSTM1 in N2S cells.
Induction of autophagy by HBSS reduced SQSTM1 puncta effectively in N2a cells but less efficiently in N2S cells (Figure
Interestingly, almost all SQSTM1 puncta co-localized with LC3 puncta in N2S cells (Figure
The RFP-GFP-LC3 probe has been widely used to monitor autophagy flux
We used the RFP-GFP-LC3 probe to monitor autophagy flux in N2S cells and found that the number of yellow puncta (both GFP-and RFP-positive) increased (Figure
Meanwhile, we found that colocalization of autophagosome marker LC3 and lysosome marker LAMP1was decreased in N2S cells (Figure
Taken together, these findings indicate that autophagosome maturation is impaired in AD cell and mouse models.

Active form of RAB7 in autophagosome fractions and MON1A-CCZ1 GEF activity are decreased in AD cell and mice models
Our and others previous studies have revealed the critical role of RAB7 in regulating autophagosome maturation
To investigate how genes involved in the CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 complex are affected in AD, we examined their transcriptional changes in four brain regions of AD patients and controls from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) cohort (PMID)
Both MON1A (Rho = -0.19,
adj.p = 0.01) and RAB7 (Rho = -0.22,
adj.p = 0.003) mRNA expression demonstrated a negative correlation with CDR score only in the parahippocampal gyrus (BM36) which is particularly vulnerable to AD (Figure
CCZ1 expression was not significantly affected by AD in any of the four brain regions.
The data suggest progressive declines of CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity and of the active form of RAB7 might occur during the course of AD in the parahippocampal gyrus region.
To understand whether RAB7 activity is impaired in AD cell and mouse models, we applied the GST-tagged RAB7-binding domain (GST-R7BD) of RILP
We found that GST-R7BD pulled down much less GTP-RAB7 in autophagosome fractions isolated from N2S cells and from the hippocampus tissue of 3xTg AD mice, compared with that isolated from N2a cells and WT mice (Figure
Consistently, GTP beads also pulled down less GTP-RAB7 in autophagosome fractions isolated from N2S cells and hippocampus tissue of 3xTg AD mice (Figure
Interestingly, the total amount of GTP-RAB7 increased rather than decreased in N2S cells and hippocampus tissue of 3xTg mice (Figure
CCZ1-MON1A complex is the GEF for RAB7 and has been reported to interact with Atg8 (mammalian homolog LC3) and to localize on autophagosomes in yeast
We confirmed that the CCZ1-MON1 complex co-localizes with autophagosome marker LC3 in N2a cells (Figure
To understand whether reduced GTP-RAB7 on autophagosomes is due to impaired CCZ1-MON1 complex function, firstly, we determined the localization of CCZ1-MON1 complex on autophagosomes in N2S cells by confocal microscopy.
Secondly we immune-purified the CCZ1-MON1 complex from N2S cells, 3xTg mice and 5XFAD mice models to perform in vitro GEF assays
As expected, colocalization between GFP-CCZ1/GFP-MON1A and RFP-LC3 was reduced in N2S cells (Figure
Our previous work revealed that CCZ1 interacts with PIK3C3, which produces PtdIns3P to regulate autophagosome formation and maturation
PtdIns3P has been reported to recruit the CCZ1-MON1A complex to regulate RAB7 activation
We wondered whether VPS34-associated CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity was reduced in AD mouse models.
CCZ1-MON1A protein immunopurified by VPS34 antibody was used to perform the GEF assay.
From the results we can see PIK3C3-associated CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity was markedly decreased in 3xTg AD mouse brain tissue (Figure
Consistently, the CCZ1-associated PIK3C3 kinase activity is reduced in 3xTg AD mice (Figure
Collectively, the above results indicate that the active form of RAB7 (GTP-RAB7) is reduced specifically on the autophagosomes in AD cell and mice models due to impaired CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity.
Scale bar, 7.5 μm.
(K) CCZ1-MON1A protein was purified by CCZ1 antibody from N2a or N2S cells, and was then subjected to the GEF assay.
(L-M) CCZ1-MON1A protein was purified by CCZ1 antibody from hippocampus of 3xTg AD mice or 5xFAD AD mice, and was then subjected to the GEF assay.
(N) N2a cells were transiently transfected with Flag/Flag-CCZ1 and GFP-Lc3, followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Flag antibody; IP products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the corresponding antibodies.
(O-P) N2a cells and mice brain tissue lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using CCZ1 antibody, and the IP products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the LC3 and VPS34 antibodies (Q) VPS34-associated CCZ1-MON1A protein was purified by VPS34 antibody from WT or 3xTg AD mouse, then was subjected to the GEF assay.
(R) CCZ1-binding VPS34 was purified by CCZ1 antibody from WT and 3xTg AD mice brain, and was subjected to lipid kinase activity assay.

CCZ1-MON1A is activated during autophagy and positively regulates autophagosome maturation
Our data show that CCZ1-MON1A puncta partially co-localized with autophagic structures.
However, the effect of the CCZ1-MON1A complex on autophagy has not been fully explored.
By using GST-R7BD affinity-isolation assay as described previously, we found that GTP-RAB7 was significantly increased on autophagosomes in starvation-induced autophagy conditions, without affecting total RAB7 protein level (Figure
PIK3C3-associated GEF activity and CCZ1-associated VPS34 kinase activity both increased in starvation-induced autophagy conditions (Figure
More interestingly, we found that co-localization between CCZ1-MON1A and LC3 was increased in starvation-induced autophagy conditions (Figure
To understand the effect of CCZ1-MON1A on autophagy, we over-expressed CCZ1-MON1A in N2a cells and observed increased GTP-RAB7 as expected (Figure
We applied an RFP-GFP-LC3 probe to examine autophagic flux in CCZ1-MON1A over-expression cells (Figure
Compared with the empty vector group, CCZ1-MON1A over-expression led to increase of yellow puncta (Figure
To confirm the function of CCZ1-MON1A in regulating autophagic degradation in cells, we examined the levels of the autophagy substrate SQSTM1 in N2a (Figure
We found that CCZ1-MON1A over-expression significantly reduced SQSTM1 protein levels and SQSTM1 puncta in N2a and N2S cell (Figure
At the same time, we showed that over-expression of CCZ1 or MON1A alone did not affect SQSTM1 level (Figure
Finally, we confirmed that the CCZ1-MON1A over-expressionmediated degradation of SQSTM1 is dependent on autophagy as the effect can be blocked by Atg5 SiRNA transfection or CQ treatment (Figure
In addition, we knocked down (KD) MON1A expression in N2a cells by using Mon1a shRNA and found that Mon1a KD significantly decreased GTP-RAB7 level and increased LC3-II and SQSTM1 levels (Figure
Autophagosome maturation in N2a and Mon1a KD N2a cells was determined by the RFP-GFP-LC3 (Figure
The number of total puncta increased (Figure
Immunofluorescence staining showed the number of SQSTM1 puncta significantly increased in Mon1a KD N2a cells (Figure
We enhanced autophagy flux by starving cells with HBSS which enhanced the degradation of SQSTM1 in N2a cells but not in N2a KD Mon1a cells (Figure
Taken together, these results demonstrate that CCZ1-MON1A positively regulates autophagosome maturation in neuronal cells.

CCZ1-MON1A positively regulates autophagic degradation of APP-CTFs, Aβ and P-tau
To understand whether impaired CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 module function is responsible for the accumulation of AD-related protein APP-CTFs, Aβ and P-tau in AD models, we overexpressed CCZ1-MON1A complex in N2S cells.
We found that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A significantly reduced APP-CTF (Figure
Meanwhile, we examined the effect of CCZ1-MON1A over-expression on inducible HEK 293 cells expressing pTRE3G-mcherry-BI promoter-EGFP Tau P301L (HEK 293 3G-EGFP-Tau P301L/mcherry) and found that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A significantly reduced the GFP-P-tau level (Figure
To further confirm the function of CCZ1-MON1A in APP-CTFs degradation and Aβ production, we generated Mon1a knockdown (KD) N2S cell using shRNA-Mon1a (Figure
KD of Mon1a led to dramatic accumulation of APP-CTFs and Aβ in N2S cells (Figure
These results indicate that CCZ1-MON1A is an important determinant of APP-CTFs, Aβ and P-tau contents.
Interestingly, the increase of CTFs levels are more dramatic than Aβ levels in Mon1a knockdown (KD) N2S cells, suggesting that there is a difference in the fate of the two catabolites and that additional proteases may target accumulated Aβ for degradation.
To better understand how CCZ1-MON1A mediates autophagy and promotes APP-CTFs degradation, we examined whether CCZ1-MON1A would recruit APP/APP-CTFs into autophagosomes and lysosomes, as previous data showed that CCZ1-MON1A interacts with both LC3 (Figure
As the results show, the co-localization of APP/APP-CTFs with autophagosome marker LC3 and lysosome marker LAMP1 was significantly increased in CCZ1-MON1A-overexpressed cells (Figure
Interestingly, over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A significantly decreased the percentage of APP/APP-CTFs present in the RAB5-positive early endosomes while it increased distribution of APP/APP-CTFs in the RAB7-positive late endosomes (Figure
These results suggest that over-expression CCZ1-MON1A promotes recruitment of APP and APP-CTFs into autophagic-lysosome structures.

CCZ1-MON1A regulates APP-CTFs and Aβ levels through autophagy
We and others have found that enhanced autophagy promotes Aβ degradation
Our previous data showed that CCZ1-MON1A is a positive regulator of autophagy and promotes degradation of APP-CTF and Aβ.
To determine whether CCZ1-MON1A-mediated APP-CTF degradation is dependent on autophagy, we treated CCZ1-MON1A over-expression cells with chloroquine (CQ) and SAR405 to inhibit autophagy (Figure
We found that the CCZ1-MON1A over-expression-mediated reductions of APP-CTFs and Aβ were abolished by CQ and SAR405 treatment in N2S cells (Figure
Furthermore, KD of Atg5 and Atg7, two important proteins for autophagosome initiation, blocked CCZ1-MON1A over-expressioninduced APP-CTFs degradation (Figure
These results indicate that autophagy is required for CCZ1-MON1A-mediated degradation of APP-CTFs and Aβ.

AAV-mediated CCZ1-MON1A over-expression in the hippocampus alleviated autophagy impairment and AD-related behavioral and neuropathological changes in 3xTg AD mice
To confirm the effects of CCZ1-MON1A in regulating AD-related behavioral and neuropathological changes, AAV9-Flag-ccz1 /AAV9-Flag-mon1a (AAV-CM) or empty vector AAV-FLAG (AAV-VE) were stereotaxically injected into both sides of the hippocampus of 3xTg AD mice and WT C57 mice
There were nine mice in each group.
Two months after injection, the mice were subjected to spatial memory testing, and their brains were used for biochemical and neuropathological analyses.
Immunostaining of the brain slices revealed that injection of the virus into the DG regions led to highly restricted hippocampal expression (Figure
The Morris water maze test (MWM)
The 3xTg AD mice receiving AAV-CM injections travelled a significantly shorter time to find the hidden platform compared with those receiving AAV-Flag treatment, while WT mice receiving AAV-CM injections did not display any alternation in the time to find the hidden platform (Figure
In the probe trial, the CM-AAV-injected 3xTg AD mice spent a significantly greater percentage of time in the target quadrant when compared to the vehicle-treated 3xTg mice (Figure
While the CM-AAV-injected WT mice showed the similar time spent in the target quadrant compared to the vehicle-treated WT mice (Figure
We next investigated short-term memory using the Y-maze text
3xTg AD mice receiving CM-AAV injection more frequently entered the novel arm and spent more time there (Figure
These results suggest that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A in the hippocampus selectively improved cognitive function of 3xTg AD mice.
Anxiety is one of the clinical features of AD patients, and 3xTg AD mice also display anxious behavior
We used an open field test to test whether CCZ1-MON1A over-expression might exert anxiolytic effects.
We found that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A significantly increased the time in the center area (Figure
This data suggested that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A decreased anxiety in 3xTg AD mice.
Next, we examined autophagy status.
We found that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A significantly increased the protein level of LC3-II and reduced SQSTM1 level in 3xTg AD mice and WT mice (Figure
Furthermore, over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A decreased the levels of FL-APP, APP-CTFs (Figure
The levels of phosphorylated tau (S205/T202, S214, T181) also dramatically decreased in CCZ1-MON1A over-expression mice.
(Figure
Conversely, AAV-mediated Mon1a KD exacerbated autophagy impairment in 3xTg AD mice, and AD-related behavioral and neuropathological changes in 3xTg AD mice.
AAV-GFP-sh-Mon1a injection aggravated the spatial memory impairment and anxiety as shown by the MWM, Y-maze and open field test results (Figure
The injection also inhibited autophagy as evidenced by accumulation of LC3 and SQSTM1 (Figure

Discussion
Accumulating evidence implicates autophagiclysosomal pathway dysregulation in AD
Consistent with this evidence, our findings reported here showed that LC3-II and p62 accumulated in multiple cellular and animal models of AD (Figure
Furthermore, our data reveals, for the first time, that the CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 module is impaired in AD models, suggesting a novel pathogenic mechanism for autophagosome maturation inhibition.
We showed that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A enhanced autophagosome maturation, promoted APP-CTFs, Aβ and P-tau degradation, and alleviated memory defects and neuropathology in AD models.
This study highlights the critical role of the CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 module in the regulation of neuronal autophagy to maintain neuron homeostasis and counteract neurodegeneration.
The CCZ1-MON1A complex is a RAB7 GEF which promotes the transformation of GDP-RAB7 (inactive state) into GTP-RAB7 (active state).
RAB7 plays a key role in endosome and autophagosome maturation by promoting vesicle transportation
RAB7 is required for the transfer of the cargo from late endosomes to lysosomes, and RAB7 is activated by the CCZ1-MON1A complex on late endosomes and it dissociates from lysosomes in mammalian cells
CCZ1 directly interacts with Atg8 to become localized on autophagosomes
However, the role of CCZ1-MON1A in the regulation of autophagy in mammals is still unclear.
Here, our results show that, in neuronal cells and mouse brains, CCZ1-MON1A over-expression increased the active form of RAB7 and promoted autophagosome maturation, while Mon1a depletion blocked autophagosome maturation.
Our previous study found that APP interacts with CCZ1, and the interaction may contribute to the redistribution of APP and APP-CTF in neuronal cells.
Indeed, over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A increased the recruitment of APP/APP-CTFs to autophagosomes and lysosomes, and this phenomenon was more obvious after CQ treatment.
These data indicate that CCZ1-MON1A, by generating an active form of RAB7, plays a key role in regulating autophagosome maturation.
Interestingly, over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A attenuated Aβ and tau pathology in cellular and mice models of AD, and alleviated memory impairment in 3xTg AD mice.
The results suggest that CCZ1-MON1A is a critical factor in the regulation of Aβ and tau pathology, as well as in memory in AD.
However, further study is needed to clarify whether CCZ1-MON1A exerts anti-AD effects mainly through autophagy or whether other mechanisms are involved.
Abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes can be observed in AD animal models and AD patients, implying the interruption of autophagosome maturation
Several mechanisms have been found to be responsible for the impaired autophagosome maturation, including lysosomal inhibition.
Though enhancement of autophagy has been regarded as a therapeutic strategy against AD, simply activating autophagosome biogenesis may be problematic as it will lead to autophagosome accumulation when maturation is inhibited.
How to selectively restore impaired autophagosome maturation is still an unsolved problem.
By revealing the impaired CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity in AD models and showing that over-expression of CCZ1-MON1A promoted autophagosome maturation and alleviated autophagic substrates accumulation in cellular and mice models of AD, we show that modulation of CCZ1-MON1A expression or CCZ1-MON1A GEF activity can be an approach to restoring autophagosome maturation in AD.
A further task would be to identify small molecule CCZ1-MON1A activator(s) for therapeutic applications.
In summary, our study revealed the dysregulation of CCZ1-MON1A-RAB7 in AD models, and showed that CCZ1-MON1A is the positive regulator of autophagosome maturation for efficient clearance of APP-CTF, Aβ and P-tau in AD models.
Our work thus establishes an important link between CCZ1-MON1A dysfunction, autophagosome maturation impairment and AD development.
More broadly, our study results support the concept that enhancing autophagosome maturation might be a viable therapeutic strategy against AD.
