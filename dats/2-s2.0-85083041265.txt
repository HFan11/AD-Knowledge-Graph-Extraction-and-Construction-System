Microarray analysis of verbenalin-treated human amniotic epithelial cells reveals therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a major world health problem as the population ages.
There is still no available treatment that can stop or reverse the progression of AD.
Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), an alternative source for stem cells, have shown neuroprotective and neurorestorative potentials when transplanted in vivo.
Besides, studies have suggested that stem cell priming with plant-derived bioactive compounds can enhance stem cell proliferation and differentiation and improve the disease-treating capability of stem cells.
Verbenalin is an iridoid glucoside found in medicinal herbs of Verbenaceae family.
In the present study, we have conducted microarray gene expression profiling of verbenalin-treated hAECs to explore its therapeutic potential for AD.
Gene set enrichment analysis revealed verbenalin treatment significantly enriched AD-associated gene sets.
Genes associated with lysosomal dysfunction, pathologic angiogenesis, pathologic protein aggregation, circadian rhythm, age-related neurometabolism, and neurogenesis were differentially expressed in the verbenalin-treated hAECs compared to control cells.
Additionally, the neuroprotective effect of verbenalin was confirmed against amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
Our present study is the first to report the therapeutic potential of verbenalin for AD; however, further indepth research in the in vitro and in vivo models are required to confirm our preliminary findings.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder accounting for at least twothirds of cases of dementia in people aged 65 and over.
AD is characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive function and memory
Although increasing age is the most important known risk factor for AD, a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors also contribute to the pathologic progress of AD
With a rapidly aging world population, AD has become a major health problem in both developed and developing nations.
Globally in 2016, the prevalence of AD and other dementias was estimated to be 43.8 million, with 2.4 million deaths making AD and dementia the fifthlargest cause of death.
It is projected that by 2050, the number of people living with AD and dementia would AGING be over 100 million
Currently, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are the only medicines approved in the US and Europe; however, they only provide short-term improvement of AD symptoms for a short period of six to eighteen months.
There are more than 100 compounds under investigation for the possible treatment of AD
Continuing efforts are still required to develop medicines as well as novel, practical strategies that would slow the progression, halt, or prevent AD and other dementias and recover cognitive functions.
Current advances in stem-cell-based therapies or approaches, such as the promotion of endogenous neurogenesis, transplantation of exogenous stem cells, etc. have shed light on novel treatment strategies of AD
However, the high cost, time-consuming, and labor-intensive nature of stem cell therapy limit its use.
And therefore, identification of a suitable stem cell source with therapeutic applications has become a top priority.
Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), isolated from a medical waste product such as discarded term placenta, are gaining interest as a new alternative source of stem cells as they have similar pluripotent and multipotent properties of stem cells.
Moreover, they have the further advantage over embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), such as they are readily available, they do not form teratomas in vivo, have low immunogenicity and low rejection rate, have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and pose far fewer ethical concerns
Evidences have shown that hAECs can cross the bloodbrain barrier where they can engraft and survive for up to 60 days, and eventually can promote the survival and regeneration of neurons, synthesize and release neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters, and reestablish the damaged neural connections, suggesting that hAECs may be one of the most promising candidates for cell-based therapy of neurological diseases
Recent advanced researches on plant extracts and their bioactive compounds are bringing into light their importance in regenerative medicine.
In this regard, several priming approaches using natural compounds have been proposed in recent years to activate stem cells for proliferation and differentiation and to improve the survival, function, and therapeutic efficacy of stem cells
Moreover, recent evidence shows that the outcome of stem cell therapy in neurodegenerative diseases can be improved through the combination of adjunct treatments
Natural compounds of dietary origin, known as nutraceuticals, would be promising candidates to produce synergistic effects with stem cell therapy.
Several studies have already suggested the protective properties of natural compounds against age-related neurodegenerative diseases
Therefore, in vitro enrichment or preconditioning of stem cells in the presence of a specific plant extract or its pharmacologically active substance can open a new horizon for regenerative medicine and treatment; however, exploration of the strategies in this regard has been sparse.
Verbenalin is an iridoid glucoside found in medicinal herb Verbena officinalis (V.
officinalis) and other plants of the Verbenaceae family, such as Lippia citriodora
The plant V. officinalis, also known as "holy plant", is native to Europe and the Mediterranean region.
Herbal tea made from V. officinalis has traditionally been used for the treatment of insomnia as well as a home remedy for headache, fever, depression, and nervous exhaustion.
Verbenalin, one of the major constituents of this plant, has been reported to exhibit sleep-promoting and antioxidant activities
In our previous study, we have reported relaxation and anti-depressant effects of lemon verbena (Lippia citriodora) extract, rich in verbascoside and verbenalin, both in the in vitro and in vivo models
In the present study, we have treated hAECs with verbenalin for seven days and conducted microarray analysis to investigate the changes in gene expression and to explore its therapeutic potential for AD.
Additionally, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of verbenalin against amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

RESULTS

Characteristics of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
In the present study, control hAEC spheroids were maintained in the placental basal medium, and the treatment hAEC spheroids were treated with 20 μM of verbenalin for seven days.
The effective concentration of verbenalin on hAEC was determined using the mitochondrial-dependent reduction of 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Supplementary Figure
Microarray analysis was conducted on three biological replicates of day 7 (d7) control and treatment samples, and two biological replicates of day 0 (d0) control samples.
Genes satisfy both p-value <0.05 (one-way betweensubjects ANOVA) and fold-change (in linear space) > 1.1 criteria simultaneously were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and were included for gene ontology (GO) analysis.
We found a total of 383 unique genes were consistently differentially expressed in all three replicates of verbenalin-treated cells and were considered as DEGs AGING for further analysis.
Among the DEGs, 137 genes were upregulated, and 246 genes were downregulated.
Figure
The red dots represent the significantly upregulated genes, and the green dots represent the significantly downregulated genes.
There were several genes which showed large relative differences, or fold changes, however, the fold changes were not consistent among the replicates, thus, were not included for further analysis (Figure
Figure
Most of the DEGs (80%) showed fold change <1.4,
probably because we did not add any supplement other than verbenalin in the treated cells.
For the GO analysis, we have included all the genes with fold change >1.1 (and, p<0.05) to explore the molecular changes which might be small in magnitude but are consistent.
Tissue expression analysis by the 'functional annotation' tool of DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) software revealed that 49% of DEGs were brain-specific (Figure
Further analysis of brain-specific DEGs showed that 34% genes were previously reported to be expressed in pons (n= 131), 23% in medulla oblongata (n= 90), 21% in parietal lobe (n= 82), and 20% in subthalamic nucleus (n= 75).
Gene family analysis of the DEGs revealed 25 genes were transcription factors (TFs), 11 were protein kinases, and seven were growth factors.
Top 20 significantly upregulated and downregulated genes and their related GO have been listed in Supplementary Tables

Several signaling pathways, namely ErbB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and calcium signaling pathways, as well as pathways in cancer, were significantly overrepresented.
Other significantly enriched signaling pathways include regulation of actin cytoskeleton, adherens junction, axon guidance, and dorsoventral axis.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) reveals regulation of AD-related gene sets
Table
Gene sets were identified using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) of GSEA.
Interestingly, we found that 44 DEGs were overlapped with the gene set that is upregulated in the brain from patients with AD (p=1.31 e -12 ).
We also found that 29 DEGs were overlapped with the gene set that is downregulated in the brain from AD patients (p=1.02 e -7 )
Neurogenesis-, neuron differentiation-, and nervous system development-associated gene sets were also highly enriched.

Verbenalin treatment regulated AD-associated genes in hAECs
We found that a total of 73 AD-associated genes were regulated in the verbenalin-treated hAECs, among which 44 were reported to be upregulated (termed as 'group A' genes), whereas 29 genes were reported to be downregulated (termed as 'group B' genes) in the brain from patients with AD
In the verbenalin-treated hAECs, 32 'group A' genes were downregulated, and 12 were upregulated.
Figure
Seven genes of this 'group A' genes were previously reported to be upregulated at the incipient stage of AD, namely TAO Kinase 2 (TAOK2), Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 2 (CPT2), Tumor Protein D52 (TPD52), Interferon, Alpha 5 (IFNA5), Transmembrane Protein 8A (TMEM8A), Family with Sequence Similarity 3, Member A (FAM3A), and Rho GTPase Activating Protein (ARHGAP) 17 (ARHGAP 17), all of which were downregulated in the treatment cells.
Several transcription factors were among the 'group A' genes, such as Cut-Like Homeobox 1 (CUX1), Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group F, Member 6 (NR2F6), SERTA Domain Containing 2 (SERTAD2), TATA-Box Binding Protein Associated Factor (TAF) 11 (TAF11), TAF15, Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 (TCF7L1), Trichorhinophalangeal Syndrome I (TRPS1), and Upstream Transcription Factor 2 (USF2).
Among the 'group B' genes, 25 were downregulated, and four were upregulated in the verbenalin-treated cells.
Further analysis of these 25 genes showed overlap with the genes associated with 'cell death' (n=6), 'genes whose expression significantly and positively correlated with the density of calbindin-containing gamma-Aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons from prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9 (BA9) brain region) across all subjects with psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia' (n=10)
We also found 11 genes of 'group B' were reported to be strongly associated with late-onset of AD
When compared with d0 control, d7 verbenalintreated hAECs showed a better effect on AD-associated genes than d7 untreated control hAECS.
Several genes (n = 22) associated with interactions of pathological hallmark proteins tubulin polymerization promoting protein/P25, β-amyloid, and α-synuclein
List of ADassociated genes and their fold changes compared with d0 and d7 controls is given in the Supplementary Table

Verbenalin treatment regulated the gene expression of the receptors of the ErbB pathway
The dysregulation of ErbB signaling in humans is associated with the development of AD.
In the AGING microarray analysis, we found that verbenalin treatment significantly downregulated the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) (fold change -1.41), and vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) (fold change -1.89).
On the other hand, the expression of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) was significantly upregulated (fold change 1.34).
A similar gene expression result was found in the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis (Figure
Although not significant, EGFR and NRG1 showed similar protein expression patterns as gene expression (Figure
However, VEGF showed a slight upregulation in protein expression (Figure
NRG1 is the first discovered member of the NRG family that contains the EGF-like domain.
NRGs and related EGF-domain containing proteins interact with different receptor tyrosine kinases of the ERBB family (ERBB1-4) and initiate intracellular signaling pathways in a specific way.
NRG1 is the direct ligand for ERBB3 and ERBB4
tyrosine kinase receptors, and concomitantly recruits ERBB1 and ERBB2 coreceptors, resulting in ligandstimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the ERBB receptors.
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) that acts as a mediator of ERBB2-dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex was downregulated (fold change -1.13).

Verbenalin treatment regulated expression of genes of Rho family GTPases
The Rho GTPases belong to the Ras superfamily of small (molecular weight ~21kDa) guanine nucleotidebinding proteins (G-proteins).
The most extensively studied members of the Rho family are Ras Homolog Family Member A (RHOA), Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), and cell division cycle 42 (CDC42).
We found that verbenalin treatment significantly downregulated the expression of several ARHGAP21 functions as the GTPase activator for RHOA and CDC42, ARHGAP17 for CDC42, and ARHGAP19 for RHOA.
We also found the downregulation of family with sequence similarity 65, member B (FAM65B), an inhibitor of the small GTPase RhoA (fold change -1.93).
Additionally, pleckstrin homology domain-containing family G member 6 (PLEKHG6), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor activating the small GTPase RhoA, was also downregulated (fold change -1.38).

Verbenalin treatment regulated genes associated with circadian entrainment
Circadian entrainment is the biological process by which endogenous oscillations are synchronized with external cues, such as daily light and temperature cycles, within a period of ~24 h.
The circadian clock coordinates the daily molecular, hormonal, physiological, and behavioral rhythms.
We found several genes associated with circadian rhythm were downregulated in the verbenalin-treated hAECs, such as TFs NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1; fold change -1.13) and retinoic acid-induced protein 1 (RAI1; fold change -1.13), imprinted gene GNAS complex locus (GNAS; fold change -1.27), and G protein beta polypeptide 1 (GNB1; fold change -1.19).
Although not specific, there was also the downregulation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel CACNA1C (fold change -1.13) and Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) II gamma (CAMK2G; fold change -2.07) in the verbenalin-treated cells.

Verbenalin treatment showed neuroprotective effects against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells
As unexpectedly, our study results showed that verbenalin treatment could significantly regulate AD- AGING associated genes in hAECs, we investigated its neuroprotective effects against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells.
The human SH-SY5Y cell line is a widely-used cellular model to examine the toxic effects of amyloid peptides.
We found that verbenalin was nontoxic up to the concentration of 20 μM (Figure
Therefore, 20 μM of verbenalin was used for determining its effects on Aβ-induced neuronal cell damage.
When SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to 5 μM of Aβ for 72 h, there was significant cell death compared with untreated controls (Figure
However, in cultures pre-treated with 20 μM of verbenalin for 24 h (Figure

Verbenalin treatment significantly ameliorated the Aβ-induced decline of ATP levels in SH-SY5Y cells
Figure
Exposure to 5 µM of Aβ for 24 h resulted in a significant decrease in ATP production compared to control cells.
However, pretreatment with verbenalin for 24 h could rescue the reduction of ATP production in Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells (p < 0.01).

Verbenalin treatment attenuated Aβ-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SH-SY5Y cells
The effect of verbenalin treatment on oxidative stress was detected by testing the level of intracellular ROS. Figure
When the cells were pretreated with 20 μM of verbenalin for 24 h, ROS production was decreased compared to only Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y Cells (p = 0.44), suggesting the preventive effect of verbenalin against Aβ-induced oxidative stress.
However, the changes did not achieve statistical significance.

Verbenalin treatment regulated the expressions of EGFR, VEGF, and NRG1 in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells
We investigated how verbenalin treatment could modulate the expressions of EGFR, VEGF, and NRG1 in Aβ-induced neurotoxic condition.

EGFR and NRG1 showed similar protein expression patterns as gene expression (Figure

DISCUSSION
AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease overlaid with neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms
The current pharmacologic therapy for AD only provides short term alleviation of symptoms.
In recent years, hAECs and alternative sources of adult stem cells have been gaining interest in regenerative medicine for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
Xue et al., have reported that intracerebroventricular transplantation of hAEC in the transgenic AD model mice could improve cognitive functions, and increase acetylcholine levels and the number of hippocampal neurites
Another study has reported that intravenous injection of human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells in transgenic AD mouse models improved AD pathology and memory function through regulating oxidative stress
With advances in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, it is reasonable to construct new approaches that may improve the treatment options.
Recently, plant extracts

AGING
and their bioactive compounds have received considerable attention because of their distinct pharmacology profiles, such as the rapid onset of action, less side effect profile, potential drug synergies, and most importantly because of their ability to improve proliferation, differentiation and therapeutic efficacy of stem cells
On the other hand, microarray gene expression profiling is a useful tool to explore genome-wide expression patterns that are activated during studied biological conditions and provides a foundation for further examination of molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways.
Therefore, in the present study, we conducted a microarray analysis of the gene expression pattern of verbenalin-treated hAECs to explore its health beneficial potentials.
The study results revealed that verbenalin treatment could significantly enrich the priori-defined ADassociated gene sets (Table
Most importantly, we found that verbenalin treatment could significantly downregulate the expression of EGFR, which is thought to play the central role in the neuronal and metabolic interaction during the aging process.
Several studies have demonstrated the role of EGFR in neurometabolic pathophysiology, aging-related metabolic activity, as well as age-related neuronal survival and regeneration
On the other hand, there was significant upregulation of NRG1, a member of growth and differentiation factor containing EGF-like signaling domain.
NRG1 is reported to attenuate cognitive function impairments in mice model of AD via inducing neurogenesis
Importantly, NRG1 and other EGFlike proteins interact with receptor tyrosine kinases of the ERBB family and initiate specific intracellular signaling pathways
We also found significant downregulation of several ARHGAPs in verbenalintreated hAECs, which may contribute to inhibition of tyrosine kinases
Therefore, the NRG1/ErbB and EGFR/ErbB signaling pathways need to be carefully investigated to confirm the AD-preventing potential of verbenalin in hAECs.
Additionally, VEGFB, the growth factor for endothelial cells, was downregulated in verbenalin-treated hAECs.
VEGF is the central component of pathological blood vessel formation, and it was reported that EGFR and ERBB2 signaling pathway plays an essential role in VEGF regulation in carcinoma cells
Postmortem studies on human brains found evidence of increased angiogenesis in the hippocampus, mid-frontal cortex, and other parts of AD brains compared to healthy individuals
The amalgamation of accumulated Aβ and neuroinflammation causes diminished blood perfusion of the brain, leading to hypoperfusion/hypoxia-induced angiogenesis through the upregulation of several proangiogenic factors, particularly VEGF
Another important TF that was downregulated in verbenalin-treated hAECs is NR2F6 (fold change -1.54), also known as eosinophil cationic protein 2 (EAR2).
Ear2 deletion was reported to cause early memory and learning deficits in APP/PS1 mice through degeneration of locus ceruleus (LC) and noradrenaline deficiency in AD
It has also been reported that abnormal development of LC in Ear2 deficient mice leads to impaired forebrain clock and affects circadian rhythm
Along with NR2F6, we found several other genes of circadian entrainment were up/downregulated in the verbenalin-treated hAECs, such as GNAS, GNB1, NKX2-1, and RAI1.
It has been reported that loss of imprinting of Gnas leads to enhancement of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and complex cognitive processes, and inhibition of rapid eye movement (REM) and REM-linked behaviors
GNB1 is a G-protein that is differentially expressed on a night/day basis in the pineal gland
The pineal gland plays a vital role in vertebrate chronobiology by converting time into a hormonal signal and melatonin.
NKX2-1 is a TF that activates the transcription of the GnRH receptor and plays a role in enhancing the circadian oscillation
RAI1 is the transcriptional regulator of the circadian clock components.
It positively regulates the transcriptional activity of CLOCK, a core component of the circadian clock, through chromatin remodeling by interacting with other proteins in chromatin as well as proteins in the basic transcriptional machinery
Previous studies have already reported the sleeppromoting effect of verbenalin
Synchronizing circadian rhythms may be an inexpensive way to promote healthy aging and delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD
Other top downregulated AD-associated genes include TMEM8A, USF2, PDZ and LIM domain 4 (PDLIM4), and TAF15 (Supplementary Table
Lysosomal protein TMEM8A is a hallmark for lysosomal dysfunction and is associated with recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorders
However, there is increasing evidence that lysosomes play a central role in the pathogenesis of common neurodegenerative diseases
Nixon et al. identified cathepsins in amyloid-β plaques, confirming the broad dysfunction of the lysosomal system in AD
In our study, we found that verbenalin treatment could significantly downregulate the expression of Cathepsin D (CTSD; fold change -1.51), a suggested therapeutic target for AD
USFs are essential genes that tie cholesterol metabolism and AD together.
USFs regulate genes associated with synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival, and differentiation.
Additionally,
USF1 regulates lipid metabolism genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE) and amyloid precursor protein (APP).
APOE and APP are the most commonly accepted risk genes for early onset of AD, suggesting the involvement of lipid metabolism disorder in AD progression.
TAF15 is an RNA binding protein (RBP) and is reported to colocalize with tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases
We also found downregulation of heat shock protein gene (heat shock 27kDa protein 1; fold change -1.31) in the verbenalintreated cells, which is also reported to be associated with pathologic protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases
Additionally, significantly upregulated annotation terms by the DEGs in verbenalin-treated hAECS include 'positive regulation of protein localization (GO: 1904951)', and 'positive regulation of protein metabolic process (GO: 0051247)'.
Significantly downregulated annotation terms include 'protein complex binding (GO: 0032403, number of DEGs = 22)', 'ribonucleotide binding (GO: 0032553, number of DEGs = 30)', and 'cytoskeletal protein binding (GO: 0008092, number of DEGs = 16)'.
These findings suggest the regulation of RBPs in verbenalin-treated cells, which may affect pathologic protein aggregation.
Heat maps for relative expression intensity (Figure
Verbenalin treatment could significantly downregulate those AD-associated gene expressions in hAECs.
The expression intensities of the genes associated with AD in both verbenalin-treated and untreated (d7 control) hAECs were compared with d0 control hAECs (Figure
The findings suggest that verbenalin treatment had a significant effect on neurodegenerative disease-associated genes compared to untreated hAECs.
As verbenalin treatment could modulate AD-associated genes in hAECs, we further investigated its effect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to confirm its neuroprotective properties (Figures
We found that pretreatment with 20 μM of verbenalin for 24 h could significantly reduce the Aβ-induced cell death (Figure
Although the underlying molecular mechanism of AD is still unclear, mitochondrial degeneration and oxidative stress are suggested to be the early triggering factors of AD pathophysiology
Defective mitochondria inhibit the production of ATP and increase the production of ROS.
Accumulation of ROS eventually induces oxidative damage.
Thus, pharmacological inhibition of ROS generation and activation of ATP production has been considered as feasible therapeutic strategies for AD.
We found that verbenalin could significantly ameliorate the Aβinduced decline of ATP levels (Figure
We also investigated how verbenalin treatment could modulate the expressions of EGFR, VEGF, and NRG1 in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.
Increased EGFR activity has been linked to the Aβinduced memory loss, a hallmark of AD progression.
Wang et al., have reported that EGFR inhibitors are capable of rescuing the Aβ-induced memory loss in both transgenic fruit fly and transgenic mouse models and have suggested that inhibition of Aβ-induced EGFR activation might be an effective way to treat Aβ-induced memory loss in AD.
We found that verbenalin treatment could downregulate Aβ-induced EGFR expression.
We also found that verbenalin could significantly upregulate NRG1 expression in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.
NRG1 is widely expressed in the adult human brain
Although it is not clear yet how Aβ aggregation affects NRG1 expression in the AD brain, it is evident that NRG1 has therapeutic potential for AD by inducing neurogenesis, improving cognitive deficits, and restoring synaptic plasticity with
The angiogenic factor VEGF is implicated in pathological angiogenesis in the AD brain
The exogenous addition of VEGF can partially rescue the anti-angiogenic effect of Aβ peptides in vitro
Another interesting study by Garcia and colleagues
In our study, we found that verbenalin treatment significantly reduced VEGF expression in hAECs (Figure
Therefore, the effect of verbenalin on VEGF requires to be evaluated in in vivo condition.
One of the advantages of plant-derived natural compounds is that they contain multiple agents that can target multiple pathologies simultaneously, therefore, are found more efficacious than the traditional drugs when faced with complex disease conditions, such as AD.
Our study suggests that verbenalin treatment in hAECs may improve its therapeutic potential to AD through modulating the gene expression related to neurometabolic aging, lysosomal dysfunction, pathological angiogenesis, pathological protein aggregation, and circadian rhythms.
We have also found that verbenalin could significantly reduce cell death, AGING ameliorate the decline of ATP levels, inhibit the ROS generation and EGFR expression, and upregulate NRG1 expression in Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.
As verbenalin treatment could significantly regulate ADassociated genes in hAECs compared to untreated hAECs, it may provide new treatment modalities for neurodegenerative diseases, such as transplantation of verbenalin-treated hAECs, or combination use of hAEC transplantation/systemic administration and oral administration of verbenalin.
Future evidence-studies are required to evaluate the afore-mentioned neuroprotective properties of verbenalin systematically.
In conclusion, given the increase in AD prevalence, diverse studies are needed to explore the therapeutic potentials of nature-derived compounds.
Even small measurable differences in cognition, behavior, and functioning may become clinically significant to prevent, halt, or cure progressive neurodegenerative diseases.
Pretreatment of hAECs or other adult stem cells in the presence of a certain plant extract or its pharmacologically active substance can open a new horizon in regenerative medicine in AD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Amnion epithelial cells extraction and culture
The detailed methodology has been explained elsewhere
Briefly, AECs were isolated from the delivered term placenta of the mothers who underwent cesarean delivery.
The amnion was separated from the chorion manually and was washed with 200 mL of Hank's Basic Salt Solution -Calcium and Magnesium Free (CMF-HBSS) and then was cut into smaller pieces using surgical scissors.
AECs were maintained in Placenta Epithelial Cell Basal Medium (PromoCell, Cat.
# C-26140).
The medium was changed every 2-4 days.
To subculture AECs, the plates were first washed twice with 10 mL of PBS, and then 3 mL of pre-digestion buffer (pre-warmed to 37°C) was added to the plate.
After incubation at 37°C for 5 minutes, five mL of 0.05% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (pre-warmed to 37°C) was added to the plate and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes.
Five mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) was added to stop the reaction.
The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 200 RPM for 4 minutes at 4°C twice.
After centrifuge, the supernatant was discarded each time, and the cells were suspended in the placental basal medium.

Preparation of 3D culture plates, spheroid formation, and compound supplement
We used a 3D culture plate (ElplasiaTM, Kuraray Co., Ltd., Cat # RB 500 400 NA 24) for the study.
Lipidure TM (NOF Corporation, Cat.
# CMS206; 400 μL) solution was placed into each well of the 3D plate at the concentration of 50 mg in 10 mL absolute ethanol.
After two minutes, the Lipidure TM solution was aspirated out, and the plate was dried for 3 hours.
Then 400 μL of PBS was placed in each well.
The plate was centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 minutes at room temperature.
The PBS was then discarded, and the wells were washed twice with 400 μL of PBS.
The plates were then stored in the cell culture incubator until use.
Spheroids were formed by seeding 1 × 10 6 AECs in Placenta Basal Epithelial Cell Medium into each well of the 24-well plate.
The initial culture was maintained for 24 hours.
Control samples for d 0 were collected before adding the treatment.
For the treatment samples, the medium was changed with 20 μM of verbenalin (Sigma-Aldrich, Japan) every 48 hours for three times.
Control samples were maintained in the Placental medium, which was also changed in every 48 hours.
Finally, the treatment and control samples were collected from a one-week culture.

RNA extraction and quantification
RNA was extracted using Isogen (Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Toyama, Japan) kit following the manufacturer's guide.
NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) was used to quantify the integrity of RNA.

Affymetrix microarray gene expression
We conducted Affymetrix microarray gene expression profiling using GeneChip® 3' Expression Arrays and 3' IVT PLUS Reagent Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
We used 250 ng of total RNA from each sample to generate amplified and biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) from poly (A) RNA in a total RNA sample following the users' manual.
Human Genome U219 array strips (HG-U219) were hybridized for 16 hours in a 45°C incubator, washed and stained.
Imaging was conducted in the GeneAtlas Fluidics and Imaging Station.
Each HG-U219 array strip is comprised of more than 530,000 probes, which cover approximately 36,000 transcripts and variants and represent more than 20,000 unique genes.

Microarray data processing and analysis
Expression Console Software (provided by the Affymetrix) was used to normalize the raw data following the robust multichip average (RMA) algorithm (
Subsequent analysis of the gene expression data was carried out in the freely available Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) version 4 (Thermofisher Inc.).
In this present study, we have AGING considered both fold changes and variability of gene expression for the identification of DEGs.
Raw fold change between two experimental conditions does not take the variance of gene expression among the replicates into account.
Therefore, it does not provide statistical confidence that the genes will show similar fold-change threshold in future experiments.
Therefore, we defined DEGs as the genes that satisfy both p-value <0.05 (oneway between-subjects ANOVA) and fold-change (in linear space) > 1.1 criteria simultaneously.
MSigDB of GSEA was used to determine whether a priori-defined set of genes shows statistically significant and concordant differences between two biological states, i.e., verbenalintreated versus non-treated control (
MSigDB emphasizes a genomic, unbiased approach to define the gene sets, which are curated from published expression profiles and allows researchers to evaluate microarray data at the level of gene sets, which tend to be more reproducible and more interpretable.
Gene annotation, tissue expression, and pathway analysis for the DEGs were conducted using an online data mining tool DAVID ver.

A serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (Opti-MEM) (Gibco, Japan) was used to culture the cells for the neuroprotection assay.
The neuroprotective activity was determined by the MTT reduction assay.
SH-SY5Y cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 10 4 cells/well in the 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h.
The cells were pre-incubated with 20 µM verbenalin in Opti-MEM for 24 h and then were subjected to treatment with 5 µM Aβ and the sample for 24 h.
The treated medium was replaced with 100 μL of Opti-MEM in the absence of verbenalin and Aβ.
Subsequently, 10 μL of MTT (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) dissolved in PBS (-) at 5 mg/mL was added into the medium.
After overnight incubation at 37 °C, 100 μL of 10% SDS (w/v) was added and incubated until the formazan product dissolved.
