The Expression and Localisation of G-Protein-Coupled Inwardly Rectifying Potassium (GIRK) Channels Is Differentially Altered in the Hippocampus of Two Mouse Models of Alzheimer’s Disease
G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK) channels are the main targets controlling excitability and synaptic plasticity on hippocampal neurons.
Consequently, dysfunction of GIRKmediated signalling has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer s disease (AD).
Here, we provide a quantitative description on the expression and localisation patterns of GIRK2 in two transgenic mice models of AD (P301S and APP/PS1 mice), combining histoblots and immunoelectron microscopic approaches.
The histoblot technique revealed differences in the expression of GIRK2 in the two transgenic mice models.
The expression of GIRK2 was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of P301S mice in a laminar-specific manner at 10 months of age but was unaltered in APP/PS1 mice at 12 months compared to age-matched wild type mice.
Ultrastructural approaches using the pre-embedding immunogold technique, demonstrated that the subcellular localisation of GIRK2 was significantly reduced along the neuronal surface of CA1 pyramidal cells, but increased in its frequency at cytoplasmic sites, in both P301S and APP/PS1 mice.
We also found a decrease in plasma membrane GIRK2 channels in axon terminals contacting dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal cells in P301S and APP/PS1 mice.
These data demonstrate for the first time a redistribution of GIRK channels from the plasma membrane to intracellular sites in different compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells.
Altogether, the pre-and post-synaptic reduction of GIRK2 channels suggest that GIRK-mediated alteration of the excitability in pyramidal cells could contribute to the cognitive dysfunctions as described in the two AD animal models.

Introduction
G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK) channels are a family of ion channels functionally coupled to PTX-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which generate slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
Therefore, major roles of GIRK channels in the CNS are to mediate inhibitory responses by hyperpolarising neuronal membranes and decreasing neuronal excitability
As downstream effectors of many GPCRs that use the G i/o family of G proteins are known to be involved in >many physiological and pathological processes
Consequently, GIRK channels are now postulated as novel therapeutic targets for the development of new pharmacotherapies
The mammalian GIRK family includes four subunits (GIRK1, GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4) encoded by KCNJ3, KCNJ6, KCNJ9, and KCNJ5 genes, respectively
GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK3 are widely expressed in the CNS, whereas the expression of GIRK4 is generally lacking in the brain, with a few exceptions
These subunits combine to form homomeric and heteromeric channels
Thus, the prototypical functional GIRK channel in the brain consists primarily of GIRK1 and GIRK2, as the genetic ablation of either of these subunits reduces the size of somato-dendritic GIRK currents in many neuron types
Additionally, GIRK1 and GIRK2 can be co-immunoprecipitated, showed the same subcellular localisation patterns, and in regions where these subunits are co-expressed, the disruption of GIRK2 significantly reduces the expression of GIRK1
GIRK channels are highly expressed in brain regions associated with learning and memory, including the hippocampus
The hippocampus is one of the brain regions firstly affected in AD, a disease characterised by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), containing amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and phospho-tau respectively, as well as synapse loss
Using experimental models that reproduce some of these major neuropathological hallmarks in AD, previous studies have reported that Aβ induces a reduction in gene expression of hippocampal GIRK channel subunits and decreases GIRK conductance in pyramidal cells
However, it remains unclear the role played by tau in GIRK channel expression and localisation.
Information regarding how GIRK channels reorganise at the surface of hippocampal neurons in AD and the neuronal pathways that are primarily affected is essential to understand the pathogenesis of the disease.
For this purpose, we aim in this study to elucidate the protein levels and subcellular localisation of the GIRK2 subunit in the hippocampus of the P301S and APP/PS1 mouse models of tau pathology and Aβ pathology, respectively.
Here we provide convincing evidence for a significant reduction in the expression of GIRK2 in the hippocampus of P301S mice, but not in APP/PS1 mice, and a loss of pre-and postsynaptic GIRK2 channels from the plasma membrane and accumulation at intracellular sites in CA1 pyramidal cells in the two transgenic mice.

Results

Brain Expression of GIRK2 Channels in P301S Mice
We first determined the GIRK2 expression in the brain of P301S mice and age-matched wild type mice at 3 and 10 months using a GIRK2 subunit-specific antibody in conventional histoblotting
In wild type mice, GIRK2 immunolabelling was widely distributed in the brain at the two ages studied, with strong labelling in the hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellum, septum, and thalamus (Figure
Moderate labelling was observed in midbrain nuclei, including the inferior and superior colliculus, and brainstem nuclei (Figure
Faint labelling was observed in basal ganglia nuclei such as the caudate putamen (Figure
Qualitatively, this brain expression pattern was similar in the brain of P301S mice (Figure
Quantitatively, analyses carried out to compare the protein expression levels revealed that this expression pattern of the wild type was unchanged in the brain of P301S mice at 3 months (Figure
GIRK2 exhibited broad distributions in the brain and region-specific differences were determined by densitometric analysis of the scanned histoblots (panels C,F).
Strong GIRK2 staining was observed in the hippocampus (Hp), neocortex (Ctx), cerebellum (Cb), septum (Sp), and thalamus (Th), with moderate staining in midbrain nuclei and faint in the caudate putamen (CPu).
Densitometric analysis showed no differences in GIRK2 expression in the brain of P301S mice at 3 months but showed a significant decrease in the hippocampus at 10 months of age (Multiple ttests and Holm-Sidack method, * p < 0.05).

We next focused on the hippocampus, the brain region showing the significant reduction of GIRK2 expression and explored its laminar expression pattern using the histoblot technique (Figure
In wild-type mice, GIRK2 was expressed in all hippocampal subfields and dendritic layers at the two ages (Figure
The expression was strongest in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare in the CA1 region, with the stratum radiatum showing a moderate intensity in the proximal half and a strong intensity in the distal half, and with the stratum oriens also showing moderate intensity (Figure
In the CA3 region, expression for GIRK2 was strongest in the strata lucidum, radiatum and lacunosummoleculare, compared with the more moderate expression in the stratum oriens (Figure
In the dentate gyrus, expression was strong in the molecular layer but weak in the hilus (Figure
This expression pattern was very similar in all subfields and dendritic layers analysed between wild-type and P301S mice of 3 months (Figure
However, the hippocampal expression of GIRK2 showed decrease in labelling at 10 months of age in a laminar-specific manner (Figure
Quantitative analyses demonstrated that the expression of GIRK2 was reduced in the strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 and the CA3 regions, and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of P301S mice compared to age-matched wild type mice (Figure

Altered Postsynaptic Localisation of GIRK2 in the Hippocampus of Transgenic Mice

The analysis was carried out in the stratum radiatum, a subfield exhibiting prominent labelling for GIRK2.
Immunoreactivity for the GIRK2 subunit in wild type mice was primarily detected in postsynaptic elements, namely, on dendritic spines and shafts of CA1 pyramidal cells (Figures
Immunoparticles were localised at the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of dendritic spines in contact with axon terminals, likely deriving from Schaffer collaterals, and dendritic shafts, as well as at intracellular sites associated with the endoplasmic reticulum cisterna (Figures

Altered Presynaptic Localisation of GIRK2 in the Hippocampus of Transgenic Mice

This significant reduction in the density of GIRK2 is consistent with the reduction in expression described with histoblot.
In APP/PS1 mice, the density of GIRK2 was not significantly different (1.82 immunoparticles/μm 2 in wild type and 1.77 immunoparticles/μm 2 in APP/PS1), consistent with the unaltered expression of GIRK2 protein observed using histoblot.

Discussion
GIRK channel activation in the hippocampus provides a major inhibitory pathway that is important in physiological and pathological states.
Given that GIRK channels play a crucial role in cognitive function
In the present work, our goal was to investigate if the expression and subcellular localisation of the GIRK2 subunit undergoes changes in two transgenic models of AD.
We have quantified the expression of GIRK2 channels within the hippocampus of two transgenic mice and determined their reduction in expression in P301S mice at 10 months but not in APP/PS1 mice at 12 months.
At the ultrastructural level, our data provide the first detailed description of the altered localisation of GIRK2 channels in the hippocampus in the two transgenic mouse models, presenting quantitative evidence that a reduction in GIRK2 takes place both in postsynaptic and presynaptic compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells.
The reported decrease of GIRK2 channels along the plasma membrane in both P301S and APP/PS1 mice may be one of the contributing factors to the synaptic dysfunctions and memory deficits in the two AD models.

Differential Expression Pattern of GIRK Channels in Transgenic Mice
Previous in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical reports have shown that the GIRK2 subunit is the most abundant subunit of GIRK channels in the hippocampus
Accordingly, we have shown by histoblot that GIRK2 was widely expressed in the hippocampus at ages of 3, 10 and 12 months and the labelling was particularly strong in dendritic layers, consistent with previous studies carried out in young adult mice
Changes in protein expression have been reported to take place in AD pathology, but information on the signalling proteins and neuronal pathways affected is scarce.
Given the limitations of investigating AD in human subjects, to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disorder current studies mostly rely on animal models resembling all stages of disease progression.
Pathological studies suggest that neuronal dysfunction caused by Aβ oligomers ultimately results in NFT formation and neuron death
Furthermore, increasing evidence is linking Tau and Aβ in synaptic dysfunction
Here, to determine the potential pathophysiological relevance of Tau and Aβ in neuronal GIRK channels, we first investigated whether Tau pathology and Aβ pathology could result in a change in the expression of GIRK2.
One important finding is that the GIRK2 protein expression is reduced in the hippocampus of P301S mice.
This alteration is taking place in a laminar-dependent manner, mainly affecting dendritic compartments related with the perforant pathway.
Given that the AD pathologic increase of phospho-Tau and Aβ in the entorhinal cortex, which induce synaptic weakening in the hippocampus
Additionally, we also detected a strikingly similar reduction in the expression of the GIRK1 subunit in the hippocampus of P301S mice.
This data, together with the dramatic reduction of GIRK1 labelling observed in the hippocampus of GIRK2 KO mice
The relevance of GIRK3 to hippocampal GIRK channels in AD remains an interesting subject that deserves further investigations.
In the present study, a decrease in GIRK2 protein expression was not detected in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, consistent with the unaltered mRNA and protein expression of GIRK1 Aβ (1-42)-infused rat model of AD
However, previous studies using different models showed that Aβ induces a reduction in gene expression of hippocampal GIRK channel subunits and decreases GIRK conductance in pyramidal cells
Whilst are data contrasts with other studies, this may be due to the fact that we used different models of AD, which recapitulate distinct features of the disorder.
Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that these changes in expression are the result of the significant neuronal loss associated with P301S mice

Altered Postsynaptic Localisation of GIRK Channels in Transgenic Mice
Neuronal GIRK channels mediate the postsynaptic inhibitory effects of many neurotransmitters and drugs of abuse that target G i/o -coupled receptors
Here, we provide direct evidence that GIRK2 is found predominantly at postsynaptic sites in dendritic compartments of CA1 pyramidal cell in the hippocampus, which is consistent with previous studies in the hippocampus, neocortex, substantia nigra and cerebellum
Our ultrastructural data support the main postsynaptic role of GIRK channels as described in previous electrophysiological studies
Perhaps the most striking finding of the quantitative immunoelectron microscopic analyses undertaken in this study is the reduction in the frequency of immunoparticles for GIRK2 on the plasma membrane of CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of both P301S and APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by an increase of immunoparticles at intracellular sites.
In comparing the subcellular localisation of GIRK2 in the two animal models of AD, we show that the GIRK channel subunit labels intracellular sites more frequently than the plasma membrane.
Interestingly, recent studies reported strikingly similar subcellular changes for GABA B receptors in the same compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells in APP/PS1 mice
One of the best characterised effectors modulated by GABA B receptors is the GIRK channel, whose activation is responsible for the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials IPSP in hippocampal pyramidal cells
This functional association is facilitated by the formation of stable macromolecular complexes
Altogether, our data suggest that Aβ pathology induce an impartment in the excitability of pyramidal cells mediated by GABA B -GIRK signalling.
Based on the similar GIRK2 reductions at ultrastructural level, it is expected that Tau pathology induce similar alterations.
Whilst the two transgenic mouse models we used for this study, revealed at the qualitative level, a reduction of GIRK2 along the plasma membrane and accumulation at intracellular sites, it is important to note that immunoparticles for GIRK2 in the hippocampus of P301S were found at lower frequencies than in APP/PS1 mice.
Such difference could be explained by the neuronal loss observed in the former mouse model
In APP/PS1 mice we did not detect any change in the total protein expression, consistent with the similar density of immunoparticles detected using immunoelectron microscopic techniques.
However, Aβ pathology induced a change in the subcellular localisation of GIRK2 from plasma membrane to intracellular sites.
Similar subcellular changes have been described for different receptors in the same compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells in APP/PS1 mice

Altered Presynaptic Distribution of GIRK Channels in Transgenic Mice
In addition to its main postsynaptic distribution, a small but consistent presynaptic labelling for GIRK2 was also detected in glutamatergic axon terminals establishing synapses with CA1 neurons, consistent with previous observations in many brain regions
Presynaptic inhibition in the hippocampus results primarily from the G-protein-dependent regulation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel activity
Although electrophysiological studies did not support a role for presynaptic GIRK channels
Although most studies dealing with the implication of Aβ and tau in synaptic dysfunction have concentrated in postsynaptic receptors and dendritic mechanisms
A notable finding of our quantitative ultrastructural studies is the decrease of presynaptic GIRK2 in axon terminals from Schaffer collaterals in both P301S and APP/PS1 mice.
Consistent with our results, evidence from immunoelectron microscopic studies in the APP/PS1 mouse model suggests that GABA B receptors located at presynaptic sites are also reduced in the Schaffer collateral synapses
Previous reports indicated that the increase in Aβ production is linked to reduced GABA B receptor expression in the APP-/-mice
Given that GABA B receptors are molecularly and functionally coupled with GIRK channels, mainly the GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits, in the hippocampus
In summary, the work presented here supports the evidence that phospho-Tau and Aβ can modulate the expression and localisation of hippocampal GIRK2-containing channels in the AD pathogenesis.
Our quantitative analyses demonstrate for the first time how the subcellular localisation of GIRK2 channels is altered both pre-and postsynaptically in P301S and APP/PS1 mice.
The pre-and postsynaptic reduction of GIRK channel in pyramidal cells may represent the molecular and anatomical substrate of the altered cognitive function observed in the two mouse models of AD.
These findings highlight the functional importance of this change in subcellular localisation because it implies a specific lack of functions for GIRK2 in the modulation of neuronal excitability in pathological conditions.

Material and Methods

Animals
We used transgenic mice P301S for the human tau gene and wild type control littermates.
The P301S mouse model, obtained from Jackson laboratory (B6;C3-Tg(Prnp-MAPT*P301S)PS19Vle/J), carries a mutant (P301S) human MAPT gene encoding T34-tau isoform (1N4R) driven by the mouse prion-protein promoter (Prnp) on a B6C3H/F1 genetic background.
For analysis, we selected animals of 3 months of age, characterised by no sign of pathology
A total of 12 mice aged 3 months (n = 3 for WT, n = 3 for P301S for histoblotting; and n = 3 for WT, n = 3 for P301S for immunoelectron microscopy) and 12 mice aged 10 months (n = 3 for WT, n = 3 for P301S for histoblotting; and n = 3 for WT, n = 3 for P301S for immunoelectron microscopy) were analysed.
All mice were housed at the "Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa" animal facility.
Mice were housed four per cage with food and water available ad libitum and maintained in a temperature-controlled environment on a 12/12 h light-dark cycle with light onset at 07:00 h.
Animal housing and maintenance protocols followed the guidelines of Council of Europe Convention ETS123, recently revised as indicated in Directive 86/609/EEC.
Animal experiments were performed under protocols (P15/P16/P18/P22) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Utilisation Committee (Comité de Ética de Experimentación Animal del CBM, CEEA-CBM, Madrid, Spain).
In addition, male APP/PS1 mice (RRID:IMSR_MMRRC:034832) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (
we construct in conjunction with the exon-9-deleted variant of human presenilin 1 [Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax]
The "control" wild type (WT) mice were age-matched littermates without the transgene.
For analysis, we selected animals of 12 months of age, characterised by memory deficits with severe synapse loss and widespread Aβ deposition
A total of 12 mice (n = 3 for WT, n = 3 for APP/PS1 for histoblotting; and n = 3 for WT, n = 3 for APP/PS1 for immunoelectron microscopy) were analysed.
All mice were maintained at the Animal House Facility of the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Albacete, Spain) in cages of 2 or more mice, on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 24 • C and received food and water ad libitum.
Care and handling of animals prior to and during experimental procedures were in accordance with Spanish (RD 1201/2015) and European Union regulations (86/609/EC), and all protocols and methodologies were approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee.
For histoblotting, animals were deeply anesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine 1:1 (ketamine, 100 mg/kg; xylazine, 10 mg/kg), the hippocampus was dissected, frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 • C. For immunohistochemistry experiments at the electron microscopic level, using the pre-embedding immunogold technique, animals were firstly deeply anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine 1:1 (ketamine, 100 mg/kg; xylazine, 10 mg/kg) and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold fixative containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde with 0.05% (v/v) glurataldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) for 15 min.
After perfusion, brains were removed from the skull and tissue blocks were washed thoroughly in 0.1 M PB.
Coronal 60 µm thick sections were cut on a Vibratome (Leica V1000, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).

Antibodies and Chemicals
We used a guinea pig anti-GIRK2 polyclonal antibody (GP-Af830; aa.
390-421 of mouse GIRK2A-1; RRID: AB_2571713; Frontier Institute Co., Hokkaido, Japan) and a rabbit anti-GIRK1 polyclonal antibody (Rb-Af530; aa.
469-501 of mouse GIRK1 C-terminal; RRID: AB_2571711; Frontier Institute Co., Japan).
The preparation, purification, full characterisation, and specificity of these antibodies have been described previously
The secondary antibodies used were as follows: alkaline phosphatase (AP)-goat anti-guinea pig IgG (H+L) (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich, Sant Louis, MO, USA), and goat anti-guinea pig IgG coupled to 1.4 nm gold (1:100; Nanoprobes Inc., Stony Brook, NY, USA).

Histoblotting
The regional distribution of GIRK2 was analysed in P301S and APP/PS1 mouse brains using the histoblot technique
Briefly, horizontal cryostat sections (10 µm) from mouse brains (wild type and transgenics) were apposed to nitrocellulose membranes moistened with 48 mM Tris-base, 39 mM glycine, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate and 20% (v/v) methanol for 15 min at room temperature (~20 • C).
After blocking in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, nitrocellulose membranes were treated with DNase I (5 U/mL), washed and incubated in 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) for 60 min at 45 • C to remove adhering tissue residues.
After extensive washing, the blots were reacted with affinity purified anti-GIRK2 antibodies (0.5 mg/mL) in blocking solution overnight at 4 • C. The bound primary antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibodies
To compare the expression levels of GIRK2 between (1) the wild type and P301S mice, and (2) wild type and APP/PS1 mice, at the experimental ages, all nitrocellulose membranes were processed in parallel, and the same incubation time for each reagent was used for the antibody.
Digital images were acquired by scanning the nitrocellulose membranes using a desktop scanner (HP Scanjet 8300).
Image analysis and processing were performed using the Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) as described previously
A series of primary and secondary antibody dilutions and incubation times were used to optimise the experimental conditions for the linear sensitivity range of all reactions and to confirm that all labelling was below saturation levels.

Immunohistochemistry for Electron Microscopy
Immunohistochemical reactions at the electron microscopic level were carried out using the pre-embedding immunogold as described earlier
Briefly, free-floating sections obtained from wild type and P301S mice at 10 months, and from wild type and APP/PS1 mice at 12 months, were incubated in parallel in 10% (v/v) NGS diluted in TBS.
Sections were then incubated in anti-GIRK2 antibodies (3-5 µg/mL diluted in TBS containing 1% (v/v) NGS), followed by incubation in goat anti-guinea pig IgG coupled to 1.4 nm gold (Nanoprobes Inc., Stony Brook, NY, USA).
Sections were postfixed in 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and washed in double-distilled water, followed by silver enhancement of the gold particles with an HQ Silver kit (Nanoprobes Inc.).
Sections were then treated with osmium tetraoxide (1% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer), block-stained with uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded series of ethanol and flat-embedded on glass slides in Durcupan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) resin.
Regions of interest were cut at 70-90 nm on an ultramicrotome (Reichert Ultracut E, Leica, Vienna, Austria) and collected on single slot pioloform-coated copper grids.
Staining was performed on drops of 1% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds's lead citrate.
Ultrastructural analyses were performed in a JEOL-1400Flash electron microscope (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).

Quantification and Analysis of Pre-Embedding Immunogold Labelling
To establish the relative abundance of GIRK2 immunoreactivity in different compartments of CA1 pyramidal cells between wild type and P301S mice at 10 months, and from wild type and APP/PS1 mice at 12 months, we used 60-µm-thick coronal slices processed for pre-embedding immunogold immunohistochemistry.
The procedure was similar to that as described previously
Briefly, for each of three animals per experimental group, three samples of tissue were obtained for the preparation of embedding blocks.
To minimise false negatives, electron microscopic serial ultrathin sections were cut close to the surface of each block, as immunoreactivity decreased with depth.
We estimated the quality of GIRK2 immunolabelling by always selecting areas with optimal gold labelling at approximately the same distance from the cutting surface.
Randomly selected areas were then photographed from the selected ultrathin sections and used with final magnification between 30,000 and 50,000 X.
Quantification of immunogold labelling for GIRK2 was carried out in reference areas of the CA1 region totalling approximately 2000 µm 2 .
We counted immunoparticles identified in each reference area and present in different subcellular compartments: dendritic spines, dendritic shafts, and axon terminals.
The data were expressed as a percentage of immunoparticles for GIRK2 in each subcellular compartment, both in the plasma membrane and at intracellular sites.

Controls
To test method specificity in the procedures for histoblot and electron microscopy, the primary antibody was either omitted or replaced with 5% (v/v) normal serum of the species of the primary antibody, resulting in total loss of the signal.
For the preembedding technique, labelling patterns were also compared with those obtained with Calbindin (polyclonal rabbit anti-Calbindin D-9k CB9; Swant, Marly, Switzerland); only the antibodies against GIRK2 consistently labelled the plasma membrane.

Data Analysis
To avoid observer bias, we performed blinded experiments for histoblots and immunohistochemistry prior to data analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA, USA) and data were presented as mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise.
Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
The statistical evaluation of the histoblots was performed using the Multiple t-test, with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons.
To compute SEM error bars, three blots were measured from each animal.
