Unraveling Binding Mechanism of Alzheimer's Drug Rivastigmine Tartrate with Human Transferrin: Molecular Docking and Multi-Spectroscopic Approach towards Neurodegenerative Diseases
Studying drug-protein interactions has gained significant attention lately, and this is because the majority of drugs interact with proteins, thereby altering their structure and, moreover, their functionality.
Rivastigmine tartrate (RT) is a drug that is in use for mild to moderate Alzheimer therapy.
This study was targeted to characterize the interaction between human transferrin (hTf) and RT by employing spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular docking studies.
Experimental results of fluorescence quenching of hTf induced by RT implied the formation of a static complex between hTf and RT.
Further elucidation of the observed fluorescence data retorting Stern-Volmer and modified Stern-Volmer resulted in binding constants for hTf-RT complex of the order 10 4 M -1 over the studied temperatures.
Thermodynamic parameters of hTf-RT interaction were elucidated further by employing these obtained binding constant values.
It was quite evident from obtained thermodynamic attributes that RT spontaneously binds to hTf with a postulated existence of hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces.
Further, Circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) also confirmed RT-hTf complex formation owing to upward movement of CD spectra in the presence of RT.
ITC profiles advocated the existence of reaction to be spontaneous.
Moreover, molecular docking further revealed that the important residues play a pivotal role in RT-hTf interaction.
The findings of this study can be of a significant benefit to the drug-designing industry in this disease-prone era.

Introduction
The physiological functions of our body are governed by various factors where many essential elements play a vital role.
Thus, maintaining proper levels of these elements is very important and the homeostasis is controlled through highly regulated mechanisms of uptake, storage, and secretion
This disrupted homeostasis is implicated in many disorders ranging from Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's (HD) diseases to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
One of the important elements in this perspective is iron, which is amongst a vital trace element engaged in diversified physiological functions.
The so-called "biometals" (iron, copper, or zinc) play a vital role in key metabolic processes and, hence, are considered life essential
Free iron is a potent neurotoxin, and this toxicity can be owed to its redox activities.
If homeostasis is disrupted, it might lead to cellular death or dysfunctionality
Loss of iron may cause neurological disease, whereas deposition of free iron or its abnormal interaction with cellular components directly or indirectly contributes to neurodegenerative disorders
Thus, it is quite evident that iron homeostasis disruption can be lethal in many ways.
Therefore, maintaining iron homeostasis is a significant task, with human transferrin (hTf) and ferritin at the center.
The intracellular pool of free iron, the labile iron pool (LIP), was well recognized and amends the expression of various proteins viz.
amyloid precursor protein (APP) and many others
There are various literatures that report the deposition of transition metals in nervous system in different neurodegenerative disorders, thereby advocating the role played by these metals
Excessive iron deposition in the central nervous system (CNS) has been linked to neurodegenerative pathologies, namely AD, PD, ALS, and neuro-ferritinopathies and many more.
Transferrin family is a group of proteins that function in the transport of iron around the blood stream after forming an iron-protein complex
hTf is a glycoprotein which has a molecular weight of 79.6 kDa.
The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are β amyloids, which are insoluble deposits of 4 kDa peptides of ~40-42 amino acids and are key players in Alzheimer's disease
The importance of this disorder can take note from the fact that, globally, it affects nearly 40 million people coupled with a well-being budget of about $820 billion per year
With developments in the pharmaceutical industry, thorough investigation of the interactions of important classes of therapeutics as well as of other potential drugs with either plasma or target tissue, proteins have been considered an important part of pharmacological profiling
Studying drug-protein interactions have become imperative in this era where each new day a new disease is encountered and there are many existing lethal disorders against which drugs are being continuously tried and targeted.
Rivastigmine tartrate (RT) is a carbamate inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase which is used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in adults
Rivastigmine exhibits log linear pharmacokinetics at dosages up to 6 mg daily.
The incidence rates of adverse events from clinical trials of rivastigmine appear less flattering than those of other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
Outside the clinical trial setting, some clinicians may have found it difficult to escalate initial doses of rivastigmine to effective doses (6 to 12 mg) because of adverse effects.
RT has been shown to improve patient's performance in all the three major domains: cognitive function, global function, and behavior
This study was intended to understand the interaction between RT and hTf and the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction.
This study employed fluorescence spectroscopy observations coupled with molecular docking studies for better insight into the RT-hTf interaction.

Materials and Methods

Materials
Human transferrin and Rivastigmine tartrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St.
Louis, MO, USA).
Unless stated, all the chemicals were procured from Sigma.
Double distilled and de-ionized water from a Milli-Q ® UF-Plus purification system (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was used for preparation of all buffers.

Stock Solution of hTf and RT
Our experimentation involved preparation of a starting solution of 62-µM hTf.
This was done in a 50-mM sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.4.
Correspondingly, a stock solution of 4-mM RT was made up in double distilled water.

Steady State Fluorescence
Fluorescence spectroscopy was retorted for understanding the RT-hTf interaction.
Our experimental parameters were as follows: quartz cuvette was used with a path length of 1 cm while the recording range was 300-400 nm with excitation performed at 280 nm.
hTf (4 µM) was titrated with RT in a ratio of 1:8.
This assay was carried out at three varying temperatures (301, 303, and 305 K).
Further, Stern Volmer equation (Equation (
where the highest fluorescence intensity of free hTf is depicted by F 0 , fluorescence intensity of the RT-hTf complex is shown by F, the Stern-Volmer constant is depicted by K sv , and [C] depicts the concentration of quencher (RT).

where K depicts the binding constant, ∆H 0 refers to the enthalpy change while ∆G 0 corresponds to the free Gibbs energy change, ∆S 0 depicts the change in entropy, and R is the universal gas constant (1.987 cal mol -1 K -1 ).

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy (CD)
CD spectra of free protein and drug protein were procured, making use of JASCO-J-1500 spectropolarimeter (JASCO INTERNATIONAL CO., LTD.11-10, Myojin-cho 1-chome, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0046, Japan) connected with a Peltier-type temperature (PTC-517) controller along with USB 2.0/Spectra Manager™ or Spectra Manager™ CFR.
The calibration of the instrument was done with d-10-camphorsulfonic acid.
Our experimental parameters were as follows: recording range was 205-250 nm, constant temperature of 25 • C, scan rate of 100 nm/min with response time of 1 s, and 0.1 cm path length cuvette

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
ITC is an efficient technique for studying thermodynamic profiling of protein-drug interactions.
To begin ITC, protein and ligands were thoroughly degassed for 30 minutes prior to loading of the samples in cells and syringes in a bid to remove any bubbles present in protein and ligand solutions.
VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (Micro Cal Inc., Northampton, MA, USA) coupled with Origin 8.0 software (Northampton, MA, USA, Origin Lab Corporation One Roundhouse Plaza Northampton, MA 01060 USA) was used to carry out ITC measurements at 25 • C. The reference cell was filled with double distilled water whilst the sample cell was filled with 20-µM hTf; 25 injections of degassed 1-mM RT solution were infused by rotating the syringe in the sample cell filled with the protein of interest.
Each injection spanned 10 s, with 180 s being the spacing in two successive injections; the initial delay for the first one was 60 s, 307 rpm was the rotation speed of the syringe, and the reference power was 16 µcal s -1 .

Molecular Docking Analysis
This study was accomplished on DELL ® Workstation with Intel ® Xeon ® CPU E5-2609 v3 processor (Intel Corporation, Delhi, India), 64 GB RAM, and two TB hard disk (DELL Precision Tower 7810, DELL, New Delhi, INDIA) running on an Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS operating system (Trusty Tahr, Canonical Ltd., London, UK).
Online resources Protein Data Bank (PDB)
Bioinformatics tools AutoDock Vina
Atomic coordinates of the hTf crystal structure were taken from PDB (ID: 3V83), and it was subsequently preprocessed in SPDBV
Subsequently, co-crystalized ligands were removed from the native PDB coordinates file.
RT was obtained from the PubChem database in the processed three-dimensional format.
The docking was structurally blind for the compound where it was free to move and search the binding site(s) of the protein.
Here, based on the binding affinity and scoring, the top binding pose among nine possible docked conformations of RT with hTf was selected.

Results and Discussion

Steady State Fluorescence Studies
When a complex is formed between proteins and ligands, intrinsic fluorescence can be retorted so as to be aware of this complex formation and further to find out various binding parameters for protein-ligand interaction.
A concentration-dependent quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of hTf by RT was observed upon spectral monitoring of the fluorescence intensity of the hTf-RT interaction (Figure
Fluorescence quenching refers to the event in which reduction in fluorescence intensity is observed with a corresponding increase in ligand.
The binding parameters of the RT-hTf interaction were explored by performing intrinsic fluorescence assay at varying temperatures (301, 303, and 305 K).
For native protein, there was a peak corresponding to 330 nm.
However, there was an evident decrease in hTf fluorescence with increasing RT concentration, suggesting the formation of an hTf-RT complex (Figure
After recording fluorescence quenching, the next motto was to discover the operative mode of quenching for an hTf-RT interaction.
Static quenching refers to the phenomenon in which a formed complex either acquires weak fluorescence or no fluorescence at all.
On the contrary, dynamic quenching depicts the event in which fluorescent molecules and quenchers collide.
Considerable quenching of a protein's fluorescence intensity upon binding with ligands is typically either because of static formation of a non-fluorescent complex or dynamic molecular diffusion
Temperature reliance of the quenching process can give an inner idea about the operative mode of quenching in an hTf-RT interaction.
For this very reason, varying temperatures were taken into consideration for fluorescence quenching experiments.
Therefore, in a bid to differentiate between the two distinct mechanisms, the recorded spectral results were analyzed with the help of three well-known formulae viz.
Stern-Volmer, Lineweaver-Burk, and the double-log relations
In general, a hike in temperature would lead to elevated binding constant values for the dynamic type of quenching whilst a corresponding increase in binding constant with increasing temperatures would imply a static complex formation
Equation (
The observed K sv values of hTf-RT interaction can also be indicative of the form of quenching taking place between protein and ligand.
A plot of F 0 /F vs. [C] depicted in Figure
The slope of the plot of F 0 /F vs. concentration at a fixed intercept gives the value of K sv .

A plot of F0/F vs. [C] depicted in Figure
The slope of the plot of F0/F vs. concentration at a fixed intercept gives the value of Ksv.
K sv values at three varying temperatures are shown in Table
It is quite clear that with elevation in temperature, decreased K sv values were observed and this type of variation in K sv as a function of temperature indicates the existence of the static complex formation of RT and hTf.
K q (Quenching constant) value also gives an idea about the mode of quenching occurring for protein-drug interactions.
The observed values of K q as calculated by Equation (2) are in line with the obtained K sv values (Table
Further, Equation (3), the "Modified Stern-Volmer equation", was deployed to have an understanding of hTf-RT interactions.
A plot of Log [(F 0 -F)/F] vs. log [C] in regard to the modified Stern-Volmer equation gives us the values of binding parameters for an hTf-RT interaction viz.
binding constant (K) and number of binding sites (n). Figure
The intercept gives us the binding constant (K).
The temperature dependency of the binding constant was taken into account as it gives confirmation about the effective mode of interaction for an hTf-RT interaction.
It was quite evident that the binding constant (K) decreases with increasing temperature (Figure
Number of binding sites (n) was found close to unity at all three temperatures taken into consideration (Table

One can analyze structural changes in proteins either due to interactions with ligands or some other cause by employing CD spectroscopy
It is amongst imperative tools to scrutinize alterations in proteins once the ligand binds to a protein and alters its structure
Figure
Thus, this peak at around 208 nm clearly suggests that hTf is an alpha helix-rich protein.
If the protein is alpha rich; it will show a peak at around 208 nm and 222 nm while beta sheet-rich proteins show a peak at around 218 nm

A plot of heat vs. molar ratio is being shown in the bottom panel.
ITC takes into account temperature while measuring thermodynamic parameters.
In general, it is believed that there are variations in parameters obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC.
It is a well-known fact that there are changes in thermodynamic parameters procured from ITC and fluorescence spectroscopy and that this is related to the fact that ITC measures a global change in the thermodynamic property whilst fluorescence spectroscopy takes into consideration only the local changes around the fluorophore (Trp-214)

Conclusion
Insights into the molecular features of RT-hTf binding were gained by means of fluorescence and CD spectroscopy coupled with molecular docking studies.
Fluorescence spectroscopy results implied that RT induced quenching of inherent fluorescence of hTf.
Fluorescence experimentation was accomplished at three varying temperatures (301, 303, and 305 K) in a bid to find binding constant values (K) along with the number of binding sites (n).
Mathematical calculations revealed that the observed quenching was due to static formation of the RT-hTf complex with a binding constant in the range of 10 4 M -1 , highlighting the potency of this interaction.
The Van't Hoff equation gave us the negative value of ∆G⁰, which implied the reaction was spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable.
An upward movement of CD spectra in far UV CD of protein (hTf) in the presence of drug (RT) suggested that an hTf-RT complex is formed.
The ITC profile of RT-hTf further gave confirmation of this interaction to be thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous.
Structure-based molecular docking of RT with hTf was performed to see their interaction and bound conformations, and an appreciable binding between hTf and RT was observed.
Molecular docking results clearly showed that RT occupies the internal binding pockets with appreciable binding energy and that it forms several close interactions with critically important residues.
