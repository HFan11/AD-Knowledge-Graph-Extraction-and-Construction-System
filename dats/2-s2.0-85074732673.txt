Suboptimal validity of amyloid imaging-based diagnosis and management of Alzheimer’s disease: why it is time to abandon the approach
The broken limits to life expectancy observed in the last few decades have imposed an increasing medical, social and financial burden on society
The introduction of modern imaging techniques in the 1970s and 1980s has provided powerful approaches to detect and characterize these disorders by visualizing changes at the structural and molecular levels in the brain
By now it is well understood that biochemical changes precede anatomical abnormalities in neurological diseases
Thus, diseases like AD cannot be visualized in their earlier stages by structural imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
In patients with proven AD, by the time structural abnormalities such as ventricular enlargement and cortical atrophy are detected by CT or MRI, the disease process has reached advanced stages and therefore will be already associated with significant cognitive impairment
The introduction of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) (first developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1970's in conjunction with Brookhaven National Laboratories-BNL) as a biomarker for the quantitative assessment of regional glucose metabolism in the human brain and other organs opened a new era in medical imaging that has resulted in a paradigm shift in medicine
Coincidently, the introduction of powerful Positron Emission Tomography (PET) instruments has enabled visualizing disease activity at the molecular level in many organs and in various pathological states
Over the past four decades, numerous PETbased molecular imaging probes have been developed and employed for the detection and characterization of various neuropsychiatric disorders.
Since its initial development, a central focus of research with FDG-PET has been in the assessment of cognitive decline, with emphasis on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, as an indicator of regional neuronal activity.
By the late 1970s and early 1980s, investigators at BNL, University of Pennsylvania and UCLA were among the first to assess the role of this powerful technique in detecting early evidence for AD and compare the results with those from structural imaging techniques such as CT or MRI
The imaging patterns seen on FDG-PET follow the default mode network (DMN), an anatomically defined brain network involving the medial temporal lobe and the medial prefrontal subsystems that converge for integration in the posterior cingulate gyrus
These patterns are quite characteristic of this neurodegenerative disease and the use of FDG-PET reflecting regional functional activity in the human brain has been validated for detecting early evidence of AD and differentiating it from other dementias
The diagnostic reliability (94% sensitivity and 76% specificity to detect progressive dementia; and 93% sensitivity and 73% specificity to identify AD, based on direct comparison of FDG-PET results with those of neuropathological evaluation in the same subjects), and the solid scientific foundation of the FDG-PET technology over the years
In addition to failing neuronal function, the brain of AD patients at autopsy reveals characteristic pathognomonic hallmarks involving brain accumulation of extracellular deposits of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and intracellular filamentous aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, known as neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads (Fig.
Following the first description of the presence of amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brain of a patient with AD
However, the experience gained over the years has revealed that amyloid plaques are also frequently noted in normal aging without clinical or imaging evidence for AD
In the early 1990s, the "amyloid hypothesis" was introduced with the essential claim that brain amyloid plaque deposition is causative of AD and their presence lead to neuronal degeneration and AD progression
This speculative hypothesis gained enormous publicity over the past three decades driven by the social and medical implications of the increasing AD incidence.
With increasing interest and drive from the pharmaceutical industry, substantial investments and research were initiated to develop specific amyloid diagnostic tests
However, the existing Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria for a neuropathological diagnosis of AD (National Institutes of Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)) is not confined to the exclusive presence of amyloid Aβ pathology in the brain, but stresses the importance of both brain tau and Aβ aggregate deposition.
These criteria include (A) β-amyloidosis in the medial temporal lobe; (B) Braak tau pathology stages (I-VI stages); (C) scoring of neuritic plaques in at least five neocortical regions
Therefore, the ABC diagnostic criteria established for brain pathology specimens represent a significant challenge to the logic behind the utilization of PET "Aβ-specific" imaging probes as AD diagnostic tools, which the literature points to as their intended use
The current PET "Aβ-specific" imaging probes cannot meet by definition CERAD criteria B (tau pathology) and, as designed, they do not meet criteria A (detection of β-amyloidosis in the medial temporal lobe)
Unfortunately, in spite of these established considerations, many investigators around the world adopted the use of PET "Aβ-specific" imaging probes, and a large number of publications began to appear in the literature in the 2000s and have continued into recent years.
Carbon 11 (t 1/2 = 20 min) was the initial positron emitting radioisotope used to label amyloid agents, but its short half-life posed a problem for commercialization.
Therefore, by the mid-2000s, efforts were made to develop other "amyloid specific" PET probes using Fluorine-18 (t 1/2 = 109 min) to facilitate transport to relatively distant locations for imaging
These developments with PET "Aβ-specific" imaging probes (either from the 6hydroxybenzothiazole (e.g., 11 C PIB, fluoroPIB or flutemetamol) or trans stilbene (e.g., florbetapir and florbetaben) structural families) bypassed the significance of brain tau-pathology in the disease and projected the beginning of a new era in PET imaging for AD
Confirmatory multi-center trials were initiated by performing PET "Aβ-specific" imaging in terminally ill patients followed by post-mortem examination of their brains to allow comparison of histological results with those of in vivo imaging data
However, these studies were not designed to compare quantitatively regional cortical amyloid imaging data with those of the underlying Aβ pathology throughout the whole brain (with very limited exceptions)
Because of its biased design, which may have also allowed global imaging correlation results with multiple brain targets in terminal stages of the disease, including inflammatory markers, these highly publicized studies were challenged in their validity by investigators and the US Public Citizens, an organization established to protect the public from misleading for-profit organizations.
Subsequently, multicenter trials were conducted to validate the efficacy of 18 F-labeled amyloid agents in both controls and AD patients with claims that such imaging methods were highly sensitive and specific for AD.
Soon thereafter, applications were made to the FDA for their approval for routine diagnosis and management of patients with AD, but these applications only resulted in the FDA approval for the use of a PET "Aβ-specific" probe for ruling out AD and not for diagnosing AD.
CMS subsequently declined reimbursement based on "insufficient evidence to conclude that the use of positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-beta (Aβ) imaging is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment…….and
thus PET Aβ imaging is not covered under §1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act ("the Act")."
Over the past several years, we have emphasized the difficulties that are faced in characterizing the underlying causes of AD with PET
This partly relates to the structural location of uptake of the agents that target these plaques and partly to their non-specific concentration in the adjacent tissues including the white matter.
As such, a recent publication comparing results of FDG-PET imaging to those of amyloid scan data, further confirmed the superior performance of FDG-PET and the limitations of "amyloid imaging" in the evaluation of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD
As a result of this failed attempt for regulatory approval, proponents of the PET amyloid-beta (Aβ) imaging approach urged the CMS to initiate an open-label, longitudinal cohort study called the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) Study on a large sample (16,000+) of subjects with the intent "to assess patient outcomes."
This study is currently in the final stages of completion, but no directives have been established on how PET amyloid-beta (Aβ) imaging-e.g., as a means to predict the possible development of AD-would be used in light of the existing scientific and CERAD data indicating the ABC diagnostic requirements for AD
Also, no consideration has been given to the emerging evidence that these amyloid-beta (Aβ) imaging probes may target other brain tissues that are not necessarily associated with AD or other dementias (Fig.
In spite of limitations of Aβ PET imaging to diagnose AD, it still seemed reasonable to pursue the "amyloid hypothesis" by initiating anti-amyloid-based therapeutic interventions
The logic of the amyloid hypothesis was based on the assumed role of amyloid-β plaques in triggering neurodegenerative processes that eventually lead to the cognitive symptoms in patients with AD.
In this context, amyloid-β plaques are the therapeutic target and therefore it is hypothesized that eliminating these structures would result in cessation of disease progression and possibly cognitive improvement.
The "amyloid hypothesis" has been a central basis of research in this field for more than 25 years and has underpinned much of the research on the diagnosis and treatment of AD
Its proponents promised in as early as 2005 that "an effective anti-amyloid strategy will become available for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease within the next few years"
However, the amyloid hypothesis was never uniformly embraced and has been criticized seriously for many years
Critics have argued that amyloid (and neurofibrillary) pathologies are compensatory phenomena, and thus are manifestations of cellular adaptation to inflammation and oxidative stress initiating factor of the disease process
The consistent and systematic failures of a large number of anti-amyloid therapies in the last two decades have raised even more questions about the validity of the amyloid hypothesis.
However, the pioneers who introduced this hypothesis and the others who have strongly defended its validity are not yet convinced that the hypothesis may be poorly conceived
They argue that the treatments were started too late to reverse or stop the disease process in recent trials
As a result, much hope was placed on trials that enrolled subjects at risk of AD who have not yet experienced clear-cut symptoms of the disease, including those with an inherited form of the condition
But a recent failure in one of the AD prevention therapy studies which involved administering a beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), also known as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 inhibitor, led to discontinuation of the trial.
Patients enrolled in the study showed severe side effects and worsening clinical conditions, which raised serious ethical concerns about the safety of anti-amyloid therapeutic approach
Therefore, not only these treatments have shown to be ineffective in improving cognitive function, they have caused some deterioration of the baseline mental abilities.
Some of these trials have also shown to be associated with significant MRI-based brain abnormalities (i.e., amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or ARIA), which may explain the findings on neuropsychiatric evaluations of the patients enrolled in these projects.
Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches rooted in the "amyloid hypothesis" have permeated every fiber of AD research for decades by creating a domain of deceiving intellectual monopoly.
These unjustified efforts have affected the decisions of funding agencies and editorial offices, and as such, have prevented the exploration of new ideas and avenues of research
In such circumstances, there is nothing more convincing than the evidence that have been collected after more than 30 years and billions of dollars spent by the funding agencies and pharmaceutical industry about the futility of these unjustified efforts.
At this juncture, there is no clear-cut data to support the use of these approaches for either diagnosis or management of AD.
Moreover, the severe adverse effects, including detectable brain damage by MRI, as well as acceleration in cognitive decline observed in subjects participating in anti-amyloid therapeutic trials have raised not only medical but also ethical concerns.
The proposed use of "amyloid imaging" as a predictor of patient outcomes, when the importance of the amyloid pathology assessment alone is rejected by CERAD criteria for diagnosis of AD, is a source of substantial concern.
The psychological impact on volunteers and patients of a medical report with questionable predictive value has also been recently registered in the press
Reports of patients pondering assisted suicides based on these PET "amyloid imaging" results question the justification to continue the ongoing trials
Clearly, it is time to re-evaluate the validity of the amyloid hypothesis, anti-amyloid therapeutic interventions, and "amyloid imaging."
Support for new and fresh ideas is needed to prevent additional erosion of trust from the scientific and medical community, as well as that of the public at large in the fight for prevention, control and cure of AD.

Fig.
The middle row images were generated by reversing the patterns in the top row images to demonstrate expected results from PET-based amyloid tracers.
In other words, these images are intended to show intense uptake at the lobes where there is significantly reduced glucose metabolism as seen on FDG-PET images.
However, the bottom row contains observed PET-based amyloid images where the pattern of uptake is significantly different from the expected results with substantial frontal lobe uptake which appears normal on FDG-PET scan.
Therefore, it is quite clear that the PET tracers proposed to visualize amyloid plaques are non-specific in nature and cannot be relied upon to determine the underlying causes of cognitive impairment either in patients with MCI or dementia
