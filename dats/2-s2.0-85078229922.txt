Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase Dual-Target Inhibitors against Alzheimer’s Diseases
A series of novel compounds 6a-h, 8i-1, 10s-v, and 16a-d were synthesized and evaluated, together with the known analogs 11a-f, for their inhibitory activities towards acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).
The inhibitory activities of AChE and BChE were evaluated in vitro by Ellman method.
The results show that some compounds have good inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE.
Among them, compound 8i showed the strongest inhibitory effect on both AChE (eeAChE IC 50 = 0.39 µM) and BChE (eqBChE IC 50 = 0.28 µM).
Enzyme inhibition kinetics and molecular modeling studies have shown that compound 8i bind simultaneously to the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and the catalytic sites (CAS) of AChE and BChE.
In addition, the cytotoxicity of compound 8i is lower than that of Tacrine, indicating its potential safety as anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD) agents.
In summary, these data suggest that compound 8i is a promising multipotent agent for the treatment of AD.

Introduction
According to the report of the International Alzheimer's Association in the last three years, there are more than 36 million AD patients in the world.
With the acceleration of the aging process of the population, the amount of AD incidence is increasing year by year, and the number of AD patients in the world will exceed 130 million by 2050
The incidence of AD is over 1.9% among people over 60 years old in China
AD is the third most common disease in the elderly after cardio-cerebrovascular disease and cancer.
AD can cause dementia, which is one of the six leading causes of death in the United States
AD was initially characterized by memory loss, cognitive dysfunction, inability to take care of themselves in daily life, and subsequent exacerbations of mental and behavioral abnormalities
AD is not only a seriously threaten of human health and life, but also brings heavy mental burden and economic pressure to the family members and friends of the patients, causing huge fluctuations in the social economy.
Therefore, it is an important task of medicinal chemists to develop effective drugs for the treatment of AD
AD is a complex neurodegenerative syndrome.
Due to the complicated pathogenesis of AD, its etiology is not completely clear.
The therapeutic drugs used in the clinical and research stages can only delay the course of AD, but there are no drugs that cure or delay the course of AD
A large number of studies have shown that hypotheses of the pathogenesis of AD include the theory of cholinergic damage, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) cascade hypothesis, metal ion homeostasis theory, APOE genotype, oxidative stress theory and so on
Previous studies have identified three pathological features of AD: decreased levels of AChE in the neurotransmitter matrix, deposition of Aβ, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein.
Scientists have been trying to find the etiology and treatment strategy of AD through further study of the above three pathological characteristics
At present, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are the main treatment for AD.
Only five drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat AD.
Four of them are AChEIs, including Tacrine, Donepezil, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine.
Tacrine is the first generation AChEI, but it is limited in clinical usage because of hepatotoxicity
There are two types of ChEs in the central nervous system, namely AChE and BChE.
AChE and BChE are important targets for the development of anti-AD drugs.
The physiological function of AChE has been preliminarily understood, but the understanding of BChE is less.
Studies have shown that ACh activity in some brain regions of patients with mild to severe AD decreases to 10%-15% of the normal value, and AChEIs have significant effects on patients with mild to moderate AD and can repair their cognitive impairment and other symptoms
When AD develops to the middle and late stage, AChE activity decreases, whereas BChE activity increases, and BChE acts as a metabolic compensation for AChE, partially compensating for the role of AChE in hydrolyzing ACh
The regulation of AChE is increasingly dependent on BChE, so BChE is gradually accepted as a target of anti-AD drugs.
Therefore, the design and development of dual-target inhibitors of AChE and BChE may have the following advantages: it can not only effectively reduce the degradation of AChE and the drug resistance of AChEIs, but also be effective in patients for moderate to severe symptoms of AD.
Some people think that appropriate inhibition of AChE and BChE is a more ideal treatment for AD
Therefore, we are looking for dual-target ChEs inhibitors with inhibitory activity on both AChE and BChE.
With the study of AChE crystal structure, it was found that the ligand binding pocket of AChE in general is a long and narrow channel extending from the surface to the interior
The channel is dumbbell-shaped.
The opening and bottom of the channel are relatively open, and the middle is narrow.
The active site of AChE contains two important domains: CAS at the bottom of the channel is the binding site for substrates and inhibitors, consisting of three residues: Ser203, His447, and Glu334; PAS is situated at the opening of the channel, which is the binding site for the enzyme inhibitor.
It consists of five residues: Tyr72, Tyr124, Trp286, Tyr34 and Asp74
It was found that PAS of AChE could induce the formation of Aβ protein and accelerate its precipitation.
Researchers began to develop dual-site AChEIs that act on both CAS and PAS sites simultaneously, which can interfere with the aggregation of Aβ while enhancing the inhibitory activity of AChE, and play a dual role in the treatment of AD
In our previous studies, we found several new ChEIs through virtual screening based on pharmacophore.
We have found that G801-0274 AChE (eeAChE IC 50 = 2.05 µM), BChE (eqBChE IC 50 = 0.03 µM) can inhibit ChEs.
In this paper, we used it as the lead compound for structural modification
It has the property of dual-site binding and can bind PAS and CAS sites simultaneously.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of new derivatives based on G801-0274 and evaluated their biological activities, including cytotoxicity and AChEs inhibition.
By summarizing our data, we found a new type of dual-target inhibitor of AChE and BChE with in vitro activities, hoping to develop anti-AD drugs through further efforts (Figure

Results and Discussion

Chemistry
The synthesis of the designed compounds 6a-h and 8i-l started from 4-piperidinecarboxamide 1.
At the first step, compound 1 was reacted with appropriate substituted Benzylchloride derivatives (2a-d) under potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and potassium iodide (KI) conditions, giving relevant N-Benzylpiperidin-4-carboxamide derivatives (3a-d) with medium yields (67%-81%).
In addition, the obtained compounds 3a-d were transformed into relevant substituted  methanamine derivatives (4a-d) in the reduction reaction, which was carried out in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) using lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) under nitrogen atmosphere.
The obtained compounds 4a-d were used in further synthesis without purification.
The yields of this step were between 74% and 82%.
Finally, the commercially available nitrogen-containing heterocyclic aromatic carboxylic acids (5a-d) or 2-Oxoindoline-5-carboxylic acid 7 were activated with Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) and reacted with the appropriate amine (4a-d) in dry THF or N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) to give the target compounds 6a-h and 8i-l with moderate to good yield (35%-80%)(Scheme 1 and Scheme 2).
Compounds 10s-v were prepared (73%-88% yield) by reactions of compounds 4a-d with p-Toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl, 9) under the presence of Triethylamine (Et3N) in Dichloromethane (DCM) (Scheme 3).

These interactions increase the inhibitory activity by enhancing the binding affinity.
Then, we evaluated the effect of R on ChEs activity.
We modified R with different substituent (2-Cl, 4-OCH3, 4-CF3), compared with compound 6d, when R is 4-CF3 (6e), 4-OCH3 (11d), 2-Cl (11e), the ChEs inhibitory activity decreased.
In particular, compound 11d showed little inhibitory activity on BChE at 100 μM.
In general, with the same Y, when R is H, the compounds have the highest inhibitory activity against ChEs; when Y is substituted by 2-Cl or 4-CF3, the inhibitory activity of the compounds to ChEs were weakened; and when Y is substituted by 4-OCH3, the compounds have the worst inhibitory activity against AChEs.
We speculate that enhancing the electron-withdrawing effect or the donor effect on the aromatic ring is not conducive to improving the performance of the analog, and the appropriate space may facilitate the analog to enter the CAS pocket of ChEs.
Next, we investigated the effect of the p-Toluenesulfonamide moiety on the inhibitory activity of ChEs.
Not only the amide group was replaced by Sulfonamide moiety based on the principles of bioisosterism, but also the fused nitrogen-containing bicyclic system (Indole, Indazole, Oxoindoline, Benzimidazole) in the previous compounds was replaced by Tosyl moiety.
We synthesized compounds 10s-v.
Except for compound 10u (eeAChE 11.61% [100 μM], eqBChE 18.31% [100 μM]) has low inhibitory activity against ChEs, the compounds 10s (eeAChE IC50 = 4.24 μM, eqBChE IC50 = 4.10 μM)), 10t (eeAChE IC50 = 5.50 μM, eqBChE IC50 = 2.01 μM), 10v (eeAChE IC50 = 7.20 μM, eqBChE IC50 = 7.14 μM) all can maintain ChEs inhibitory activity at micromolar levels, indicating that the p-Toluenesulfonamide moiety is responsible for maintaining the inhibitory activity of ChEs.
On one hand, we speculate that methyl occupies the pocket of the active site and interacts with amino acid residues to increase inhibitory activity.
On the other hand, Sulfonamide moiety is very important for maintaining ChEs inhibitory activity, which may be related to the bond angle between Sulfonamide and molecules
In addition, we tested the number of carbon atoms between benzene and piperidine.
When the number of carbon atoms becomes two (compounds 16a-d), the compounds had low inhibitory activity against the two kinds of ChEs, in particular, compound 16c has no inhibitory activity against AChE at 100 μM.
We speculate that the decrease in the activity of such compounds may be that the molecular volume is too large to enter the active pocket of ChEs, indicating that the residue of N-Benzylpiperidine in the structure is an essential group for inhibiting both ChEs.
Compounds designed with a Piperazine ring instead of a piperidine ring may also have the same or higher inhibitory activity on ChEs.

It shows good activity (IC 1/4  50 4.0-30.0
µM) for AChE inhibition, and has inhibition of Aβ peptide aggregation, antioxidant activity, and metal chelation.

To determine the kinetic types of AChE and BChE inhibition, compounds 8i and 10s were selected for kinetic studies.
In each case, the kinetic types of enzyme inhibition were obtained by the modified Ellman's method and the Lineweaver-Burk secondary plots
The Lineweaver-Burk plots showed both increasing slope (decreased Vmax) and increasing intercept (higher Km) for higher inhibitor concentrations, indicating a mixed-type inhibition, including competitive inhibition and non-competitive inhibition, which possibly was because compound 8i could bind to both CAS and PAS (Figure
According to the result of molecular docking study.
The same inhibition type between compound 10s and ChEs was found in graphical analysis (Figure

AChE and BChE Inhibition Assay
The inhibitory activity of the target compound against AChE (from Electrophorus electricus (eeAChE), Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and horse serum BChE (eqBChE, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) were measured by Ellman's method
In 96-well plates, a mixture of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.0, 2 mL), 5,5 -dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB, 60 µL), acetylcholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase (20 µL, 5 IU/mL) and different concentrations of the compounds solution (30 µL) was pre-incubated for 5 min and then substrates (acetylthiocholine iodide or butyrylthiocholine iodide, 20 µL) were added.
Changes in absorbance were measured at 412 nm by using microplate reader (Thermo, Varioskan Flash 3001, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Agawam, MA, USA).
The measurement of each concentration for each compound was detected in triplicate.
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for data processing.
The inhibition curve was fitted by plotting the logarithm of the concentration of the tested compounds with the percentage of enzyme activity (reference to 100%).
The (IC 50 ) value was calculated according to the inhibition curve and the data were shown in the layout of mean ± SEM by GraphPad Prism 6.0.

Kinetics of AChE and BChE Inhibition
Kinetic studies were performed in the same manner as the determination of ChEs inhibition, with substrate (ATC/BTC) concentrations of 90, 150, 226, 452 and 904 µM.
The concentration of compound 8i was set to 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 µM, and the concentration of compound 10s was set to 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 µM.
The enzymatic reaction was extended to 7 min for eeAChE and eqBChE before the determination of the absorption.
The Vmax and Km values of Michaelis-Menten kinetics were calculated by nonlinear regression from the substrate-velocity curves using GraphPad Prism 6.0.
Linear regression was used to fit the Lineweaver-Burk plot.

Molecular Docking Study
The crystal structures of eeAChE (PDB:1C2B)
The Discovery Studio software 2016 (DS 2016, BIOVIA, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to study the docking of compound 8i.
The three protein structures are pretreated (i.e., protonated, removed water, added Miss sidechains, etc.) by the "prepare protein" module in DS to provide the structures suitable for docking.
The "prepare ligand" module in DS is used to test the structural preparation of the compound.
The native ligand in the crystal structure was used to define the binding site.
The binding site was defined as the site sphere ((in 10 Å radius) around the original ligand in the co-crystal structures.
The docking program CDOCKER encoded in DS 2016 was applied to identify the potential binding of compound 8i to eeAChE, huAChE, and huBChE.
Other CDOCKER parameters were set to default values.
Compound 8i was chosen for molecular modeling as the most active compounds in the series (Table
Compound 8i produced 10 poses to eeAChE, huAChE, and huBChE.
These postures were visually examined, and the most appropriate docking pose was selected according to the scores and interactions with key residues of the eeAChE, huAChE, and huBChE active sites.

Cell Studies in Vitro
Pheochromocytoma-derived cell line (PC12 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 • C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 .
To carry out the experiment, cells (6 × 10 3 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plate in complete medium.
After 24 h, the culture medium was removed and the cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of compounds 6b, 6c, 6d, 8i, 10s, 10v or Tacrine
Cell survival was measured by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay

Conclusions
In this paper, a series of novel compounds 6a-h, 8i-1, 10s-v, and 16a-d were synthesized and evaluated, together with the known analogs 11a-f, for their inhibitory activities towards AChE and BChE.
The results show that most of the compounds have AChE and/or BChE inhibitory activity.
Compound 8i showed the strongest inhibitory effect on both AChE (eeAChE IC 50 = 0.39 µM) and BChE (eqBChE IC 50 = 0.28 µM).
Compared with compound G801-0274, compound 8i has comparable inhibitory activity against two ChEs, so that it can exert an anti-ChEs effect in a balanced manner.
Kinetic studies indicated a mixed-type inhibition of compound 8i, including competitive inhibition and non-competitive inhibition.
Subsequently, molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interaction mechanism between compound 8i and enzymes.
Enzyme inhibition kinetics and molecular modeling studies have shown that compound 8i bind simultaneously to the PAS and the CAS of AChE and BChE.
Therefore, compounds 8i may be promising scaffold for treatment, and further modifications have been made to obtain novel AChE and BChE dual-target inhibitors.
