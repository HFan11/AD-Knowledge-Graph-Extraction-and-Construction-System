Pharmacological Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase as a New Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease
The inhibition of the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has demonstrated clinical therapeutic effects in several peripheral inflammatory-related diseases, with 3 compounds in clinical trials.
However, the role of this enzyme in the neuroinflammation process has been largely neglected.
Herein, we disclose the pharmacological validation of sEH as a novel target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Evaluation of cognitive impairment and pathological hallmarks were used in 2 models of agerelated cognitive decline and AD using 3 structurally different and potent sEH inhibitors as chemical probes.
sEH is upregulated in brains from AD patients.
Our findings supported the beneficial effects of central sEH inhibition, regarding reducing cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation pathology, and the number of amyloid plaques.
This study suggests that inhibition of inflammation in the brain by targeting sEH is a relevant therapeutic strategy for AD.

Introduction
Chronic inflammation is recognized as a key player in both the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
Indeed, 16% of the investment in ongoing clinical trials for AD is related to inflammation
Neuroinflammation is intimately linked to the oxidative stress associated with AD
However, several antioxidant therapies and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have failed in clinical trials.
Therefore, it is of vital importance to expand the scope towards novel targets, preferably related to several pathophysiological pathways of the disease
Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) mediate vasodilatation, reduce inflammation, attenuate oxidative stress, and block the pathological endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response
The soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH, EC 3.3.2.10, EPHX2), widely expressed in relatively high abundance in murine and human brains

Highlights
• sEH levels are increased in the AD human brain and in murine models.
• Inhibition of sEH reduces oxidative stress and inflammation in murine AD models.
• AD hallmarks in AD mice models are reduced after treatment with sEH inhibitors.
• sEH inhibitors improve cognition in AD mice models.
• sEH can be proposed as a new pharmacological target for AD therapy.

Considering that several lines of evidence underline a broad involvement of signaling by EETs and other EpFA in the central nervous system (CNS) function and disease
To this end, we studied the neuroprotectant role mediated by sEHI in 2 models ofL AD: the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) and 5XFAD mice models.
Because SAMP8, a paradigm of late-onset AD and cognitive impairment in age, is characterized by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and proamilodogenic APP processing, but lacks β-amyloid (βA) plaques

Methods
Details of the experimental protocols, including chemicals, animals, novel object recognition test (NORT), biochemical and molecular methods, target engagement, drug properties characterization, and statistical analysis, are given in the Supplemental information.

Results
Changes in sEH Expression in the Hippocampus from AD Patients, SAMP8, and 5XFAD
The key question was to determine whether sEH expression differs from healthy to pathological conditions.
Results demonstrated that sEH levels were higher in AD patients' brains (Braak III and V) in comparison with those of healthy individuals (Table

The arachidonic acid (AA) cascade is a group of metabolic pathways in which AA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids are the central molecules.
Metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways gives rise to largely proinflammatory and proalgesic metabolites.
Both pathways have been pharmaceutically targeted.
CYP enzymes either hydroxylate or epoxidize AA leading to hydroxyeicosatetranoic acids (HETEs) or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), respectively.
The latter compounds, which are endowed with potent antiinflammatory properties, are rapidly subjected to hydrolysis to their corresponding diols by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme.
Inhibitors of sEH block this degradation and stabilize EET levels in vivo
They also reduce the corresponding diols which have some inflammatory properties.
Major CYPs that oxidize AA are listed in the figure, but many others make a contribution was also elevated in SAMP8 and 5XFAD hippocampus in comparison with to their respective controls (Fig.

On-Target Drug Inhibition of sEH
We evaluated 3 structurally different sEH inhibitors as chemical probes
Previous pharmacokinetic data suggest that TPPU, a very well characterized sEH inhibitor, can enter into the brain
It is known that AS-2586114 has a prolonged action in vivo and an ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
UB-EV-52 is a new inhibitor somewhat related with previously reported adamantane-derived sEH inhibitors such as t-AUCB
To determine whether UB-EV-52 possesses drug-like characteristics, we performed in vitro ADMET assays.
We found that UB-EV-52 has excellent solubility (> 100 μM at 37 °C in 5% DMSO: 95% PBS buffer) and good microsomal stability (Table
Of relevance, some cytochromes are potential off-target effects of sEH (Fig.
UB-EV-52 showed less than 5% inhibition of the studied cytochromes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6) at 10 μM (Table
As a preliminary assessment of brain permeability, UB-EV-52 was subjected to the parallel artificial membrane permeation assay-BBB (PAMPA-BBB), a well-established in vitro model of passive transcellular permeation
UB-EV-52 was predicted to be able to cross the BBB (Table
In order to characterize the toxicity of UB-EV-52, we evaluated cell viability in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, using an MTT assay for cell metabolic activity and a propidium iodide stain assay for cell death.
In both assays, UB-EV-52 showed no cytotoxicity at 1, 10, 50, and 100 μM (Table
To evaluate whether sEH is the direct binding target of the inhibitors in brain tissue, we performed an in vivo thermal shift assay (CETSA)
The results showed a significant shift in the sEH melting curve in the hippocampus of CD-1 mice orally treated with TPPU, AS-2586114, and UB-EV-52, demonstrating in vivo compound-induced target stabilization, providing also evidence of central action (Fig.
To demonstrate that the tested compounds reduced sEH activity, we measured levels of regulatory lipid mediators in the cortex of treated and control SAMP8 mice.
As shown in Fig.
At the same time, the anti-inflammatory epoxy fatty acids, including those from -linoleic acid (EpODE) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids, are all higher in the treated groups, especially in the TPPU-treated group.
These differences also verified the target engagement of inhibition of sEH in vivo.
Once demonstrated that the compounds tested were able to inhibit sEH at the brain level, we evaluated the pathological hallmarks and the cognitive impairment associated with AD in SAMP8 and 5XFAD.
sEH Inhibitors Reduce Biomarkers of Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Indicators of brain neuroinflammation were determined after oral treatment with TPPU (5 mg/kg/day), AS-2586114 (7.5 mg/kg/ day), and UB-EV-52 (5 mg/kg/day) (Fig.
The 3 inhibitors reduced gene expression and brain protein levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β (interleukin-β), CCL3 (C-C motif ligand 3), and, importantly, TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) in SAMP8 (Fig.
IL-1β is intimately involved in neuroinflammatory processes in the CNS
Chemokines play a critical role in phagocytic activity.
Concretely, CCL3 is expressed in astrocytes and is described as a component of the inflammasome complex
Of note, TNF-α not only is involved in AD-related brain neuroinflammation
Additionally, these results suggest an involvement of the 2 main inflammasome-signaling pathways, NF-kβ and NLRP3
To investigate the influence of the sEH inhibitors in the oxidative stress process, we determined the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the brain of SAMP8 mice.
The 3 inhibitors significantly reduce hydrogen peroxide (Fig.
Moreover, determination of the brain oxidative machinery was addressed by evaluating the gene expression of Hmox1, Aox1, and protein levels of SOD1 (Fig.
Hmox1 (antioxidant activity)
qPCR analysis also demonstrated that treated SAMP8 mice had lower Aox1 expression (Fig.
Aox1 controls the production of hydrogen peroxide, and under certain conditions, can catalyze the formation of superoxide
Furthermore, SOD1 (antioxidant activity) protein levels were significantly increased in all treated groups (Fig.
By contrast, in 5XFAD, a model with reduced oxidative stress, no significant changes were determined in oxidative stress parameters evaluated (data not shown).
It is known that the ER stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD
Therefore, we measured the levels of the ER stress sensors ATF-6 and IRE1α (Fig.
Especially, UB-EV-52 was able to reduce the levels of either protein.
Furthermore, we evaluated XBP1, a major regulator of the unfolded protein response, which is induced by ER stress
XBP1 was significantly reduced by UB-EV-52 and slightly decreased by AS-2586114, but not by TPPU (Fig.
Altogether, these results suggest that the inhibition of

sEH Inhibitors Modify the 2 Main Physiopathological Hallmarks of AD
The brains of patients with AD contain 2 main physiopathological hallmarks: tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and βA plaques.
As mentioned, considering that SAMP8 has disturbances in tau hyperphosphorylation and APP processing but lacks βA plaques, 5XFAD was used to support the protective effect of sEHI in AD hallmarks studied.
On the one hand, after oral treatment of SAMP8 and 5XFAD mice with TPPU (5 mg/kg/day), AS-2586114 (7.5 mg/kg/day), and UB-EV-52 (5 mg/kg/day), sEH inhibition provoked a reduction of the tau hyperphosphorylated species (Ser396 and Ser404), especially Ser404 (Fig.
On the other hand, we examined the ability of the sEHI to modify the amyloid processing cascade.
Whereas the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model develops early aggressive hallmarks of amyloid burden and cognitive loss
Importantly, C-terminal fragment (CTF) levels are strongly implicated in neurodegeneration and the cognitive decline process in SAMP8
We observed a substantial decrease in the ratio of CTFs/APP protein levels in both mice models after treatment with sEHI (Fig.
In addition, an increase of the sAPPα and a decrease of sAPPβ supported that sEHI are able to shift the APP processing towards the nonamyloidogenic pathway, thereby reducing the probability of increasing βA aggregation.
Finally, treatment of 5XFAD mice with sEHI had a strong effect in reducing the number of βA plaques stained with thioflavin-S (by an average of 40%) (Fig.

sEH Inhibitors Reduce Cognitive Impairment
To demonstrate the efficacy on the cognitive decline of the sEH inhibitors, we performed a NORT to obtain a measure of cognition for short-and long-term memory.
Treatment of both murine models with the 3 sEH inhibitors drastically increased the discrimination index (DI).
The significant increase indicates clear preservation of both memories (Fig.
In both models, we add a comparator arm of mice treated with donepezil, which is a standard of care in the treatment of AD.
As expected, donepezil treatment (5 mg/kg/day) also shifted the DI to values significantly higher than zero.
Remarkably, in all the conditions, the sEH inhibitors reduced cognitive decline better than donepezil.

Discussion
Our results suggest that the pharmacological stabilization of EETs in the brain has the potential to address multiple etiologies and physiopathological processes of AD, i.e., neuroinflammation, ER stress, and oxidative stress, increasing the chances of success of future therapies based on sEH inhibition.
Although the decisive role of sEH inhibition in multiple inflammation-related diseases has been studied, only a few investigations have been conducted about its crucial role in the neuroinflammation process
Besides, the question of if neuroinflammation is the malicious driver or "just" a consequence still represents an important conundrum in the AD field.
Our findings reinforce the idea that neuroinflammation might drive the pathogenic process in AD.
A partial correlation calculation has demonstrated that the antiinflammatory effects of sEH inhibitors correspond with changes in AD hallmarks, slowing the progression of the disease and pushing up the cognitive capabilities in the studied animal models (Fig.
A characteristic feature of acute inflammatory processes is a general increase in the levels of classic proinflammatory eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes).
In neurodegenerative diseases, there is a basal, chronic, and silent inflammation that is more related to a disbalance in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as those studied IL-1β
Importantly in our landscape, βA activates inflammasomes that, in turn, mediate IL-1β maturation in microglial cells
This allowed us to anticipate different biological and therapeutic outcomes for sEH inhibition than for the COX and LOX pathway inhibition.
Two structurally different sEH inhibitors have been proven to be safe in human clinical trials for other peripheral indications (AR9281 for hypertension and GSK2256294 for diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, and subarachnoid hemorrhage)

See partial correlations between selected variables in Fig.
This fact, undoubtedly, accelerates the development of new sEHI for the treatment of AD and avoids uncertainties about the possibility of angiogenic effects when inhibiting sEH.
Of relevance, for this study, we have employed 3 structurally different sEH inhibitors, supporting the hypothesis that the biological outcomes observed are not because of off-target effects related to a particular inhibitor.
In summary, we have demonstrated that sEH levels are altered in AD mouse models and, more importantly, in the brain of AD patients.
We have further shown that the inhibition of sEH has a plethora of beneficial central effects, such as reducing inflammation, ER stress, oxidative stress markers, ptau pathology, and the amyloid burden.
Consequently, sEHI improves the functional efficacy endpoint for cognitive status in neurodegeneration and AD animal models.
The anti-inflammatory effect of sEHI has been demonstrated in different pathologies
Nevertheless, considering the results obtained in this work, we cannot rule out the beneficial effects of inhibition of sEH by
a Short-term memory evaluation after 2 h acquisition trial by discrimination index and b long-term memory evaluation after 24 h acquisition trial by discrimination index after exposure to novel objects.
Results are expressed as a mean ± SEM and were significantly different from the control group.
Groups were compared by Student t test or by 1-way ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett's, n = 12 per group (*significant at p < 0.05, **significant at p < 0.01, ***significant at p < 0.001, and ****significant at p < 0.0001).
See partial correlations between selected variables in Fig.
Those effects should be implicated in the β-amyloid plaque removal and tau hyperphosphorylation reduction.
Based on the results presented in this work, we firmly believe that inhibitors of sEH could represent an entirely new standalone treatment for the treatment of AD.
However, herein, we do not demonstrate, because is it beyond the scope of this study, if inhibition of sEH could also represent an add-on therapy together with more symptomatic-like drugs, i.e., donepezil.
