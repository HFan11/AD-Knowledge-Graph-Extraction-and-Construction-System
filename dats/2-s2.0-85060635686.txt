The current understanding of overlap between characteristics of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and Alzheimer’s disease
The advent of effective antiretroviral medications (ARVs) has led to an aging of the HIV population with approximately 50% of people with HIV (PWH) being over the age of 50 years.
Neurocognitive complications, typically known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), persist in the era of ARVs and, in addition to risk of HAND, older PWH are also at risk for age-associated, neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
It has been postulated that risk for AD may be greater among PWH due to potential compounding effects of HIVand aging on mechanisms of neural insult.
We are now faced with the challenge of disentangling AD from HAND, which has important prognostic and treatment implications given the more rapidly debilitating trajectory of AD.
Herein, we review the evidence to date demonstrating both parallels and differences in the profiles of HAND and AD.
We specifically address similarities and difference of AD and HAND as it relates to (1) neuropsychological profiles (cross-sectional/longitudinal), (2) AD-associated neuropathological features as evidenced from neuropathological, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging assessments, (3) biological mechanisms underlying cortical amyloid deposition, (4) parallels in mechanisms of neural insult, and (5) common risk factors.
Our current understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities of AD and HAND should be further delineated and leveraged in the development of differential diagnostic methods that will allow for the early identification of AD and more suitable and effective treatment interventions among graying PWH.
With increased effectiveness of antiretrovirals (ARVs), HIV has shifted from a deadly disease with an aggressive time course to a chronic disease with increased longevity.
Presently, one half of people living with HIV (PWH) in the USA are over 50 years of age and life expectancy among ARV-treated adults is approaching that of the general population
The Bgraying of the HIV epidemic^has introduced new challenges including increasing rates of age and inflammation-related comorbidities including central nervous system (CNS) complications.
Currently, one of the most common CNS complications is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND)
Rates of the milder forms of HAND, asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) and mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) persist, if not increased in the post-ARV era
With increased survival of older PWH, there is an increased likelihood that some will also suffer from common age-associated disorders including neurodegenerative dementias and their precursor stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Because Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementing condition, this review focuses specifically on AD, which includes both MCI and Alzheimer's-type dementia.
Older PWH may be particularly at risk for age-associated, neurodegenerative diseases including AD given evidence of synergistic effects of HIV and aging on the brain
Some evidence suggests premature or accelerated aging phenotypes among PWH
For example, age-associated conditions appear 5-10 years earlier in PWH versus the general population
Using an epigenetic prediction of age based on DNA methylation levels, PWH demonstrate accelerated aging of 7.4 years in brain tissue and 5 years in peripheral blood versus HIV-uninfected (HIV-) persons
Further supporting accelerated aging among PWH,

Evidence of PWH with AD
Presently, evidence of a probable/possible AD diagnosis in PWH, either alone or in conjunction with HAND, is derived mostly from case studies
In the case of a 71-year-old man living with HIV for 14 years, an AD-like profile was indicated by clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments
His family reported that he had mild short-term memory problems for the past 5 years with insidious onset and a noticeable decline in the past 3 years.
He also demonstrated similar alterations in restingstate functional connectivity as seen in HIV-individuals with MCI (n = 8) or mild Alzheimer's-type dementia (n = 14) versus 42 age-matched cognitively normal individuals.
Moreover, [18F]florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) imaging demonstrated marked cortical amyloid-β (Aβ 42 ) plaque deposits, a hallmark neuropathological characteristic of AD
In a second case, a 70year-old woman presented with memory complaints.
PET imaging detected abnormal phosphorylation of the tau protein (p-tau) in the women, which leads to another AD neuropathological hallmark, neurofibrillary tangles
Recently, two virally-suppressed female cases (52 and 81 years old) demonstrated AD neuropathology and age-related tau astrogliopathy.
Consistent with AD, the 52year-old demonstrated severe learning, memory, and daily function impairment; however, the 81-year-old was managing all actives of daily living
One clinical study demonstrated that PWH were over seven times more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for MCI than HIVindividuals
Importantly, MCI diagnosis was associated with older age and mild declines in activities of daily living but not with HIV-related clinical factors.
The minimal evidence of PWH with diagnosed possible/ probable AD may be an artifact of the fact that most cohorts of PWH are middle aged rather than older.
The majority of largescale, longitudinal, cohort studies including the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) have focused on mid-life (~40 years old) or younger.
Large-scale data will continue to emerge over the next decade with continued follow-up of MACS and WIHS individuals into their 50s and 60s.
Also, multiple prospective, cohort studies with a focus on aging among PWH have commenced including the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, the Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Observations in People Over Fifty (POPPY), and a 12-year follow-up study of individuals enrolled in CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study.
As more PWH reach an age where they are at risk for traditional dementias, clinicians should assess for AD in older PWH, and researchers will benefit from prioritizing longitudinal studies of older PWH measuring AD-related markers.

Importance of distinguishing between HAND and AD
Given that half of PWH are over 50 years old (CDC 2017) and ~45% of PWH are diagnosed with HAND
Clinicians and researchers are faced with a new challenge of distinguishing between early signs of AD and mild forms of HAND.
Typical protocols for diagnosing AD including neurocognitive, neurological, and neuroimaging assessments have not yet been tested in the context of PWH.
Distinguishing between AD and HAND is important for both clinical and experimental reasons.
Clinically, the more degenerative profile of AD requires different life planning and treatment options versus the HAND profile in which neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is typically more stable
A delayed AD diagnosis in PWH would limit the opportunity to intervene early in the course of AD when interventions are most effective and life planning can be better implemented.
Experimentally, the identification of AD among PWH will lead to more accurate prevalence estimates of HAND and will improve studies examining biomarker, imaging, and genetic correlates of HAND.

Parallels and differences in profiles of HAND and AD
Table

Neuropsychological profiles
Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is the MCI subtype that is specifically associated with increased risk of progression to Alzheimer'stype dementia
There is considerable overlap in the neuropsychological profiles of aMCI and the milder forms of HAND.
Both conditions are defined by mild impairment (neuropsychological scores 1-1.5 SD below normative mean) and with none-to-mild difficulties in everyday function.
aMCI is characterized specifically by episodic memory deficits
There are also important differences between aMCI and HAND that may allow us to better distinguish the conditions including the type and trajectory of memory deficits.
For example, aMCI is characterized by hippocampal-based

Neuropsychological

Normal recall & recognition performance
Poor recall but normal recognition performance
Conversely, evidence suggests a more Bsubcortical^pattern of NCI in HAND including processing speed, executive function, and memory retrieval deficits but relatively normal memory storage and retention in the pre (i.e., impaired recall but intact recognition)
This cortical versus sub-cortical distinction was recently evidenced in a study where a combination of six neuropsychological tests discriminated aMCI from mild HAND with 86% accuracy

AD-associated neuropathological features in HIV

Neuropathology studies
Studies suggest commonalities in the neuropathological processes underlying AD and HAND.
The hallmark pathological characteristics of AD, Aβ 42 plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles are observed in normal aging
Aβ 42 plaque deposition is an initial event in the AD trajectory that can occur more than a decade before clinical symptoms
Aβ 42 plaque deposits are also observed in the brains of HIV+ post-mortem cases, particularly older cases
Similar to AD, plaque deposition is found in mid-temporal and frontal lobe regions in PWH
Aβ 42 plaque type and deposition pattern also differs between HIV and AD.
Whereas Aβ 42 plaques in AD are predominantly neuritic, associated with abnormal neural/glial function and deposited extracellularly, the plaques in HIV are typically Bdiffuse^and deposited intracellularly (e.g., neuronal soma and axonal tracks)
These plaque differences do not necessarily discriminate AD from HAND-related neuropathology given that diffuse plaques are thought to be the precursor to neuritic plaques and they are consistently observed in Down's Syndrome patients who inevitably develop AD if their lifespan allows
Thus, it is unclear whether the intraneuronal, diffuse plaques in HIV are associated with AD but manifest differently in the context of HIVor whether they reflect a different disease process.
The research examining p-tau and neurofibrillary tangles PWH is sparse.
In one neuropathological study, higher p-tau levels were found specifically in the frontal cortex tissue of 8 PWH with HIV encephalitis (HIVE) versus 8 PWH without HIVE
In the HIVE cases, p-tau levels were positively correlated with the expression of CDK5 and p35; kinases that contribute to atypical phosphorylation of neural substrates and neuronal death when abnormally activated.
In another study, elevated levels of p-tau were observed in the hippocampus of 29 HIV+ cases compared to seven age-matched, HIV-cases with the highest levels reported in ARV-treated cases

Cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging studies
Changes in Aβ 42 and p-tau can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and by PET imaging as an early surrogate marker of pathology.
Lower levels of CSF Aβ 42 indicate greater cortical deposition of Aβ 42 plaques
The literature regarding CSF levels of Aβ 42 in PWH is equivocal with some reporting no differences between HIV-individuals and ARV-treated
In one study comparing HIV-individuals with Alzheimer's-type dementia (n = 20) and without NCI (n = 20) and HIV+ individuals with AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC, another term for HAD; n = 87) and without NCI (n 30), CSF Aβ 42 levels in those with ADC were lower than both HIV+ and HIV-participants without NCI and comparable to the HIV-Alzheimer's-type dementia patients
Disparate findings may be due to small samples and differences in age and severity of HAND whereby Aβ 42 is more common among older PWH with moderate-to-severe impairment.
Fewer studies use amyloid PET imaging to detect Aβ 42 plaques in PWH and, in contrast to CSF findings, these post-ARV era studies report no evidence of elevated extracellular amyloid fibrillar deposits in PWH that are cognitively normal
Disparities between CSF and PET findings of Aβ 42 deposition may reflect the differences in Aβ 42 plaque characteristics and deposition in HAND versus AD.
Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET measures the extracellular fibrillar deposits that are common to AD, and thus may not detect the deposits in HIV that are typically intracellular and diffuse
Although it is unclear if or how the Aβ 42 plaques in PWH relate to AD pathological mechanisms, these studies suggest that altered amyloid metabolism is common to AD and HIV.
In contrast to the neuropathological finding in HIVE cases
Studies included comparisons among older and younger HIV-individuals with and without AD and older and younger PWH that were either neuroasymptomatic and untreated, ARV-treated, or diagnosed with HAND
Conversely,
Disparate results may be due to differences in the age range, severity of HAND, time period when cases were gathered, and treatment history of study samples.
The detection of cortical tau tangles via PET has yet to be examined in HIV except in the aforementioned case study of the 70-year-old patient with HIVE.
Consistent with neuropathological findings in HIVE
Taken together, these limited findings suggest that p-tau may be a shared pathologic process specifically between AD and HIVE.
AD is also characterized by markers of cellular and synaptic integrity.
Neurogranin (Ng) is a marker of synaptic loss
Biofluid levels of Ng has not been examined in relation to HAND; however, Ng mRNA was found to be significantly downregulated in PBMCs of PWH with high viral loads compared to demographically-matched, HIV-controls
Elevated CSF levels of neurofilament light (NfL) is a marker of axonal injury that has been reported in multiple types of neurodegenerative disorders including AD
Cell death and brain atrophy are also neuropathologic characteristics of AD particularly in the temporal lobe and other cortical structures
Brain atrophy is also associated with HAND
Machine learning approaches demonstrate utility in distinguishing HAND from MCI among older (aged 60-70 years) PWH and HIV-individuals using brain morphometry data
Consistent with the cortical-(AD) versus subcortical-based (HAND) dementia distinction, the combination of volume estimates that best distinguished HAND from MCI in the post-ARV era was in cortical and subcortical brain regions that subserve episodic memory, executive function, and fine motor tasks including medial orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, and parahippocampal volume

Biological mechanisms underlying cortical Aβ 42 deposition in HIV versus AD
Although cortical Aβ 42 deposition is found in both AD and older PWH, the mechanism underlying the deposition may differ in HIV and AD.
Whereas AD is predominantly an auto Bproteopathic^neurodegenerative disorder
In HIV, several steps in the synthesis and clearance of Aβ 42 are disrupted by viral proteins and blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise
For instance, the viral protein gp120 alters transcription of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by triggering neural injury and microglial activation
The viral protein Tat promotes Aβ 42 aggregation by inhibiting neprilysin, the primary enzyme in Aβ 42 degradation
Increases in cortical Aβ 42 deposition are also associated with longer durations of ARVs, particularly with protease inhibitors
Certain ARVs such as protease inhibitors and efavirenz inhibit the expression of P-glycoprotein expression, which contributes to the clearance of Aβ 42 from the brain
Evidence of a shared precursor step to cortical Aβ 42 deposition in HAND and AD lies in the β-site Aβ precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and 2 (BACE2), a beta-secretase enzyme that cleaves APP and can lead to an overproduction of Aβ 42 oligomers that aggregate into plaques
Elevated levels of BACE enzymatic activity are found in all AD stages
Similarly, studies report elevated levels of BACE1 enzymatic activity, Aβ 42 oligomers
Findings implicate BACE as a common mechanism underlying AD and HAND Aβ 42 deposition and highlight its broad therapeutic potential.

Parallels in mechanisms of neural insult in HAND and AD
Certain mechanisms of neural injury are common to both HIV and AD as well as aging in general including chronic, lowgrade inflammation, immune senescence, mitochondria dysfunction, compromised BBB
In a proteomic profiling study in postmortem HIV+ cases,
Over 90% of the identified proteins also show differential expression patterns in AD, with the large majority reflecting energy metabolism (mitochondria) and signal transduction pathways.
Increasing evidence implicates chronic inflammation and immune activation in the accelerated aging and in the development of ageassociated, non AIDS conditions, including AD, in PWH.
In HIV and AD, chronic inflammation is triggered by activated microglia and astrocytes
Growing evidence also implicates TREM2 in AD-and HAND-related pathogenic mechanisms likely due to its role in regulating neuroinflammation and in phagocytizing extra-cellular Aβ plaques.
Decreased levels of membrane-enriched TREM2 were found in the brain tissue of HIV+ cases with HAND versus without HAND in the post-cART era
A meta-analytic study reported higher levels of soluble TREM2 (indicating greater neuroinflammation) in the prodromal AD stages
In AD, a high Aβ 42 plaque burden can activate microglia
In HIV, viral proteins, including tat and gp120, trigger an immune response and inflammation through the release of host-derived cytokines and chemokines (Kovalevich and Langford 2012).
Monocytedriven inflammatory markers in particular (e.g., sCD163, sCD14) have been strongly linked to NCI among PWH
Neuroinflammation is observed even in virally-suppressed PWH
In fact, ARV-treated PWH show high levels of neuroinflammation, particularly in the hippocampus, a brain region that shows early AD-related changes
Furthermore, immune reconstitution syndrome in long-term, ARV-treated PWH involves recovered immune cells attacking previously-acquired opportunistic infections with an excessive inflammatory response that can contribute to AD pathology either directly or indirectly through subsequent conditions such as vasculitis
It remains unclear whether the concurrence of HIV, ARVs, and aging leads to compounding inflammatory pathways that make PWH more vulnerable to AD in general and/ or to an earlier onset and more rapid trajectory.

Risk factors common to both HAND and AD
Certain demographic, clinical and genetic factors have been independently associated with increased risk of HAND and AD including, but not limited to, older age, vascular abnormalities, neuropsychiatric characteristics, and APOE-ɛ4 carrier status.
First, older age is the strongest risk factor for AD and is also associated with a greater likelihood of HAND
Germane to potential manifestations of AD, older age (> 50 years) was associated with a 4 to 5 fold increased odds of memory impairment
Several studies, but not all
Second, vascular disorders including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and obesity are well-established risk factors for AD
HIV-related biological mechanisms and ARV medications are associated with hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, abnormalities in body fat distribution and, in turn, these conditions are associated with a higher likelihood of HAND
These vascular conditions are likely linked to AD and HAND through similar mechanisms of inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and/or oxidative stress
Evidence also suggests that depression is associated with HAND
Last, the APOE-ɛ4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD and is linked with earlier AD onset and greater degree of cortical Aβ 42 burden
Although not consistently
A family history of dementia has also been implicated in the development of HAND
In a post-mortem study, APOE-ɛ4 genotype moderated the relationship between the presence of Aβ 42 plaques and increased likelihood of HAND, whereby this relationship was observed in APOE-ɛ4 carriers but not in non-carriers
In conclusion, the rising rate of older PWH presents a major public health concern for the manifestation and possible exacerbation of AD in the context of HIV infection.
Multiple biological and neuropsychological features are common to AD and HAND (e.g., episodic memory deficits, chronic inflammation, Aβ 42 plaques), and thus present a challenge in identifying AD among PWH.
Although NCI observed among PWH is typically classified as HAND because of their HIV disease, the true source of impairment may be AD or a combination of HIVand AD pathologies in a subset of older PWH.
Similarly, AD pathological hallmarks have been observed in PWH although their manifestation differs in some ways from AD.
Thus, it is unclear whether these pathological processes are associated with HAND or AD.
Further complicating matters, certain risk factors are common to AD and HAND and some result from HIV itself or ARVs such as vascular abnormalities and insulin resistance.
Research is needed to determine whether these common risk factors and overlapping disease processes interact mechanistically to exacerbate both AD and HAND.
There are some known differences (e.g., ADspecific recognition memory deficits, p-tau biomarker) and possibly currently-unexplored differences in the biological and clinical profiles of AD and HAND.
Research is warranted to further dissociate these AD and HAND profiles and leverage these differences to develop differential diagnostic procedures that can distinguish these phenotypes.
Identifying AD in PWH has vast clinical implications.
If AD in PWH is erroneously attributed solely to HAND, then this limits and possibly prevents the opportunity to intervene early in the course of AD when pharmaceutical and cognitive interventions as well as care, financial and legal planning are most effective and better implemented.
Alternatively, the identification of convergent pathophysiological pathways in AD and HAND may represent opportunities for common therapeutic interventions to AD and HAND and other neurodegenerative diseases.
