The complexity of tau in Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two major pathological lesions in the brain, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed mainly of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively.
Although accumulation of toxic Aβ species in the brain has been proposed as one of the important early events in AD, continued lack of success of clinical trials based on Aβ-targeting drugs has triggered the field to seek out alternative disease mechanisms and related therapeutic strategies.
One of the new approaches is to uncover novel roles of pathological tau during disease progression.
This review will primarily focus on recent advances in understanding the contributions of tau to AD.

Introduction 1.A brief historical review
NFTs were first described as one of the major brain lesions in AD by Alois Alzheimer in 1907
It wasn't until 1985 that the primary component of NFTs was identified as tau, a microtubule associated protein that is expressed primarily in neurons
Hyperphosphorylation of tau in NFTs was documented soon after
See Fig.
The importance of tau in AD progression has been recognized by clinical studies of the close correlation between AD development with tau-positive NFTs and neuropil threads, defined as tau-tangle filaments in areas of the brain that are high in neuronal and glial processes but lacking in cell bodies
Both NFTs and neuropil threads begin in the transentorhinal region in the medial temporal lobar structures and progress to the neocortex and allocortex
The number of NFT-positive cells correlates with disease stages, as measured by clinical parameters for cognitive decline and disease severity
Besides AD, NFTs have been identified in over 20 different neurodegenerative diseases collectively termed "tauopathies"
With the exception of AD, most of these diseases occur without amyloid deposition, and many are associated with tau mutations, suggesting that tau dysfunction and/or tangle formation contributes to the etiology of disease.

Characteristics of tau
Tau is encoded on chromosome 17 by the MAPT gene, which produces an overall hydrophilic protein with large natively unfolded regions enriched in the axons of developing and mature neurons
Alternative splicing of 8 of the total 16 exons yields 6 isoforms in the central nervous system (CNS) and 6 additional isoforms in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), ranging from 58 kDa to 66 kDa and one 110 kDa isoform
Tau protein is comprised of four primary domains (Fig.
Alternative splicing primarily affects the N-terminal projection region and microtubule-binding domain (MBD), producing 4repeat (4R) and 3-repeat (3R) tau.
These two isoforms are maintained in a balanced ratio
4R tau demonstrates a stronger activity in promoting microtubule assembly than 3R tau does
Disruption of 3R and 4R ratio has been implicated in AD as well as other tauopathies and extensively reviewed elsewhere
In brief, the ratio of 4R to 3R tau is increased in progressive supranuclear palsy
No clear pattern has emerged in AD
The most studied function of tau is its role in promoting microtubule assembly and stability, mainly supported by studies using in vitro cell-free systems
However, knockout or knockdown of tau in mouse models and in primary neurons does not impair microtubule assembly or axonal transport
The knockout mice do not have a severe phenotype, suggesting that the normal functions of tau might be compensated by various microtubule associated proteins (e.g., MAP1A, MAP1B, MAP2, etc.)
Similar to tau knockout mouse brains (specifically axons) that develop normally, humans bearing disease-causing tau mutations or complete disruption are also developmentally normal
In light of these unclear phenotypes in mice, in humans, a few individuals with microdeletions of the chromosome region containing MAPT and a few other genes, resulting in a 50% reduction in tau levels, do exhibit some delayed developmental issues in the CNS
Nevertheless, a clear neuron-specific function for this protein is yet to emerge.
The field would benefit from identifying non-redundant tau functions that are not developmentally important but can either 1) contribute to long-term cell survival functions that are essential for non-dividing cells like neurons, or 2) set off a cascade of events that may lead to neuronal death later in life.
To date, over 60 disease-causing mutations in tau have been identified, accounting for ~5% of all FTD cases
These mutations, which are numbered by their locations in 2N4R human tau
Studies of these mutations show that they directly impact tau post-translational modifications, protein folding and aggregation, likely leading to toxic gain-of-function.
We will discuss tau toxicity by reviewing recent advances in the consequences of tau posttranslational modifications, particularly in the context of synaptic dysfunction, aggregation and propagation of tau.
We will also discuss the emerging roles of glia in tauopathy, new 3D modeling systems for studying tau, and the development of tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracers.

Tau and synaptic function
Memory deficits in AD are highly associated with synaptic defects in the hippocampus
Tau, as a promoter of axonal microtubule assembly, has been proposed to play a role in maintaining neuronal projections and affecting synaptic function.
Loss of tau binding to microtubules may therefore contribute to synaptic dysfunction.
Although tau knockout mice and flies do not exhibit any overt phenotypes
Consistently, tau knockdown in the adult hippocampus impairs motor coordination and causes morphological synaptic defects
Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation are associated with impaired long-term synaptic plasticity and short-term plasticity.
In the hippocampus of numerous transgenic tau mouse models expressing human wild type tau (hTau and triple transgenic PLB1), tau mutants (including P301 L, K257 T/P301S, Tau RD ΔK280 expressing pro-aggregated 4R fragment K18) or a model of geneticallyinduced tau hyperphosphorylation by the PP2A inhibitor CIP2A, long-term potentiation (LTP) is reduced at an age correlated with an increase in tau phosphorylation and aggregation
Furthermore, LTP is reduced in mouse hippocampal slices by tau oligomers extracted from AD patient brains independent of soluble Aβ oligomers
Reducing tau phosphorylation by inhibiting tau kinases restores tau-dependent LTP deficits and attenuates synaptic loss in tau transgenic mice
It is unclear how tau mechanistically maintains synaptic plasticity, or how pathogenic versions of tau impair it.
Several possible mechanisms might be involved.
At the presynapse, pathogenic tau may interfere with normal synaptic vesicle release.
Although tau protein was not found in the murine synaptic vesicle proteome by mass spectrometry
This interaction may be mediated through the synaptic vesicle-anchored transmembrane protein synaptogyrin-3
The outcome of this pathogenic association may cluster F-actin at the presynapse and physically impede synaptic vesicle release, resulting in decreased neurotransmission
On the other side of the synapse, normal tau is found to be involved in normal synaptic activity in the postsynaptic compartment
Normal tau mainly associates with microtubules in axons, but it can be recruited to dendrites and at the post-synapse under physiological or pathological conditions (recently reviewed by
Synaptic activity drives tau to postsynaptic densities, where tau interacts with postsynaptic density proteins
Dendritic tau is mostly hyperphosphorylated
In AD or other taupathies, these dendritic tau species play important roles in dendritic loss, aberant postsynaptic activity and cognitive dysfunction
The molecular mechanisms likely involve regulation of NMDA or AMPA receptors, for example, dendritic tau has been shown to mediate Aβdependent excitotoxicity by complexing with Fyn kinase to trigger NMDA receptor phosphorylation
In tau models, AMPA-mediated currents are suppressed in dendritic spines
This defect may be attributed to hyperacetylated tau, which disrupts AMPA receptor trafficking during plasticity by reducing KIBRA levels at synapses
It remains unclear whether hyperphosphorylated tau disrupts AMPA receptor stability at synapses.

Post-translational modifications of tau

Phosphorylation
Tau phosphorylation has been heavily implicated in AD and extensively studied, mainly because NFTs purified from AD brains are enriched with highly phosphorylated tau species.
Biochemical characterization of tau phosphorylation at disease-related sites demonstrates that phosphorylation reduces tau's ability to bind to microtubules
Mass spectrometry analysis of tau filaments led to identification of numerous pathological tau phospho-sites
To date, approximately 45 out of 85 potential phosphorylation sites in tau have been reported experimentally.
Some of these sites are differentially phosphorylated in AD or FTD brains but not in controls.
Tau phosphorylation in the context of AD and other tauopathies has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, and therefore is not discussed further here

Acetylation
Tau is a lysine-rich protein, particularly in the region spanning the MBD.
Acetylation of tau was first described by Min and colleagues as a novel post-translational modification
Tau acetylation at some specific lysine residues is associated with AD pathology in patient brains even at early .
Multiple lysine residues in endogenous mouse tau have been identified to be acetylated by mass spectrometry analysis in both wild type and APP transgenic mice
The histone acetyltransferases (HAT) p300
Protein acetylation at lysine residues serves as an important regulatory mechanism for enzymatic activity, protein-protein interaction and protein stability
Mimicking tau acetylation with glutamine (tauKQ) at lysines 174 and 280 slows down total tau turnover in PS19 transgenic mice and transgenic Drosophila, respectively, without altering soluble and insoluble tau levels in the latter
The relationship between tau acetylation and phosphorylation has been heavily investigated.
However, the interplay between these two kinds of modifications is complex, possibly residue-dependent and disease-specific.
The distribution of acetylated tau resembles that of hyperphosphorylated tau in AD brains
Although phosphorylation is generally assumed to precede acetylation in AD pathology, acetylation of lysine 280 actually precedes phosphorylation in chronic traumatic encephalopathy
Acetylation of tau at certain lysines
The influence of tau acetylation on aggregation is not conclusive yet and also seems residuespecific.
Recent studies propose that acetylation precedes aggregation, yet it is unclear if acetylation promotes, protects against, or is unrelated to aggregation propensity, as acetylation within the MBD alters the structure of tau such that it may be either more or less prone to aggregation
Acetylation at certain residues promotes tau aggregation and makes it more vulnerable to template-directed misfolding
Acetylated tau at lysine 280 within the MBD is specifically associated with insoluble tau in AD brain and both PS19 and PS19/PDAPP mouse models
On the other hand, acetylation of tau is associated with decreased aggregation in some models.
For example, CBP-mediated acetylation at lysine 321 inhibits recombinant tau fibril formation
These findings are consistent with one of the earlier studies that tau aggregation is prevented by acetylation in the KIGS motif, which is hypoacetylated and hyperphosphorylated in AD brain and the P301L mouse model; therefore, loss of acetylation at this site is detrimental
Tau acetylation may be harmful by accounting for a possible loss-of-function mechanism.
Tau acetylation may disrupt microtubule assembly by altering the structure and charge within the
In support, pharmacological HDAC6 inhibition increases tau acetylation
Another detrimental outcome of tau acetylation is synaptic dysfunction.
A Drosophila model of tau acetylation (K163/280/281/369Q) and a mouse model of Aβ-induced tau acetylation exhibit memory impairment and locomotor dysfunction
Double acetyl-mimic at AD-related sites lysines 274 and 281 leads to tau mislocalization to somatodendritic compartments in primary cultures
Tau acetyl-mimics induce loss of postsynaptic protein KIBRA and reduce AMPA receptor trafficking, which may imply the underlying molecular mechanism
The effect of acetylated tau on synaptic deficits has been reviewed by

Pathological aggregation and propagation of tau
Tau aggregation is the overt pathological hallmark of tauopathies.
It still needs to be clarified whether the toxic species are the insoluble aggregates, pre-fibril soluble tau oligomers, fragments of already-formed aggregates, or the loss of soluble tau that is leeched into aggregates.
The lengthy period of cognitive decline in AD indicates that toxicity is a slow, cumulative process.
Likewise, formation of the initial aggregates occurs slowly, but subsequent fragmentation greatly facilitates formation of more aggregates
NFTs are concentrated in the brainstem nuclei, especially the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, in several tauopathies.
There is variable involvement of the basal ganglia, thalamus and cortex in various neurodegenerative diseases that present with tauopathy
In AD, tau pathology may appear at a younger age than senile plaques do
Braak suggests that tau pathology begins in the locus coeruleus and then spreads to other brainstem nuclei and to the entorhinal cortex.
Since the development of tau pathology in AD brain correlates well with the brain regions related to cognitive impairment, the Braak stages of AD are classified into stages I-VI using the spreading pattern of tau pathologies as one of the important criterion
Similar to the Braak stages, stereotypical temporospatial spreading of tau inclusions also occurs in other tauopathies such as argyrophilic grain disease.
A key difference between these tauopathies is that the spread of tau progresses in different directions and to different brain regions
Aberrant tau pathology follows a progressive pattern of spread in AD.
However, no clear mechanism of cell-to-cell tau spread has been elucidated.
Many studies over the past decade have demonstrated that tau is capable of spreading from one neuron to another.
Today, the study of tau aggregation is focusing on the structure of these aggregates, as well as the mechanisms of tau secretion, uptake and aggregate seeding by distinct pathological tau strains.

Aggregation
Intracellular tau aggregate formation is believed to be mediated by the MBD, spanning between Ser214 and Glu372
The MBD binds tightly to MTs and tethers tubulin dimers together
The third repeat, which contains the hexapeptide motif VQIVYK, is the most important for fibril assembly
This motif, along with a second hexapeptide motif (VQIINK), allows for formation of β-sheet structures that are necessary for tau aggregation
In support, structure-based inhibitors that target VQIINK, or introduction of β-sheet-breaking prolines in the MBD, prevent tau aggregate formation
Paired helical filaments and straight filaments in AD are morphologically heterogeneous but generally range in diameter from 22 to 24 nm as determined by electron microscopy
Advancements in structure-based technologies helped finally solve high-resolution structures of tau filaments.
Cryogenic electron microscopy revealed that a combined cross-β/ β-helix structure consisting of residues 306-378 within the MBD makes up the core of tau filaments derived from an AD patient brain
Variations in inter-protofilament packing between paired helical and straight filaments suggests that tau can adopt distinct folds in the human brain in different diseases
Multiple factors including tau phosphorylation and cleavage are early steps that precede aggregation.
One of the most significant findings regarding tau aggregation recently is that phosphorylation of tau promotes liquid-liquid phase separation under cellular protein conditions, resulting in molecular crowding of amyloid-promoting regions within the MBD that drives electrostatic amyloid-favoring coacervation
Tau can be cleaved by many proteases, which may promote tau aggregation
Aβ plaques are also capable of enhancing the aggregation of AD brain-derived tau injected into mouse brains
As Aβ plaques and tau tangles are spatially distinct in AD brain, both regionally in the brain and topologically across membranes, the question remains as to how exactly Aβ drives tau pathology.
Chaperone machinery provides a molecular mechanism involved in tau aggregation and degradation.
A class of chaperones, such as DnaJA2, Hsp60, clusterin, Hsp104 and Hsc70, demonstrates activities in inhibiting tau aggregation and seeding-capacity of tau aggregates
However, Hsp90, the most abundant chaperone in cells, shows a distinct function by promoting pathological tau stability and aggregation in the diseased state
It remains unclear whether these chaperones are able to reverse already-formed tau fibrils

Propagation
Early in 1997, an AD case study revealed that a disconnected frontal cortex tissue due to surgical removal in brain was completely lack of tau positive tangles or neuropil threads, indicating that the development of tau pathology involves cortico-cortical fibers
The spreading of tau from one cell to another long fibers conflicts with the biology of tau as an intracellular microtuble-binding protein.
More and more recent studies have shown that tau can be secreted from neurons
Tau is also detectable in the extracellular interstitial fluid from the brains of live mice using microdialysis technology, with a relatively long half-life of up to
Using co-culture systems, it was found that extracellular tau fibrils induce transmissible aggregation in recipient cells
The nature of secreted tau has not been fully characterized with consistent observations
Paradoxically, FTD mutations reduce tau secretion
Nevertheless, inoculation of pathological tau in tau transgenic mouse brains clearly demonstrates the transmission of tau pathology from one region to another
Tau oligomers derived from AD patients that are injected into wild type mouse hippocampus cause memory impairments and the spread of phospho-tau to other regions of the brain including the cortex, corpus callosum and hypothalamus
Confined expression of proaggregation P301 L tau in the entorhinal cortex using genetic approaches leads to anterograde spread to the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 regions in two regulatable tau mouse models
These mice suffer from loss of excitatory neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex which are associated with spatial memory
The spreading patterns in these tau transgenic mouse brains strongly suggest that propagation of tau in mouse brain follows the connectivity of neurons in the brain.
How tau can move from one neuron to another is not well understood.
Several recent findings started to explore the potential underlying mechanisms, including exosome release, synaptic release and other unconventional mechanisms of release as discussed in the following sections.

4.2.1.
Exosomes-Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles released by mammalian cells from intracellular multivesicular compartments.
They play important functions in intercellular communication, as exosomes are potential vehicles for delivering cellular contents from origin cells to recipient cells
Detection of tau in exosomes isolated from
Tau secretion in association with exosomes was first observed in HEK293 cells
However, other studies reported failures to detect tau in exosomes isolated from other cell lines
These contradictory studies were reexamined recently.
It was found that tau is present only in exosomes from mature (older than DIV14) but not immature neurons
Furthermore, only a minor fraction of secreted tau is actually associated with exosomes
Therefore, the sensitivity of the assay matters for the detection of exosomal tau
Using ultra-sensitive immunoassays specific for full-length and mid-region tau based on Simoa (named for single molecule array), the majority of free-floating tau secreted from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons was found to be mostly truncated
However, the ratio of fulllength to truncated tau is higher in exosomes than in free-floating fractions
A possible explanation is that exosomes are released from multivesicular bodies, where tau is captured for degradation by autophagy, before tau can be degraded.
Exosomal tau is phosphorylated (at T181 and possibly other sites) and oligomerized
Exosomes containing tau are capable of seeding tau aggregation in neighboring cells, including neurons and microglia
Interestingly, recent studies showed that microglia take up extracellular tau and promote tau propagation via exosome secretion, and knockout of nSMase2, a key regulator of exosome release, in vivo blocks exosome-mediated tau propagation
However, there is still a debate whether there is a significant difference in exosome-associated tau in CSF between AD patients and non-dementia controls
Thus, the functional contribution of exosomal tau to AD still needs more investigation.

Synaptic release-
Tau spread through neural networks may be due to a transsynaptic mechanism of release.
Phosphorylated soluble tau oligomers are enriched in synapses from AD brains and may propagate along neuronal connections
Intracerebral injections of tau seeds in P301S mice are associated with pathological spread via functionally connected neuroanatomical pathways: Injection into the entorhinal cortex leads to decreased synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region, while injection into the basal ganglia leads to motor deficits indicative of neurodegeneration
Tau derived from either AD, CBD or PSP patient brains that was injected into different brain regions spreads along neural networks independent of tau origin
Spread through the neural connectome may depend upon neuronal activity.
AMPA receptor activation stimulates release of tau in cultured neurons
Similarly, reverse microdialysis of K + into mouse brains increases tau secretion
Chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of neuronal activity increases tau release in primary neurons and is associated with brain hippocampus atrophy and tau pathology in P301 L mice
Seemingly in contradiction, stimulating neuronal activity in organotypic slices stimulates tau release in wild type but not 3xTg slices
However, basal tau release is increased in 3xTg organotypic slices compared to wild type.
It is unknown if whether increased secretion is due to higher network activity in the tau transgenic mice compared to wild type
It is possible that the 3xTg slices have enhanced network activity at baseline that could drive this increase in tau release.
In this case, the additional tau release induced by adding high KCl could be occluded in 3xTg slices.
In accordance with this idea, densely connected brain regions that have higher tau burden are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration in AD and progressive supranuclear palsy
In several early studies, tau was observed to associate with the plasma membrane
These studies indicate that tau may directly penetrate the membrane.
Two recent papers showed that tau is secreted directly through plasma membrane, occurring in specific membrane micro-domains and depending on some specific lipids like cholesterol and sphingomyelin
Both studies revealed that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) facilitate this unconventional tau secretion, likely by helping tau to be released from membranes at the end of the penetration process.
The role of HSPGs has been reported for unconventional secretion of other proteins
Importantly, tau phosphorylation and oligomerization is necessary for this secretion mechanism and these unconventionally secreted tau species can spread to adjacent cells and induce aggregation
These studies did not rule out other forms of secretion of free tau.
For example, a noncanonical secretion pathway mediated by Hsc70/DnaJ complex and SNAP-23 can also facilitate release of proteins into the extracellular space
Further investigations will help us understand the roles of these secretory pathways in tau spreading.
Just as the topological conundrum plagues the poorly-defined mechanisms of tau release, the same paradox applies for tau to cross the membrane and enter the cytosol of recipient cells.
If tau is secreted with exosomes, extracellular exosomes must somehow deliver tau seeds directly into the cytosol.
However, direct fusion of exosomes with the plasma membrane is yet to be reported.
Another potential mechanism for tau uptake into the cytosol is through direct translocation across the plasma membrane, which has recently been shown to mediate tau release
Again, no evidence directly supports this route in the literature so far.
Many studies consistently show that internalized tau proteins enter through endosomes and can remain in a low-pH compartment for a long time
Tau aggregates can also be internalized at axonal terminals and retrogradely transported toward the cell soma
An unbiased CRISPRi screen of 3200 genes further found that extracellular tau is taken up by micropinocytosis via the HSPG biosynthetic pathway
Tau uptake and tau fibril seeding ability can be blocked chemically by inhibiting binding to HSPGs using heparin, chlorate or heparinase, or genetically by knocking down genes encoding enzymes involved in HSPG synthesis in neuroglioma cells, iPSC-derived neurons and mouse brain slice cultures
Combining these studies, it seems that a two-step process is involved in tau entry, allowing for tau to act as a seed for aggregation in recipient cells: entering cells via a membranebased route followed by crossing the membrane boundary of these compartments and enter the cytosol in order to trigger aggregation.
Exactly how tau escapes from those membranes remains to be resolved.
Finally, further investigation should help clarify whether monomeric and aggregated tau species behave similarly in this entry process

Unconventional secretion-Other unconventional secretion pathways provide alternative avenues for non-vesicular tau release

Tau uptake-Mounting evidences demonstrate that tau can be taken up by neuronal cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis or micropinocytosis

4.2.5.
Seeding of aggregates by distinct strains-Tau is a highly soluble protein due to its flexible, hydrophilic composition.
In other terms, it may either adopt many conformations or no particular conformation at all.
Recent evidence suggests that pathogenic tau may form multiple, distinct structures
Two different strains with seeding ability that were isolated from the brains of P301S mice
Unique strains of tau that are associated with different tauopathies can be stably passaged in dividing cells, injected into mice, and then passaged back into cells, all while retaining the same unique conformation
Although different tau strains are associated with different pathologies in various cell types and brain regions [237], they seem not to have effect on the direction of tau propagation
There is tremendous variability in tau structure within each tauopathy, yet post-translational modifications and truncation have minimal effects on tau filament morphology
Instead, phosphorylation may be more critical in the early steps of dissociating tau from microtubules rather than directly causing aggregation.
Tau monoclonal antibodies are capable of distinguishing tau aggregates in AD brains from those in other tauopathies
One possible explanation for the selectivity of these antibodies is that there is an AD-specific tau strain.
Another possibility is that these antibodies only recognize AD-specific post-translational modifications that do not occur in other tauopathies.
Further study is required to determine if tau does acquire various morphologies and whether or not they are physiologically and pathologically relevant.

Role of glia and inflammation in tauopathy
Several pieces of data demonstrate the association between glia and tau pathology.
Activated glia cells were observed near neurons containing hyperphosphorylated tau in postmortem tauopathy brains
Clinically, an elevation of immune biomarkers such as soluble immune gene TREM2 and YKL-40 were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD and other tauopathy patients, and these increases are correlated with CSF tau and phospho-tau levels
In tau transgenic models, activated microglia and elevated inflammatory mediators in P301S tau models are associated with tau pathology
These early observations suggest that tau pathology may contribute to the activation of glia cells and the development of neuroinflammation in AD and other tauopathies
Genome-wide transcriptome studies in different tau transgenic models revealed that alterations in microglial phenotypes are driven by tau dysfunction: specifically, the inflammatory changes can be reversed by suppression of the tau transgene
Furthermore, transcriptome analysis of isolated microglia cells from tau transgenic mouse brains revealed an age-dependent neurodegeneration-specific molecular signature involving the interferon-related pathway and innate immune pathways in tau animal models
Recently, longitudinal gene expression changes were assessed in isolated microglia from tau transgenic animals, which revealed that NF-κB signaling and cytokinecytokine receptor interaction pathways may be the first to be activated in tau transgenic mouse brains, likely driven by the key upstream regulators
With the application of the new tools for single cell transcriptomics, mass cytometry and bioinformatic analyses
Lastly, how pathogenic tau activates microglia at the cellular and molecular level is unclear.
A recent study demonstrates that aggregated tau, following microglia uptake and lysosomal sorting, can activate the NLRP3-ASC inflammasome, an important sensor of innate immunity [259], providing some initial insight into the mechanism involved in this process.
The impact of glia activation and neuroinflammation on tau pathology is not fully understood.
Accumulating evidence suggests that these factors exacerbate tau pathology, likely through a non-cell autonomous impact on neuronal signaling via cytokine secretion
The complement pathway, a tau-associated molecular signature, seems to influence tau pathology too.
Inhibiting the complement C3ar pathway significantly reduces tau pathology in tauopathy animal models
A recent proteomics study identified that C1q protein accumulates in the postsynaptic density of P301S mice and AD patients, and mediates microglial-dependent synapse engulfment, adding another dimension to the contribution of microglia in tau pathology-triggered neurodegeneration
Finally, new topics such as the contribution of microglia senescence to the development of tau pathology during aging are emerging [270], providing us with more novel perspectives for the functions of microglia in tauopathies.
Overall, active research in this area will bring more clarity to the roles of glia and neuroinflammation on tauopathy [271].

New models for tau study: 3D culture and organoids
Developing technologies in 3D human neural cultures and cerebral organoids provide new systems for creating more relevant AD models.
Although these new AD model systems that develop Aβ plaques and tau pathology are still being characterized, one significant advantage of 3D cultures for studying tau pathology is that they dramatically increase the expression of 4R adult tau isoforms compared to 2D cultures, which mainly express 3R tau isoforms
A balanced expression of 3R and 4R isoforms is essential for recapitulating tauopathy from human brains.
Consequently, high levels of detergent-resistant, silverpositive aggregates of phosphorylated tau as well as filamentous tau are detectable in the soma and neurites of 3D-differentiated neuronal cells expressing fAD mutations [272], which have not been observed in either 2D cultures or animal models expressing human wild type tau
Additionally, 3D cultures can incorporate various human cell-types, including neurons, astrocytes and microglia
These improved 3D cell culture systems can be used to study intracellular tau aggregation and the consequences of tau modifications, as well as the function(s) of microglial on tau pathology
Therefore, the ability to form tau pathology in AD patient-derived 3D cultures provides an accessible cell culture platform that more closely resembles physiological conditions than 2D cultures do
3D cerebral organoids can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells and thus directly from AD patients
Brain organoids derived from fAD patients recapitulate Aβ aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation
They uniquely provide a platform for genetically manipulating human brain-like tissue and studying downstream effects such as tau phosphorylation state and tau spreading
Although organoids lack endogenous microglia, human iPSC-derived microglial-like cells can be implanted and integrated into brain organoids, where they are capable of phagocytosing brain-derived tau oligomers
It remains to be seen whether implanted induced microglia are capable of regulating existing tau pathology in organoids.
Therefore, with further characterization and development of these new models, we will be equipped with more powerful tools to understand the mechanism for tau pathogenesis in AD.

Therapeutic strategies and diagnostic tools centered on tau
Tau is emerging as a marker and therapeutic target for AD and other dementias.
Recent development of PET tracers targeting tau has allowed researchers to confirm in patients the spread of tau as characterized by
The tracers PBB3, flortaucipir (formally known as T807 and 18 F-AV-1451), THK-5351 and MK-6240 are capable of detecting tau
Using tau PET imaging, it was found that Aβ deposition precedes tau accumulation in fAD presenilin-1 (PSEN1) cases in a long-term study in a Colombian community containing cognitively unimpaired and impaired carriers of the PSEN1 E280 A mutation.
Elevated tau deposition in the neocortex was associated with mild cognitive impairment and worse scores on cognitive tests
It remains to be investigated whether this timeline holds in sporadic AD cases.
Importantly, this study demonstrates that tau PET imaging may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish individuals at high risk to develop the clinical symptoms of AD and to track disease progression.

Conclusion
Recent works have advanced scientists' understanding of the consequences of pathogenic tau.
Targeting pathways such as synaptic activity, inflammation, tau protein stability, or posttranslational modifications/modifiers of tau may provide valid therapeutic strategies.
En route toward that goal, the tauopathy field would benefit from exploring the elusive function(s) of tau other than its role in promoting microtubule-assembly.
A brief history of tau.
Tau protein is comprised of four primary domains, the N-terminal domain (blue), the proline-rich domain (tan), the microtubule-binding domain (pink), and the C-terminal region (green).
Alternative splicing of the N-terminal and microtubule-binding domains yields six isoforms in the CNS.
Repeat domains R1, R3 and R4 (light pink) are constitutive, while R2 (dark pink) is incorporated only in the three 4R isoforms.
N1 and/or N2 may be skipped, but inclusion of N2 requires that N1 also be included.
The final variants become: 0N3R, 1N3R, 2N3R, 0N4R, 1N4R, and 2N4R tau, the last of which is depicted here.
