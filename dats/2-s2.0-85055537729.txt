Licochalcone B, a chalcone derivative from Glycyrrhiza inflata, as a multifunctional agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
Licochalcone B (LCB), an extract from the root of Glycyrrhiza inflate, has the same caffeic acid scaffold as curcumin (Cur), which is known as an anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) agent.
However, there is no relevant research about anti-AD activity of LCB.
In this study, the anti-AD activity of LCB was investigated.
LCB could inhibit amyloid beta (Aβ 42 ) self-aggregation(IC 50 = 2.16±0.24
μM) and disaggregate pre-formed Aβ 42 fibrils, reduce metal-induced Aβ 42 aggregation through chelating metal ions.
Molecular docking further revealed that LCB inhibited Aβ 42 self-aggregation through forming two hydrogen bonds with Lys28 to block the salt bridge interaction at the C-terminus of Aβ 42 .
Anti-oxidant property of LCB was also observed by DCFH-DA assay.
In addition, LCB did show neuroprotective activity against H 2 O 2 -induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells.
In general, our results demonstrate that LCB, as a multifunctional agent, is likely to be promising therapeutics for AD.

Experimental

Materials
Licochalcone B (LCB, purity≥98.0%)
was purchased from Chengdu Mansite Biotech Co. Ltd.
Aβ 42, Thioflavin T, DCFH-DA, t-BuOOH, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), H 2 O 2 and MTT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Company, USA.
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were supplied by Invitrogen Gibco Co. (Grand Island, NY, USA).

Preparation of Aβ 42
Aβ 42 was dissolved to 4 mM in DMSO and stored at -80 °C.
The stock solution was diluted to certain concentrations with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h to get Aβ 42 fibrils.

ThT fluorescence assay
Experiments were performed by incubating the peptides in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 48 h (final Aβ 42 concentration -50 μM) with or without the tested compounds.
After incubation, all samples were diluted in 50 mM glycine-NaOH solution (pH=8.5)
containing Thioflavin T (5 μM).
Subsequently, after 5 min incubation with the dye, fluorescence signal was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 485 nm by a multifunctional microplate reader Tecan type (infinite M1000Pro).
The ThT assay was repeated in triplicate.

TEM imaging
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) assay was used to detect the inhibition effect of LCB on Aβ 42 fibrils formation.
10 µL and 25 µM aggregated Aβ 42 was mixed with or without equal amounts of 50 µM LCB, and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.
Following incubation, 5µL of duplicate samples were spotted onto 300-mesh copper grids for1min and the grids were washed with ultrapure water and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution for 1 min.
The staining solution was absorbed with filter paper.
The grids were then examined using TEM-1400 electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan)at 120 kV, with 100 nm scan bar.

Molecular docking
To study the interaction mode of LCB with Aβ 42 , a molecular docking study was performed using the CDOCKER program implemented in Discovery Studio 2.2.5.
The NMR structure of Aβ 42 (PDB code: 1IYT) was used here for docking studies.
Hydrogen atoms and charges were added to the systems using the CHARMm force field and the Momany-rone partial charge method.
The best scoring binding mode of LCB with Aβ 42 was selected.

Metal-chelating properties assay
The metal-chelating studies were carried out in ethanol using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi Company, Japan).
CuCl 2 , Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 , ZnCl 2 , and LCB were dissolved to 1 mM with ethanol.
A mixture of 20 μM LCB solution added with 20 μM CuCl 2 solution (Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 or ZnCl 2 ) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then recorded absorption spectra with wavelength ranging from 200-600 nm.

Metal-induced Aβ 42 aggregation assay
In this assay, the solution of Cu 2+ , Fe 3+ , and Zn 2+ were diluted in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (HEPES) buffer at pH 6.6 and 7.4, respectively.
LCB was dissolved in DMSO to 10 mM and then diluted with HEPES before use.
To study the effects of LCB on metal-induced Aβ 42 aggregation, experiments were performed by incubating 20 μM Aβ 42 with 40 μM Cu 2+ , Fe 3+ , and Zn 2+ in HEPES buffer at 37 °C for 45 min, with and without LCB.
After incubation, the samples were measured on a multifunctional microplate reader Tecan type (infinite M1000Pro) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 485 nm.

ROS detection in SH-SY5Y cells
In the experiment, SH-SY5Y cell line was used.
Cells were seeded on 96-wells plate and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum and 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO) for 24 h.
Then the cells were treated with LCB and Cur (as a positive control) at various concentrations for 24 h.
After incubation, all medium were removed from the wells, the cells were added 5 μM DCFH-DA in PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C.
Then the DCFH-DA was removed, the cells were incubated for another 30 min with 100 μM t-BuOOH in PBS.
At the end of incubation, the fluorescence intensities were measured with a multifunctional microplate reader Tecan type (infinite M1000Pro) at 488 nm excitation and 525 nm emission.
The percent inhibition on ROS generation was calculated by the following expression: ｛1 -(OD sample -OD blank) / (OD control -OD blank)｝× 100 %.

Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of LCB on SH-SY5Y cells was evaluated by using MTT assay.
Breifly, SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5×10 3 cells/well, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.
Then the cells were treated with various concentrations (1.5-12 μM) of LCB for 24 h.
Subsequently, 5 mg/mL MTT solution were added to each well and further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C.
After incubation, each well was treated with 100 μL DMSO to dissolve the purple formazan crystals.
The optical density of the wells was then read on the microplate reader at 570 nm.
The MTT assay was repeated in triplicate.

Neuroprotective effect against H 2 O 2 -induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells
To produce oxidative stress, H 2 O 2 was freshly prepared from a 30% stock solution prior to each experiment.
SH-SY5Y cells were plated in cell culture plates at a density of 5×10 3 cells per well.
In our study, SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with LCB for 24 h before being incubated with 400 μM H 2 O 2 for an additional 24 h.
The control group cells were treated with the same medium without H 2 O 2 or LCB.
The cell viability of SH-SY5Y cells was evaluated using MTT assay.
