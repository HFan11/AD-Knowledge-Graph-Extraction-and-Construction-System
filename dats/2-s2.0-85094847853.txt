Potential Drug Candidates to Treat TRPC6 Channel Deficiencies in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease and Brain Ischemia
Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia are among the many causative neurodegenerative diseases that lead to disabilities in the middle-aged and elderly population.
There are no effective disease-preventing therapies for these pathologies.
Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed the TRPC6 channel to be a promising molecular target for the development of neuroprotective agents.
TRPC6 channel is a non-selective cation plasma membrane channel that is permeable to Ca 2+ .
Its Ca 2+ -dependent pharmacological effect is associated with the stabilization and protection of excitatory synapses.
Downregulation as well as upregulation of TRPC6 channel functions have been observed in Alzheimer's disease and brain ischemia models.
Thus, in order to protect neurons from Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia, proper TRPC6 channels modulators have to be used.
TRPC6 channels modulators are an emerging research field.
New chemical structures modulating the activity of TRPC6 channels are being currently discovered.
The recent publication of the cryo-EM structure of TRPC6 channels should speed up the discovery process even more.
This review summarizes the currently available information about potential drug candidates that may be used as basic structures to develop selective, highly potent TRPC6 channel modulators to treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Due to increased life expectancies, neurodegenerative diseases (NDD), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia, and cerebrovascular diseases, are considered by WHO the main cause of disability in the coming decades.
Currently, there are no effective disease-modifying or preventing therapies for those NDDs.
AD is caused by the progressive loss of neurons in brain structures that are responsible for memory acquisition and preservation, such as the hippocampus and cortical areas.
The exact mechanism that causes neurons to die is not known.
Among the most studied toxic changes of proteins that cause neuronal degeneration in AD are extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) that forms neurofibrillary tangles.
Recently, disruption of immune system signaling in glial cells has started to receive growing attention due to the appearance of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for late-onset AD patients
Brain ischemia is a cerebrovascular disease that is caused by a restriction in blood supply, leading to oxygen deprivation and the rapid death of neurons.
Several mechanisms, including excitotoxicity, ionic imbalance, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and apoptosis, have been implicated in ischemic neuronal death
Acute brain ischemia can be treated successfully in modern healthcare settings, although treatment success depends on how quickly the patient receives medical care as well as the brain volume affected.
However, there are currently no effective treatment options for chronic brain ischemia, which is usually caused by cerebral atherosclerosis.
Although the pathophysiological mechanisms causing AD and cerebral ischemia may differ, cerebral ischemia serves as a risk factor for AD development
Such a common mechanism may be associated with Ca 2+ dyshomeostasis.
The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an important excitatory neurotransmitter receptor, has been reported as the key player in the Ca 2+ signaling in AD
However, the NMDA receptor blocker memantine only relieves the symptoms temporarily in the early to moderate stage of AD patients
Moreover, blocking NMDA receptors to prevent ischemic neuronal damage in clinical trials has caused severe adverse effects
Although multiple factors might have contributed to the unsuccessful clinical trials, it is possible that the disruption of neuroprotective pathways, which precedes NMDA receptors hyperactivation, could be responsible for either AD and/or ischemic brain damage.
One of such neuroprotective pathways is the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 6 (TRPC6)-dependent regulation of excitatory synapse formation.
TRPC6 overexpression has been shown to increase dendritic spine density
TRPC6 upregulates the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway that is important for dendritic growth
In addition, TRPC6 also acts as a negative regulator that suppresses NMDA-induced Ca 2+ influx in hippocampal neurons
TRPC6 overexpression has been observed in breast cancer cells
Overactivation of TRPC6 is toxic to immune cells (reviewed here
Gain-of-function mutations of TRPC6 have been associated with familial forms of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis
The mentioned studies indicate that despite the positive effect of TRPC6 activation in the brain, excessive TRPC6 activation has toxic effects on other cellular systems in the body.
Current prevalent evidence suggests that the TRPC6 channel function is downregulated in AD and cerebral ischemia
However, there are reports in the literature that observe TRPC6 overactivation in AD
Existing contradictions on TRPC6 channel function in AD and ischemia indicate that these NDDs might be heterogenic, meaning that in one group of patients, the disease leads to hypofunction of the TRPC6 channel; however, there is another group (most likely smaller than the first one) where TRPC6 is hyperactivated.
Thus, in order to preserve brain function, TRPC6 activity has to be in its physiological state, and deviations towards hypoactivity as well as hyperactivity are toxic to the cells.
In terms of patient treatment, a careful investigation of the dysfunction of the TRPC6-dependent molecular pathway has to be performed in order to develop appropriate pharmacological treatments for said pathologies.
This review is devoted to the description of the role of TRPC6 channels in AD and brain ischemia with a particular focus on the dysfunction of them as Ca 2+ -dependent channels.
Potential drug candidates that have shown their therapeutic effects in different cellular and animal models are discussed.
When available, the pros and cons of each particular TRPC6 channel modulator are mentioned.
TRPC6 is also involved in certain Ca 2+ -independent processes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) interaction
However, in order to keep the review focused, this Ca 2+ -independent process observed in AD and brain ischemia pathogenesis is omitted.

TRPC Channels and Their Regulation in Cells
Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels form a large family of multifunctional cell sensors.
There are 29 TRP channels that can be described and divided into six subfamilies based on sequence homology: seven canonical channels (TRPC), six vanilloid channels (TRPV), eight melastatin-related channels (TRPM), three polycystic channels (TRPP), three mucolipins (TPRML), and one ankyrin channel (TRPA)
TRPCs participate in different physiological processes in the development of the nervous system
TRPC subfamily consists of seven members: TRPC1, TRPC2, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7.
TRPC2 is a pseudogene in a number of vertebrates, including humans
Analysis of the expression of different types of TRPC channels in situ using the Allen Brain Atlas and of gene expression in different regions of the mouse brain has demonstrated that TRPC6 is highly expressed in the hippocampus
Western blot analysis of the rat hippocampus has shown that TRPC6 levels are enhanced in postsynaptic structures compared with synaptosomes.
Moreover, electron microscopy has shown that TRPC6 is mostly located in the postsynaptic sites
TRPs are cloned and identified, assuming that they are calcium-selective and activated by the emptying of internal Ca 2+ stores (store-operated channels (SOC))
After their initial functional characterization, it has turned out that both assumptions do not hold true, especially for TRPCs
These ion channels only show a moderate Ca 2+ selectivity (PCa/PNa from ~0.5 to 9), and the TRPC3/6/7 subfamily of TRPC channels can be activated by the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) produced by receptor-activated phospholipase C (PLC) without any involvement of internal stores (receptor-operated channels (ROC))
Store-operated Ca 2+ entry (SOCE) via TRPCs happens when 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or some other intracellular mechanism empties Ca 2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
The fall in the ER Ca 2+ concentration signals to the plasma membrane to open store-operated channels
The major breakthrough in the understanding of SOCE physiology happened when Ca 2+ -sensing stromal interaction molecule (STIM) ER proteins and plasma membrane (PM) Orai 1-3 channels have been described
STIM1 and 2 proteins reside in the ER and monitor ER Ca 2+ concentration with their EF-hand motif.
When the ER Ca 2+ concentration drops, Ca 2+ dissociates from EF-hand, thus allowing STIM proteins to oligomerize and move to ER-PM tight junctions where they interact with PM Orai and TRP channels in order to facilitate Ca 2+ flow.

Role of TRPC6 in the Formation of Excitatory Synapses
TRPC6 plays a certain physiological role in the formation of excitatory synapses.
Particularly, TRPC6 overexpression increases dendritic spine density
At the same time, overexpression of TRPC1, TRPC3-5, and TRPC7 does not affect spine morphology
Meanwhile, the downregulation of TRPC6 expression leads to spine density reduction, lowers the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs)
Activation of TRPC6 can promote spine formation via the STIM2-neuronal SOCE-CaMKII pathway.
The expression level of STIM2 is downregulated in hippocampal neurons from PS1-M146V-KI
The STIM2 reduction may be a compensatory response to ER Ca 2+ overload in these models and may lead to the loss of mushroom spines in PS1-M146V-KI and APP-KI hippocampal neurons.
TRPC6 and Orai2 channels are suggested to be the key components of neuronal SOCE in hippocampal cells
It is hypothesized that the downstream molecule for TRPC6-mediated SOCE in hippocampal neurons is CaMKII since upregulation of neuronal SOCE activity recovers phosphorylation of CaMKII, restores the number of mushroom spines in hippocampal neurons in mouse models of AD
Alternative TRPC6-downstream signaling pathways are the Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) pathway and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway, which is important for dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons
TRPC6 also acts as a negative regulator that suppresses NMDA-induced Ca 2+ influx in hippocampal neurons
In addition, NMDAR has been shown to regulate transcription and degradation of TRPC6 in neurons in a bidirectional manner through NMDAR subunit 2A (NR2A) or NR2B activation

Hypo-and Hyperactivation of TRPC6 Channels in Different Pathogenetic Forms of AD
There is evidence that different genetically inherited familial forms of AD (fAD) can cause TRPC6 dysfunction
Both hypo-
fAD-associated PS2-N141I, M239V mutations cause downregulation of TRPC6-mediated Ca 2+ entry in transiently transfected HEK cells.
Lessard et al. suggested that TRPC6 downregulation by PS2-N141I, M239V does not depend on ER Ca 2+ content but rather involves the interaction of PS2 with an intermediate protein of unknown origin
Later on, contradictory results were obtained on ER Ca 2+ content in PS2-N141I expressing cells
In double knockout fibroblasts, PS2-N141I increases ER Ca 2+ content
According to the classical understanding of the SOCE physiology, overloaded ER Ca 2+ stores downregulate SOCE
PS1-M146V is an fAD-associated mutation that has been reported to downregulate TRPC6-dependent Ca 2+ entry in hippocampal neurons in store-operated mode
PS1-M146V has been shown to increase ER Ca 2+ content in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
It has been demonstrated in previous studies
Furthermore, it has been discovered that overloaded ER Ca 2+ stores cause compensatory downregulation of TRPC6 channels in PS1-M146V neurons
A similar impact on TRPC6 function has been reported for fAD-associated mutations in APP (KM670/671NL and I716F)
There are fAD mutations in PSEN1 (PSEN1M146L, PSEN1S170F, PSEN1I213F, PSEN1E318G, PSEN1P117R, PSEN1L226F, PSENA246E)
TRPC6 activators have been shown to recover the percentage of mushroom spines in cell culture models of fAD and induce long-term potentiation in hippocampal brain slices taken from AD mouse models
Based on these results, it is suggested that activators of TRPC6 may have a therapeutic value for the treatment of fAD with TRPC6 hypofunction
PS1-∆E9 mutation has been reported to empty ER Ca 2+ stores
There are other fAD mutations in PSEN1 (PSEN1D257A, PSEN1D385A), which have been reported to enhance SOCE
Today, there is only one fAD-associated PS1-∆E9 mutation that has been shown to upregulate the TRPC6 function in store-operated mode
A TRPC6 inhibitor has been shown to recover mushroom spine percentage in a cell culture model of fAD
Inhibitors of TRPC6 have been proposed to have therapeutic effects in fAD with TRPC6 hyperfunction
To conclude the section, in order to normalize TRPC6 function in neurons and preserve the stability of excitatory synaptic contacts, suitable pharmacological agents have to be used for distinct genetic forms of AD.

Cerebral Ischemia as a Risk Factor for AD Development
Recent experimental and clinical findings have demonstrated a high degree of correlation between cerebral ischemia and AD
While some studies have indicated that ischemic stroke significantly increases the risk of AD
Previous studies have suggested that almost 30% of AD subjects bear evidence of cerebral infarction at autopsy
A meta-analysis that comprises seven cohort studies and two nested case-control studies has found that a history of stroke is associated with the development of AD
Notably, several lines of evidence suggest that AD patients have a high risk of cerebral ischemia
For example, among AD patients with no history of previous stroke, vascular dementia, or other cerebral degenerative diseases, the incidence of ischemic stroke amounts to 37.8 per 1000 persons (versus 23.2 in non-AD controls)
In another register-based matched cohort study
When the results are analyzed within different age groups, the risk of ischemic stroke is found to be increased among AD patients younger than 80 years

Role of TRPC6 in the Development of Ischemia
Ca 2+ overload is one of the main molecular mechanisms involved in ischemic cell damage and death
TRPC6, along with a few other prominent members of the family, has recently gained considerable attention as a promising target for the prevention of Ca 2+ overload
Dysregulation of TRPC6 activity has been implicated in ischemic stroke
On the one hand, upregulation and maintenance of TRPC6 activity prevent NMDAR hyperactivation and the subsequent Ca 2+ influx, development of excitotoxicity, and neuronal death.
In supporting this notion, both direct activation by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (a synthetic analog of diacylglycerol, the main endogenous TRPC6 agonist) and overexpression of TRPC6 inhibit NMDA-induced currents in cultured hippocampal neurons
Trpc6-transgenic mice with an elevated basal level of TRPC6 expression are less susceptible to cerebral ischemia than their wild-type littermates and have lower mortality rates, reduced infarct volumes, and better neurological outcomes after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Recent studies have shown that TRPC6-mediated signaling promotes neuronal survival
In addition, positive modulation of TRPC6 activity allows for the sustained activation of the CREB/CaMK-IV and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways, which is vital for neuronal development, survival, and proper functioning
Blocking CREB signaling hinders post-stroke recovery
In turn, elevated CREB and CaMK-IV activity is associated with improved post-stroke outcomes in a number of animal studies
On the other hand, some experimental data suggest that the upregulation of TRPC6 activity increases intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations concomitantly with NMDAR activation, further exacerbating excitotoxic damage to neurons
Oxygen-glucose deprivation in cultured cortical neurons and MCAO in wild-type mice are associated with elevated TRPC6 expression and activity, while TRPC6 deletion attenuates glutamate-and NMDA-induced cytotoxicity and reduced infarct volumes
Knockdown of TRPC3, 6, and 7 prevents apoptosis in cultured astrocytes and ameliorates ischemic brain injury in mice
Moreover, prevention of TRPC6 hyperactivation results in increased neuronal viability, reduced infarct volumes and brain edema, and improved functional recovery following acute ischemic stroke in rats
Other TRPC6 inhibitors have also been reported to exert beneficial effects in experimental models to some extent relevant to ischemic brain injury (e.g., acute renal ischemia/reperfusion injury)
Existing controversies regarding the TRPC6 function in the development of brain ischemia might be due to different experimental settings (i.e., rodent model, sex, age, the method used to model ischemia).
However, similarly to AD, brain ischemia seems to be heterogenic, meaning that one group of patients has TRPC6 hypofunction, and another one has TRPC6 hyperfunction.
This indicates the need to develop pathology-dependent strategies to treat different NDD patients.

Available Drug Candidates to Modulate TRPC6 Activity
To date, two strategies have been proposed for the pharmacological modulation of TRPC6 activity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia: (1) TRPC6 activation to allow Ca 2+ influx via neuronal SOCE and sustain the stability of postsynaptic contacts (for AD) and to attenuate NMDAR activity and prevent calcium-dependent excitotoxicity
Although apparently mutually exclusive, both of these strategies are aimed to keep the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration within the normal range, which requires limiting its entry via transmembrane channels and/or release from intracellular stores
Given the pivotal role of NMDAR in excitotoxic neuronal damage, NMDAR blockers have been proposed as potential neuroprotective agents, although most of them have failed to show substantial effectiveness in human patients so far
Due to that fact, TRPC6 has emerged as an alternative therapeutic target for AD and ischemic stroke

TRPC6 Activators
TRPC6 activation can be induced by several endogenous diacylglycerols (DAGs)
A number of DAG analogs, including 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, DAG-containing arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids
This channel can also be activated by agents of synthetic or natural origin that are structurally different from DAG. Direct TRPC6 agonists acting in receptor-operated mode include synthetic compounds, such as flufenamic acid
The benzimidazole-based small molecule agonist GSK1702934A, its azobenzene derivative OptoBI-1
In contrast, certain naturally occurring chemicals are known to potentiate TRPC6 effects in an indirect manner.
These include the stilbenoid resveratrol
Recently, a novel potent ethanolamine derivative, bis-{2-[(2E)-4-hydroxy-4-oxobut-2-enoyloxy]-N,N-diethylethanaminium} butandioate (FDES), has been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects due to selective TRPC6 channel activation in store-operated mode
The aminoquinazoline derivative, NSN21778, was demonstrated by Zhang et al. to have a store-dependent mechanism of action where DAG is required as a co-factor for TRPC6 activation
The piperazine derivative, 51164, has been shown to activate TRPC6 in store-operated mode requiring DAG as a co-factor

Endogenous Ligands and Analogs

DAG
A compound containing both DAG and arachidonic acid fragments, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonylsn-glycerol (SAG), elicits a rapid Ca 2+ flux into HEK293 cells, while 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoylsn-glycerol (SDG), which does not contain an arachidonic acid moiety, has significantly lower potency
1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a diacylglycerol analog and a TRPC3/6/7 channel modulator, is found to cross the plasma membrane and intracellularly activate the channels
OAG has been shown to activate Ca 2+ -permeable channels, displaying TRPC6-like properties in cultured cortical neurons
In addition, OAG has been demonstrated to increase field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) levels in a TRPC-dependent manner in hippocampal slices from wild-type mice
However, as far as we are aware, those compounds have not yet been evaluated in in vivo models of AD and cerebral ischemia.

Lysophosphatidylcholine
Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is produced from phosphatidylcholines via partial hydrolysis generally catalyzed by phospholipase A2.
Increased LPC production has been observed in various disorders of the central nervous system, including stroke and AD
Results of a cohort study have suggested that LPC levels could be used as a tool for ischemic stroke risk stratification in patients who have suffered a transitory ischemic attack before
LPC is shown to activate TRPC6 channels and promote Ca 2+ flux into endothelial cells, hampering their migration and preventing endothelial healing, thus contributing to atherogenesis
20-Hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-Eicosatetraenoic Acid 20-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) is the main eicosanoid metabolite of arachidonic acid and a potent inflammatory vasoconstrictor.
In HEK293 cells, 20-HETE (half maximal effective concentration, EC 50 of 0.8 µM) elicits a three-fold increase in TRPC6 activity (as indicated by an increased inward, the non-selective current observed in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings) but does not affect intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations
In isolated guinea pig airway smooth muscle cells, it induces a dose-dependent inotropic effect via TRPC6 activation and the subsequent promotion of Ca 2+ entry
Nevertheless, 20-HETE has been shown to have detrimental effects in ischemic and traumatic brain injury, which might be explained by its vasoconstrictor properties, and has even been proposed as a predictor of poor prognosis in stroke patients [100].
To our knowledge, 20-HETE has not yet been tested in AD models, but it has been shown to activate TRPV1 channels in dorsal root ganglia cultures [101].
10R,17R-Dihydroxydocosa-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-Hexaenoic Acid 10R,17R-dihydroxydocosa-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid (Neuroprotectin D1, NPD1, Table
NPD1, among other neuroprotectins, is synthesized in ischemic brain tissue as a result of DHA enzymatic lipoxygenation.
In a rat model of ischemic stroke, NPD1 administration is associated with a significantly elevated TRPC6 and CREB activity, while the inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway results in a decrease in NPD1 neuroprotective activity.
Continuous intracerebroventricular administration of NPD1 over 10 min at 2 h after reperfusion sustains TRPC6/CREB activity, reduces infarct volumes, and promotes functional recovery
The role of NPD1 in TRPC6-mediated neuroprotection in AD has not been described yet.
PSEN1∆E9-hyperexpressing primary hippocampal neurons Co-incubation for 16 h reduced TRPC6-dependent neuronal SOCE in postsynaptic spines increased mushroom spines percentages
Hyperforin and Other Phytochemicals Hyperforin ((1R,5S,6R,7S)-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,3,7-tris(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-6-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)-5-(2-methylpropanoyl)bicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene-2,9-dione)
(Hyperforin, Table
Hyperforin is a potent inhibitor of TRPC6 proteolysis and a positive modulator of TRPC6/CREB activity, acting in a manner similar to that of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
It is thought to bind to TRPC6 due to structural similarities to DAG and has higher selectivity because of the relative rigidity of the phloroglucinol pharmacophore moiety
Neuroprotective and antidepressant-like properties of hyperforin and hyperforin-containing H. perforatum preparations involve the modulation of axonal growth, neurite growth and branching, dendritic spine formation, and the promotion of neuronal plasticity
As proposed by Singer et al., the increase in Na + concentration resulting from TRPC6 activation by hyperforin might inhibit serotonin reuptake via the serotonin/Na + symporter, which, together with increased synaptic plasticity, could explain the antidepressant-like activity of H. perforatum-based drugs
Confirming this hypothesis, larixyl acetate, a selective blocker of TRPC6, abolishes the antidepressant-like effects of hyperforin observed in mice in the tail suspension test
In an ex vivo experiment, hyperforin (0.3 µM) promotes mature stubby spine formation and decreases the proportion of immature thin spine formation in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons but does not affect mushroom spine density and morphology.
Proper TRPC6 expression level and the presence of a fully functional TRPC6 channel are required for hyperforin to exert its effects, which suggests the key role of TRPC6 activation in its mechanism of action
Using different rodent models of ischemic stroke, hyperforin has been shown to promote post-stroke neuro-and angiogenesis [103,109], inhibit microglial activation [108], attenuate brain edema [104], stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis, ameliorate post-stroke depression and anxiety, and restore memory function
Chronic hyperforin treatment stimulates the expression of the tropomyosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) BDNF receptors as well as of TRPC6 in murine cortical neurons but has no effect on hippocampal neurogenesis
When applied intracerebroventricularly to rats immediately after MCAO, hyperforin preserves TRPC6 activity, reduces infarct volumes, promotes functional recovery, and increases neurologic scores at 24 h after reperfusion
There is a lot of evidence that hyperforin and its derivatives are highly selective towards the TRPC6 channel and do not exert similar effects on its closest relative, the TRPC3 channel
Several studies have shown that hyperforin activates TRPC6 and increases its expression
The neuroprotective effect of hyperforin has been demonstrated in several rodent models of AD.
In rats co-injected with amyloid fibrils and hyperforin in the hippocampus, hyperforin reduces amyloid deposit formation and, therefore, decreases the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, reactive oxidative species formation, and attenuated behavioral impairments
A more stable hyperforin derivative, tetrahydrohyperforin, also prevents the cognitive decline and synaptic impairment in double transgenic APPswe/PSEN1∆E9 mice in a dose-dependent manner.
It has been shown that the neuroprotective mechanism of tetrahydrohyperforin is associated with a reduced rate of proteolytic processing of APP, decreased the total amount of fibrillar and oligomeric forms of Aβ, reduced level of tau hyperphosphorylation, and attenuated astrogliosis
Tetrahydrohyperforin has been shown to specifically target TRPC6
Hyperforin is also thought to be responsible for the induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 by binding to and activating the pregnane X receptor
Moreover, hyperforin is difficult to synthetize [135], unstable when exposed to light, and irritant to the gastrointestinal tract
Such side effects might limit the use of hyperforin as a TRPC6 activator.

Resveratrol
Resveratrol (5-[(E)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]benzene-1,3-diol) (Table
In the pioneering study of
Injected intraperitoneally either during or shortly after the induction of cerebral ischemia, it largely prevents delayed neuronal cell death and glial cell activation in a gerbil model of transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion
Based on the observed increase in TRPC6 and CREB activity, which has been prevented by PD98059 or KN62, inhibitors of MEK and CAMKIV/ CaMKII, respectively, it is suggested that resveratrol has exerted its effects via TRPC6 activation.
Since its administration has been accompanied by a marked decrease in calpain activity, resveratrol is classified as an indirect positive modulator of TRPC6 activity
When given to rats for 7 days before MCAO, resveratrol significantly reduces infarct volumes and enhances neurological scores at 24 h after reperfusion
Low-dose oral resveratrol treatment for three consecutive days before and after an ischemic stroke induced in rats by middle cerebral artery clipping alleviates brain damage caused by the following recurrent stroke.
Resveratrol normalizes BBB function and reduces cerebral edema without affecting regional cerebral blood flow and systemic blood pressure
Resveratrol preconditioning (48 h before the induction of ischemia) effectively prevents neuronal cell loss in a mouse MCAO model of stroke
In a rat model of global cerebral ischemia induced by asphyxial cardiac arrest, resveratrol (48 h before the induction of ischemia) is shown to protect the CA1 region of the hippocampus similarly to ischemic preconditioning
Resveratrol is actively used in AD research
Neuroprotective effects of resveratrol have been shown to be associated with the activation of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) and vitagenes production
In a phase II trial in AD patients, resveratrol is safe and well-tolerated, but its effectiveness is contradictory
Although generally considered as a non-toxic therapeutic agent, high doses of resveratrol inhibit CYP3A4 activity in vitro

Synthetic Compounds Flufenamic Acid
Flufenamic
FFA has been found to selectively activate TRPC6, at the same time, inhibiting TRPC3, 4, 5, and 7
Direct activation of TRPC6 by FFA has been confirmed in a number of in vitro studies
Male (but not female) embryonic mice cortical neurons, which have been pre-treated with FFA 15 min before oxygen-glucose deprivation, have shown significantly higher viability, although this effect is not linked by the authors to TRPC6 activation
Similar results are obtained in a recent in vitro glutamate toxicity assay using isolated rat embryonic hippocampal neurons
Multiple experimental evidences suggest that FFA is a broad spectrum ion channel modulator, with a preference for non-selective cation channels and chloride channels (reviewed here
Its activity seems to be dose-dependent since FFA inhibits TRPC6 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 17.1 µM [151] but activates the same channel at 100 µM [148].
TRPM8 is inhibited by 100 µM FFA but is slightly activated at higher concentrations
A worse situation is reported for big calcium-activated potassium channels (BK Ca) modulation since FFA activates the channel below 10 µM, inhibits the channel between 10 to 50 µM, and then activates the channel above 50 µM
Such opposing effects on the same channels and a huge number of other ion channels that are modulated by FFA makes it an inappropriate drug for usage in humans.

Piperazines

Sawamura et al.
discovered a group of piperazine-based potent TRPC3/6/7 agonists functioning in receptor-operated mode with varying selectivity for different channel subtypes
Among that group, 2-[4-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-N-(2-ethoxyphenyl)acetamide (PPZ2, Table
PPZ2 and PPZ1 ([4-(5-chloro-2methylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-3-fluorophenylmethanone) (Table
Later on, another piperazine derivative, N-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)acetamide (51164, Table
Nanomolar concentrations of 51164 protect mushroom spines from amyloid toxicity, induce TRPC6-dependent neuronal SOCE in postsynaptic spines, and restore the induction of long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices taken from 6 months old 5xFAD mice
AZP2006), another piperazine derivative, attenuates Aβ and tau toxicity and improves cognitive performance in various mouse models
Currently, AZP2006 is in phase 2 clinical trial in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy
Piperazine derivatives as the majority of TRPC6 agonists cross-react with TRPC3 and TRPC7
Among other side effects of piperazines is their hepatotoxicity [137]; however, hepatotoxicity has not been predicted by bioinformatical analyses for a 51164 compound
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and multiple organ failure have been predicted by bioinformatical analyses; thus, there is a need to search for the lowest therapeutic dose for the 51164 compound, and most likely, there is a need to modify its structure in order to minimize the mentioned side effects
Bis-{2-[(2E)-4-Hydroxy-4-Oxobut-2-Enoyloxy]-N,N-Diethylethanaminium} Butandioate Bis-{2-[(2E)-4-hydroxy-4-oxobut-2-enoyloxy]-N,N-diethylethanaminium} butandioate (Table
Chronic FDES administration decreases mortality and improves motor function and coordination following permanent bilateral common carotid artery ligation [120] and reduces spatial memory deficit following middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/reperfusion
Later, FDES was demonstrated to ameliorate fore-and hindlimb motor disturbances and increase overall locomotor activity in rats with unilateral traumatic brain injury
FDES is shown to potentiate neuronal SOCE into postsynaptic spines in mouse hippocampal neurons
Since TRPC6 knockdown abolishes the effects of FDES on neuronal SOCE (similarly to hyperforin), TRPC6 activation is suggested to be the primary mechanism of FDES neuroprotective action.
Nanomolar concentrations of FDES effectively protect mushroom dendritic spines from amyloid synaptotoxicity, stabilizing and enhancing synaptic transmission, and preserving synaptic contact density
Similarly to hyperforin, FDES decreases the proportion of immature thin and stubby spines in hippocampal neurons.
When administered intraperitoneally to rats subjected to MCAO for 7 consecutive days starting from 1 h after reperfusion, FDES improves short-term spatial memory retention, as observed in the Barnes maze
FDES is a precursor of choline and has been shown to have nootropic and actoprotective properties
We assume that FDES would cross-react with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, causing phospholipase C activation and production of IP3 and DAG.
This cross-reactivity of FDES could further enhance its TRPC6-agonistic properties, although this hypothesis remains to be experimentally proven.
N-[4-[2-[(6-Aminoquinazolin-4-yl)Amino]ethyl]phenyl]acetamide N-[4-[2-[(6-aminoquinazolin-4-yl)amino]ethyl]phenyl]acetamide (NSN21778, Table
Despite its effectiveness in terms of improving mushroom spine morphology and TRPC6-mediated SOCE in PS1-KI and APP-KI hippocampal neurons and rescuing long-term potentiation in the APP-KI mouse model of AD, NSN21778 is found to have a rather poor pharmacokinetic profile and a low penetration of the blood-brain barrier

Other TRPC6 Agonists
Several compounds described below have been confirmed to activate the TRPC6 channel using in vitro assays.
However, to the best of our knowledge, their specific neuroprotective properties remain unexplored.
Given their ability to interact with TRPC6, these compounds can be considered as potential neuroprotective agents.

Pyrazolopyrimidines
A number of pyrazolopyrimidines obtained by Qu et al. are reported to be direct agonists of TRPC6, 3, and 7.
Among the four pyrazolopyrimidines tested by Qu et al., ethyl 4-(7-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (compound 4n) is most active towards TRPC6 (EC 50 = 1.39 or 0.89 µM depending on the conditions).
However, compound 4n has demonstrated a much higher affinity for TRPC3 and TRPC7 (EC 50 = 0.019 and 0.090 µM, respectively)
(EC 50 = 0.08 and 0.44 µM, respectively), acting directly and independent of protein lipase C signaling from the extracellular side [157].
OptoBI-1, an azobenzene moiety-containing photochromic derivative of GSK1702934A, is found to activate TRPC6 as well as TRPC3 and 7, although having a slightly higher affinity for TRPC3.
Light treatment of cultured murine hippocampal neurons with OptoBI-1 suppresses action potential firing elicited by repetitive depolarizing current injections
3-(6,7-Dimethoxy-3,3-Dimethyl-3,4-Dihydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-2H-Chromen-2-One Recently, a novel small-molecule allosteric TRPC6 agent, 3-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,3-dimethyl-3,4dihydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-2H-chromen-2-one (C20), has been reported by Häfner et al.
C20 (EC 50 = 2.37 µM) selectively activates TRPC6 channels in several HEK cell lines while only slightly reducing the basal activity of TRPC3 and increasing that of TRPC7 and not affecting TRPC4 and 5 activity at all.
Higher concentrations of C20 (10 µM) potentiate the efficacy of OAG and GSK1702934A, low-selective TRPC6 agonists described above, in HEK cells and freshly prepared human platelets
It can be assumed that the mechanism of action of C20 involves TRPC6 sensitization and not with its activation per se; that is, C20 allows TRPC6 to be activated at a low basal concentration of DAG

TRPC6 Inhibitors
AD seems to be a multifactorial disease with different pathogenic cascades occurring in different patients.
In terms of TRPC6 channel dysfunction, there are forms of fAD, which demonstrate TRPC6 hyperfunction
For those patients, TRPC6 inhibitors might be used in order to normalize intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis.
The pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia is not fully understood.
Similarly to AD, cerebral ischemia involves several different pathological cascades.
There are studies reporting that TRPC6-mediated Ca 2+ and Na+ influx facilitates NMDAR activation and exacerbates excitotoxicity, while TRPC6 deletion attenuates neuronal damage and death following focal cerebral ischemia
In such cases, where excessive TRPC6 activity seems to be present, the use of TRPC6 inhibitors might be beneficial.
Arachidonic acid, which is released following cerebral ischemia, can be metabolized to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE).
20-HETE is a potent vasoconstrictor that may contribute to ischemic injury
Synthetic 20-HETE has been shown to activate TRPC6
Thus, inhibition of 20-HETE production by HET0016 reduces TRPC6 activation
Inhibition of 20-HETE synthesis by N-hydroxy-N'-(4-n-butyl-2-methylphenyl)formamidine (HET0016, Table
In neonatal piglets subjected to 6 min of acute asphyxia, HET0016 potentiates the neuroprotective effects of delayed hypothermia, increasing neuronal viability, preventing seizure development, and reducing neurological deficit
Another 20-HETE inhibitor known as N-(3-chloro-4-morpholin-4-yl)phenyl-N -hydroxyimidoformamide (TS-011, Table
We are unaware of any direct investigations of neuroprotective effects of HET0016 and TS-011 (Table
However, since patients with Alzheimer's disease show an accumulation of (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) adducts [159], and HET0016 is a potent inhibitor of ωand ω-1-hydroxylation of HNE/HNA (4-hydroxynonanoic acid) [160], HET0016 could be of interest regarding its potential neuroprotective properties in AD.
In mice with closed-head traumatic brain injury, larixyl acetate, a naturally occurring diterpene, ameliorates endothelial dysfunction
In isolated mouse lungs, larixyl acetate prevents the development of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response
TRPC6 inhibition is now considered to be the primary mechanism of larixyl's neuroprotective action
Hou et al. found that TRPC6 knockout or inhibition by SAR7334 mitigates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells, which is considered to play a major role in renal ischemia/reperfusion
SAR7334 and the tryptoline derivative 8009-5364 are reported to diminish acute hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary arterial pressure in isolated mouse lungs
SAR7334 has no effect on SOCE in primary cortical neurons
Some rare-earth metal ions, including La3+ and Gd3+, have been shown to inhibit TRPC6 activity
But since those ions inhibit all channels of the TRP family (except TRPM2), they cannot be used as selective TRPC6 antagonists.
Clotrimazole (1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-imidazole) is an imidazole compound, which inhibits TRPM2, TRPM3, TRPV4, and TRPC6 channels
In SOCE mechanism studies, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB)
2-APB blocks TRPC6 [163] and was later found to impact Orai channel functioning [164].
2-APB has also been shown to block Ca 2+ influx induced by acetylcholine or thapsigargin application but not by DAG
SKF-96365 is considered to be an inhibitor of receptor-and store-operated elevation of intracellular calcium levels via entry through voltage-independent channels
Studies have demonstrated successful blocking of TRPC6 using SKF-96365 (IC 50 = 2 µM), but a less pronounced effect on TRPC3 is also observed (IC 50 = 12 µM)
8009-5364 is another highly specific TRPC6 antagonist, which has an IC 50 of 3.2 µM, and is considered a promising agent for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension
Investigation of neuronal SOCE mechanism in striatal neurons has revealed 4-N-[2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethyl]quinazoline-4,6-diamine (EVP4593, Table
EVP4593 has also been found to target heteromeric but not homomeric TRCP1 channels
Later on, EVP4593 was demonstrated to block Orai channels at 300 nM concentration
In cultured hippocampal neurons exhibiting PSEN1∆E9 mutation, TRPC6 hyperactivation is blocked by 30 nM EVP4593
EVP4593 has been shown to inhibit the nuclear factor kappa-b (NF-Kb)
It has been also observed that NF-Kb downregulates TRPC6 protein expression
Whether this increase in TRPC6 protein expression would compete with EVP4593-mediated blockade of TRPC6-dependent SOCE is an open question.

Conclusions
The present review summarizes current knowledge on the role of TRPC6 channels in the development of two neurological disorders: Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia.
Cerebral ischemia serves as a risk factor for AD, and vice versa.
It is becoming evident that both diseases can be caused by either upregulation or downregulation of TRPC6 channels.
Thus, understanding the nature of the disruption of this molecular pathway in each particular patient is extremely important for appropriate drug prescription.
TRPC6 is structurally similar to TRPC3 and 7, and therefore the majority of compounds do not act selectively on either of these three isoforms, making it difficult to develop selective TRPC6 pharmacological modulators.
Moreover, a number of TRPC6 channel modulators are cross-reactive to other cellular targets, thus limiting their pharmacological potential.
Toxicity profiles of some known TRPC6 modulators (such as FFA) require further structural optimization.
The presence of a wide range of different chemical substances that are known to interact with TRPC6 channels as well as the availability of cryo-electron microscopy structures of TRPC6 and 3 [169] may allow determining the pharmacophore in order to design selective TRPC6 activators and inhibitors in the future.
In turn, the development of selective TRPC6 channel modulators could help slow down the progression of AD, cerebral ischemia, and, most likely, other TRPC6-dependent diseases.
