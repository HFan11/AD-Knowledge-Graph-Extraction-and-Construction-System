Perinuclear Lamin A and Nucleoplasmic Lamin B2 Characterize Two Types of Hippocampal Neurons through Alzheimer’s Disease Progression
Background.
Recent reports point to a nuclear origin of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Aged postmitotic neurons try to repair their damaged DNA by entering the cell cycle.
This aberrant cell cycle re-entry involves chromatin modifications where nuclear Tau and the nuclear lamin are involved.
The purpose of this work was to elucidate their participation in the nuclear pathological transformation of neurons at early AD.
Methodology.
The study was performed in hippocampal paraffin embedded sections of adult, senile, and AD brains at I-VI Braak stages.
We analyzed phospho-Tau, lamins A, B1, B2, and C, nucleophosmin (B23) and the epigenetic marker H4K20me3 by immunohistochemistry. Results.
Two neuronal populations were found across AD stages, one is characterized by a significant increase of Lamin A expression, reinforced perinuclear Lamin B2, elevated expression of H4K20me3 and nuclear Tau loss, while neurons with nucleoplasmic Lamin B2 constitute a second population.
Conclusions.
The abnormal cell cycle reentry in early AD implies a fundamental neuronal transformation.
This implies the reorganization of the nucleo-cytoskeleton through the expression of the highly regulated Lamin A, heterochromatin repression and building of toxic neuronal tangles.
This work demonstrates that nuclear Tau and lamin modifications in hippocampal neurons are crucial events in age-related neurodegeneration.

Introduction
The nuclear lamin (NL) is a structural framework of four intermediate filaments type V composed by a peripheral nuclear lamina and a diffuse internal network
Two lamin subtypes, A and B, each of them with different physicochemical properties and cell type-specific expression levels, are their main components
The human gene that codifies the Lamin A subtype, LMNA, displays alternative splicing giving rise to the isoforms Lamin A and Lamin C, while two different genes LMNB1 and LMNB2 codify for Lamin B1 and B2, respectively
From its location adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane, NL extends through the nucleoplasm regulating chromatin dynamics and providing nuclear structural scaffolding
The complex relationship between NL and chromatin specializes in the modulation and maintenance of euchromatin and heterochromatin domains or chromosomic territories.
It regulates DNA and RNA synthesis by building a replication and transcription scaffold, and it orchestrates the DNA damage response, safeguarding genome stability
More than 40% heterochromatin is associated with the nuclear periphery, forming the lamin-associated chromatin domains (LADs) and to the nucleolar periphery, defined as the nucleolus associated domains (NADs)
The LADs and NADs contain most of the heterochromatin from centromeric and pericentromeric chromosomal regions and they are enriched in repressive chromatin marks such as H3K9me2/3 and H4K20me3
Therefore, they can exchange their positions according to Lamin A, B1, and B2 levels
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging.
Although Tau protein hyperphosphorylation and aggregation are hallmarks associated with the progress of the disease
Tau interacts with DNA
AD onset and progression takes place in parallel with the gradual disappearance of Tau from neuronal nuclei and its accumulation in the cytoplasm
In Drosophila melanogaster these changes are coupled to NL dysfunction
Nucleolar chromatin displays hypermethylation of rDNA genes
All these phenomena are linked to the aberrant cell cycle re-entry that aged neurons initiate
Heterochromatin modifications, in turn, result in decreased rRNA synthesis and induce nucleolar stress, affecting ribosome number, protein transduction, and gene expression
In the nervous system, Lamins A/C, B1, and B2 present different expression levels and are instrumental for embryonary development and postnatal survival
While B1 and B2 alterations are involved in various neuropathies, both in humans and mice
It is absent in neurons from the mouse cortex, for instance, and Lamin C is expressed in all neuronal types.
In this respect, recent research performed in a transgenic Drosophila model of tauopathy has demonstrated that Lamin B is implicated in AD onset
Accordingly, significant alterations of lamin gene expression have been recently reported, which mainly affect the LMNA gene and during late AD stages
This work searched for possible alterations of different lamin subtypes in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions in autopsied human tissue obtained along I-VI Braak stages.
Given the critical role of nuclear Tau in pericentromeric heterochromatin repair
We hypothesized that the abnormal cell cycle reentry associated with early AD stages implies a dramatic transformation of the quiescent nucleoskeleton (G0) of postmitotic neurons.
This transformation is implemented in order to acquire a configuration of maximal transcriptional activity, especially nucleolar (G1) and replicative (S) activities.
The creation of this aberrant cycling structure leading to the pathological AD neuron is enabled by fundamental nuclear proteins such as nuclear Tau and Lamins.

Results

Phosphorylated Tau Shifts from Nucleus to Cytosol through AD Progression
Two Tau forms were assayed in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neurons along AD stages and compared with tissue from healthy controls, AT100 and AT8.
We confirm here the previously reported fact that AT100 is found in the nuclei of adult individuals (Figure
Through AD stages III-VI, AT100 immunostaining was gradually vanishing from nuclei, to reach a total cytoplasmic and extracellular localization at AD V-VI stages (Figure
Nuclear AT8 expression, by contrast, was only present in elderly adults (Figure
From AD stages III-VI, AT8 immunopositivity was observed extranuclear in the form of tangles and progressing towards the intensely positive neuropile, extracellular plaques, and ghosts that characterize AD late stages (Figure

Lamin B2 Redistributes in the Nucleoplasm along AD Stages
The most prominent immunopositivity among hippocampal neurons was Lamin B2 (Figure
Along with health conditions and AD stages, neurons were highly positive.
Both in CA1 and CA3, the highest percentage of immunopositive neurons was found at ADIII-IV stages (Figure
A notorious change observed in Lamin B2 was its distribution in the nucleoplasm.
Starting in senile subjects and increasing in early AD stages, Lamin B2 immunopositivity included the whole nucleoplasm of several hippocampal neurons (Figure
The mean intensity in the nucleoplasm almost doubled at intermediate and late AD stages as compared with controls (Figure
The data of mean intensity in the membrane allowed to distinguish two populations (Figure
In contrast, Lamin B1 immunostaining was always limited to the membrane both in healthy and AD conditions and only presented a slight increase at AD V-VI stages (Figure

Lamin A Expression in Cells with Perinuclear Lamin B2
The emergence of B2 positive nucleoplasms signals the senile and early AD stages.
At the AD I-II stages, a significant increase of B2 immunopositivity both in the membrane and in the nucleoplasm of numerous pyramidal neurons is associated with nucleoli displaced to the periphery and signs of neuronal attrition (Figure
Those cells show either a thin and discontinue Lamin A or no immunopositivity to Lamin A. By contrast, cells expressing a robust Lamin A at the inner side of the nuclear membrane do not show signs of nucleolar displacement and Lamin B2 is limited to the membrane (Figure
Both types of cells uniformly occupy CA1 and CA3 regions at early AD
A marked increase of nuclear speckles and spots around the nucleoli and adjacent to the nuclear lamina is observed at AD (I-II) (E,M) and B23 immunofluorescence is not limited to the nucleoli but also dispersed in the cytoplasm (F,N,H,P), and H4K20me3 marks are not only in the nucleolar chromatin (G,O) but also adjacent to the nuclear lamina (H,P).

Neurons Express A from Early AD Stages on
Our results confirm the absence of Lamin A in postmitotic neurons of the human brain, in agreement with previous reports in mouse brain
Hippocampal neurons also lack the expression of Lamin C, which is controversial as it has been previously reported in mice and rats
These reported findings were confirmed in this study both in wild type and triple transgenic AD mice (Supplementary Figure
Intriguingly, adult human neurons require only Lamin B1 and B2 to conform to their NL, while low Lamin A expression is individually regulated by miR-9, a brain-specific microRNA
In this respect, it has been found that each cellular type assembles varied proportions of lamin subtypes to achieve different levels of mechanic stability according to their specific functions
Accordingly, the absence of Lamin A in soft tissues like the brain would favor a flexible nucleus able to interconnect both with the cytoskeleton and with the extracellular matrix
The most outstanding result of this work is the expression of Lamin A in NL of hippocampal neurons of AD patients.
A higher number of immunopositive cells, as well as an increased positive area, where evident at early AD stages.
Dynamically modified expression levels of Lamin A have been reported to take place in response to extrinsic mechanisms (stiffness of extracellular matrix and nucleo-cytoskeletal stress) to protect the genome and to regulate the cell-cycle
This suggests that the anomalous Lamin A expression at early AD stages could be directly associated with excessive DNA damage and the aberrant cell-cycle reentry of hippocampal post-mitotic neurons
In this context, it could also be speculated that the anomalous Lamin A presence is related to the neuropathology or cognitive deficit

Lamin B2 in the Nucleoplasm of AD Neurons
Lamin B1 and B2 are separately assembled, but they interconnect their lattice of fibrils both in the NL and in the nucleoplasm to build a scaffold for heterochromatin
Both molecules are present in human hippocampal neurons as well as in rat cerebral cortex
A significant reduction of B-type lamin expression and morphologic alterations has been reported in cortical neurons of AD patients as well as in a human Tau transgenic Drosophila model
Lamin B1 is fundamental for the assembling of lamins in the NL
Our results indicate minimal changes in B1 immunopositivity, only a slight increase in AD V-VI stages.
By contrast, two remarkable modifications of the expression pattern of Lamin B2 in elderly controls and across all AD stages were observed.
While some neurons present a perinuclear reinforced Lamin B2, in other neurons Lamin B2 was distributed in the nucleoplasm (Figure
AD brains suffer a significant and selective neuronal loss accompanied by progressive synaptic impairments in the surviving neurons affected by the toxic accumulation of Tau aggregates, especially in the hippocampus
Both events have been related to the exit from the quiescent state of postmitotic neurons and their anomalous cell-cycle reentry in response to DNA damage
It is well documented that mitotic cycle proteins are abundant and anomalously expressed in the hippocampus of elderly controls, patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and AD
Nevertheless, a significant difference distinguishes the neurons from elderly controls from those of AD patients.
Senile neurons are not able to progress further than G1, because they express cyclin D, but not cyclin A
On the other hand, neurons from the mild cognitive deficit, and AD patients do express cyclin B and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which allows them to replicate their genome.
In this way, they became tetraploids and remain stuck in G2-M, unable to undergo mitosis
Relating this concept of "vulnerable neurons" to our results we hypothesize that neurons expressing nucleoplasmic Lamin B2 have entered G1 and are preparing to progress to S phase, based in the chromatin organizing role of Lamin B2 during replication, where it redistributes among the replication factories of the nucleoskeleton
Neurons with reinforced Lamin B2, by contrast, are not able to progress further than G1.
It is critical to underline that, although both neuronal types are present in elderly controls and in AD patients, the fact that draws the frontier between aging and neurodegeneration is the appearance of Lamin A in AD neurons stuck in G1
The reinforcing effect of Lamin B2 on the B1 scaffold in early AD neurons modify the NL leading to nucleo-cytoskeleton stress
Lamin A can also activate DNA repairing programs and regulate the cell cycle
A deeper study about the functional implications of perinuclear Lamin A and nucleoplasmic Lamin B2 could be performed using living primary hippocampal neurons cultures where cell cycle can be exogenously triggered
In this work, we confirmed the presence of perinuclear Lamin A and nucleoplasmic Lamin B2 in CA1 neurons of a triple transgenic mouse model (3 × Tg AD model) at the age of 6 months, which corresponds to an early disease stage (Supplementary Figure

Lamin A Associated Epigenetic Changes at Early AD Stages
Replicative aging implies a decrease of the epigenetic marker H3K9me3, which maintains the compacted status of LAD chromatin regions
In postmitotic neurons, however, aging-associated epigenetic regulation is not entirely understood, and this chromatin marker has been found repressing dozens of cell cycle genes
Several reports demonstrate that epigenetic regulation is also driven by changes in the expression levels of lamins
In this respect, a decrease of Lamin B and H3K9me3 has been found in the Drosophila AD model
Accordingly, our results demonstrate that in addition to Lamin B2 modifications, the anomalous Lamin A expression in pyramidal neurons leads to the up-regulation of H4K20me3, which is also one of the epigenetic markers of HGPS
H4K20me3 is a specific marker of constitutive heterochromatin, whose increased expression is associated with the loss of peripheral or total heterochromatin in HPGS and other laminopathies
Nevertheless, its markedly increased expression at early and intermediate AD stages leads us to consider the possibility of an essential role in genome stability, to suppress transcription and recombination of repetitive sequences of constitutive heterochromatin induced by nuclear stress

Nuclear AT8 in Aging Cycling Neurons
Tau presence in neuronal nuclei has been repeatedly reported over the last three decades
This interaction strongly suggests a role in genome organization, which would define its participation in aging and AD
The intrinsically disordered Tau structure undergoes multiple conformational changes upon phosphorylation, which define its function
Among them, AT100 (Tau phosphorylated at Thr212-Ser214 epitope) interacts with global chromatin, progressively increases its nuclear expression with aging, and gradually disappears from the nucleus as AD progresses
This work shows for the first time the nuclear presence of AT8 immunopositivity (Tau phosphorylated at Ser202-Thre205) in aging hippocampal neurons already positive for AT100 (Figure
The nuclear coexistence of several Tau phosphorylated forms has also been found in other neurons (unpublished results).
AT100 and AT8 are emblematic antibodies employed for the postmortem diagnosis of AD because they are markers of cytosolic tangles
Nevertheless, their nuclear localization and the conformation in paper clip originated by the phosphorylation of both epitopes
Elevated content of nuclear AT100 stabilizing chromatin, especially the blocks of constitutive heterochromatin, is characteristic of aging neurons
Some of these neurons abandon their quiescent state to start the cell cycle
The aberrant cell-cycle reentry of these postmitotic senile neurons takes place in parallel with the presence of Lamin B2 in the nucleoplasm activating the replication sites
The remaining neurons show a reinforced perinuclear Lamin B2 without nucleoplasmic expansions, and the presence of nuclear Tau phosphorylated at sites recognized by AT8 and AT100, which indicates the lack of an entry on S phase
The phosphorylation of AT8 site induces a conformational change of Tau marked at AT100 which has been identified with inhibition of replication
In this context, abnormal Lamin A expression establishes the border between senile cycling neurons and cycling AD neurons.
The relevance of this critical step explains why Tau is considered a causal AD event
The progressive decrease of nuclear Tau along I-IV AD stages strongly affects LAD and NAD stability, as the blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin are stabilized by nuclear Tau
Only the increased expression of the repressive histone mark H4K20me3 in LADs from I to IV AD stages allows preventing the complete destabilization of the heterochromatin structure.
Similarly, in Tau-deprived NADs
Although this epigenetic silencing provides a survival alternative for hippocampal neurons through I-IV AD stages, the absence of H4K20me3 at AD V-VI stages indicates a total destabilization of heterochromatin blocks and global chromatin in neurons harboring NFTs
Concerning B23, the displacement of this chaperone from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, as observed in this study, has also been related to cell cycle progression
Further studies would help to explain the role of B23 in the cytoplasm of AD neurons.

Lamin A and Tau Oligomers in Neurons with NFTs
AD start is characterized by abnormal Lamin A expression in up to 50% of hippocampal neurons, which halts them in the G1 phase preventing its further progression across the cell-cycle
The addition of Lamin A to Lamins B1 and B2 gives rise to a reinforced NL that reorganizes the genome and leads to a decisive modification of the nucleus-cytoskeleton dynamics.
Lamin A regulates the expression of cytoplasmic stress fibers, nuclear actin, and nuclear myosin I
As a consequence of the aborted cell cycle, an excess of ectopically induced extranuclear kinases
In these pathological conditions, hyperphosphorylated Tau is no longer able to bind microtubules and self-associates to form prefibrillar oligomers and NFTs (Figure
A significant fraction of hippocampal neurons that redistributed Lamin B2 to the nucleoplasm but lack Lamin A expression progress to the S phase of the cell cycle and become tetraploids
Those neurons will progressively die during early (I-II) and intermediate (III-IV) AD stages until the late (V-VI) stages, where the number of tetraploid neurons significantly decreases
The final balance of this process is that AD brain loss is more than 50% of their neurons, while the remaining survive thanks to Lamin A and Tau protein (Figure
The immunohistochemical assessment was performed on 4 µm thick dewaxed paraffin sections.
After boiling the sections in a pressure cooker with DIVA decloaking solution (Biocare Medical, LLC, Concord, CA, USA) for epitope recovery, endogenous peroxidases were blocked with Dako Peroxidase Blocking Reagent (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).
Next, diluted primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 • C.
After incubation with the primary antibody and PBS rinses, sections were exposed to the streptavidin-biotin marked secondary antibody.
The peroxidase reaction was visualized with either 3 3-diaminobenzidine or with 3-amino-ethyl-carbazole.
The sections were finally counterstained with hematoxylin (HE), dehydrated and cover-slipped for microscopic observation.
The sections were observed on an Olympus microscope equipped with a digital camera (Amscope, Irvine, CA, USA).
The streptavidin-biotin marked fluorescence-coupled secondary antibodies replaced secondary antibody for confocal microscopy.
Nuclear acids were stained with SYTOX (Table
Cell counting was performed on immunostained sections corresponding to the hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3, by a coauthor that was blind to the analyzed condition.
The total number of neurons inspected (ranging from 50-60 per subject) was used to calculate the percentage of neurons exhibiting immunostaining.
The percentages of neurons were obtained manually using the cell counter plugin.
The contrast was enhanced, sharpness increased, and minor imperfections removed.
They were then processed for quantification utilizing Fiji version 1.47t (ImageJ; Wayne Rasband, Bethesda, MD, USA).
A specific built-in algorithm called color deconvolution plug-in [101] was used to separate the staining of HE and DAB into three different panels, namely, HE (panel 1), DAB only image (panel 2), and background (panel 3).
Panel 2 was converted to grayscale for threshold selection.
The area was selected (region of interest, ROI) by adjusting the size of the brush according to the neuron soma.
From ROI, the software calculated the mean intensity of DAB and the sum of the pixel values in the ROI.
All data were analyzed for normality and variance homogeneity, and several tests were used for statistical comparison.
Control and AD groups were compared using the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively.
The comparison of data from multiple AD stages was performed either with one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett test or with Kruskal-Wallis followed by the Mann-Whitney U test to identify significant differences (* p < 0.05) versus the control group.

Conclusions
Cellular aging bears a close relationship with DNA damage and implies dramatic transformations of function and structure of chromatin
Old postmitotic neurons try to repair their DNA by entering the cell cycle as replicative cells do.
Their vast nucleo-cytoskeleton complexity, however, does not allow them to immortalize like cancer cells, and they die in the attempt
The biological rescue mechanism of neuronal suicide is the reorganization of the nucleo-cytoskeleton through the massive expression of the highly regulated Lamin A
These dramatic changes may contribute to shut down neuronal plasticity, and trigger synaptic dysfunction, as it has been recently demonstrated in vitro
Oblivion quid pro quo death.

Quantification of immunopositivity.
Significant increases of Lamin A in total intensity (K), percentage of positive cells (L), and mean intensity (M).
Each point represents the image analysis of 50 cells per subject in CA1 and CA3 regions.
Graphs express mean ± SD, * p < 0.05.
See the text for further details of image analysis and statistics.

Figure 4. Lamin B2 in pyramidal hippocampal neurons.
Lamin B2 immunopositivity in adults is mostly perinuclear (A,F) and starts appearing in the nucleoplasm in senile subjects (B,G).
Pyramidal neurons in both CA1 and CA3 present either intense perinuclear immunopositivity or homogeneous staining over the nucleoplasm (C-E,H-J), 40× microphotographs, scale bar-10 µm.
Quantification of immunopositivity.
Lamin B2 immunostaining in nucleoplasm increased significantly in the middle and late AD stages (K,M).
The intensity of the membranes clearly reveals two populations of neurons (H, high and low intensity), and Lamin B2 mean intensity increased significantly in AD (L).
Each point represents the image analysis of 50 cells per subject in CA1 and CA3 regions.
Graphs express mean ± SD, * p < 0.05.

Confocal analysis of H4K20me3 (green), and nucleoli immunofluorescence through nucleophosmin antibody (B23, blue) and nucleic acids through SYTOX (red).
Neurons from a senile subject present in CA1 (A) and CA3 (I) scarce positive green marks, and well-delimited nucleoli (B,J), and the epigenetic H4K20me3 marks localized in the nucleolar chromatin (C,D,K,L).
A marked increase of nuclear speckles and spots around the nucleoli and adjacent to the nuclear lamina is observed at AD (I-II) (E,M) and B23 immunofluorescence is not limited to the nucleoli but also dispersed in the cytoplasm (F,N,H,P), and H4K20me3 marks are not only in the nucleolar chromatin (G,O) but also adjacent to the nuclear lamina (H,P).
H4K20me3 immunostaining.
Distribution of H4K20me3 immunopositivity around the nucleolus (NADs) and adjacent to the nuclear lamina (LADs) (Q).
Intensely marked nuclei at AD I-II stages (R) and AD II-IV stages (S) and null to slight positivity at late AD stages (T,L), scale bar-10 µm.

Figure 7. Relationship of Lamin B2 with Lamin A at early AD stages.
Lamin B2 immunopositivity (DAB-brown) covers the nucleoplasm of neurons with nucleoli displaced to the periphery or without nucleoli and signs of degeneration (A,D).
A reinforced Lamin B2 associated with Lamin A (redamino-ethyl-carbazole) characterizes neurons with euchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli (B,C).
In the hippocampus at AD I-II stages the two neuron populations coexist in CA1 (E) and CA3 (F), scale bar-5 µm.
