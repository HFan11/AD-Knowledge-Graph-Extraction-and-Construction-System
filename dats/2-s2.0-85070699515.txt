to the stage of brain development, and did not vary much among the genotypes of the mice (ad).
4rp-τ expression was observed in the mossy fibers, in CA1 pyramidal cells, in the neurons and the neuropil of the subiculum, and in the neuropil of the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (IML) (e).
In the hippocampal CA1 sector, nearly all neurons express 4rp-τ but only few neurons in each mouse line exhibit NFT-like condensation of 4rp-τ in their cytoplasm (arrows), without major differences among the genotypes of the τ-transgenic and τ-APP-double transgenic mice (f-i).
In the frontocentral cortex (a-h), both τ epitopes are expressed in NFT or pretangle-bearing neurons in all types of the abovementioned transgenic mice.
In the CA1 sector of APP23xTAU58 (i) and APP51/16xTAU58 mice (j), a number of CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibited the phosphorylation epitope of Ser396/Ser404 confirming the presence of p-τ in this region.
In all transgenic mouse lines, p-τpositive neurons were also stained with the AT8 antibody detecting p-τ phosphorylated at Ser202/Thr205 (see Fig.
