Transcriptomic Insights into the Response of the Olfactory Bulb to Selenium Treatment in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular senile plaques primarily composed of Aβ peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.
Olfactory dysfunction is an early clinical phenotype in AD and was reported to be attributable to the presence of NFTs, senile Aβ plaques in the olfactory bulb (OB).
Our previous research found that selenomethionine (Se-Met), a major form of selenium (Se) in organisms, effectively increased oxidation resistance as well as reduced the generation and deposition of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation in the olfactory bulb of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3×Tg-AD), thereby suggesting a potential therapeutic option for AD.
In this study, we further investigated changes in the transcriptome data of olfactory bulb tissues of 7-month-old triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mice treated with Se-Met (6 µg/mL) for three months.
Comparison of the gene expression profile between Se-Met-treated and control mice revealed 143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
Among these genes, 21 DEGs were upregulated and 122 downregulated.
The DEGs were then annotated against the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.
The results show that upregulated genes can be roughly classified into three types.
Some of them mainly regulate the regeneration of nerves, such as Fabp7, Evt5 and Gal; some are involved in improving cognition and memory, such as Areg; and some are involved in anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, such as Adcyap1 and Scg2.
The downregulated genes are mainly associated with inflammation and apoptosis, such as Lrg1, Scgb3a1 and Pglyrp1.
The reliability of the transcriptomic data was validated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the selected genes.
These results were in line with our previous study, which indicated therapeutic effects of Se-Met on AD mice, providing a theoretical basis for further study of the treatment of AD by Se-Met.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting a large population worldwide and is mainly characterized by progressive memory loss along with various other symptoms
It involves nearly all the systems of the human body, such as the nervous system, endocrine system, and the immune system
Studies have demonstrated that olfactory function decreases with aging, and the decline in olfaction is a common clinical phenotype of AD
Olfactory dysfunction is prevalent in AD patients, and the functions of odor detection, discrimination, and identification are affected earlier than the decrease in cognitive ability
Thus, olfactory dysfunction is considered a prodromal symptom of AD and has been proposed as a predicting factor of cognitive impairments
The olfactory bulb is the first place that processes olfactory information received from the axons of olfactory receptor neurons
It has been suggested that the olfactory bulb could be a starting point of pathology in AD
In our previous study, we showed that selenomethionine (Se-Met), a major form of selenium in organisms, effectively increased oxidation resistance as well as reduced the production and deposition of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus, cortex, and also the olfactory bulb of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3×Tg-AD)
In addition, we determined the selenium levels in the tissues and organs of AD mice before and after treatment with Se-Met, and found that the level of selenium in brain tissue and olfactory bulb tissue increased significantly, indicating that selenium plays a biological role in the process of Se-Met treatment of AD mice
Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the therapeutic effects of Se-Met on AD, such as Se-Met-activated autophagy to eliminate Aβ and tau, promotion of neurogenesis in the hippocampus and reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain
Gene expression analysis is a useful tool in the study of neurodegenerative disease.
To date, the majority of studies in the literature highlighted interesting genes on the basis of differential mRNA expression profile between control and experimental samples displaying an advantageous trait or the response to drug stimuli
In this study, we investigated changes in the transcriptome data of olfactory bulb tissues in 7-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice after treatment by Se-Met for three months.
We first searched for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly altered (p < 0.05), followed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to find the specific function of the genes and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis to bioassay enrichment of gene sets.
To our knowledge, this is the first effort to study transcriptome sequences in the mouse olfactory bulb that may help understand the role of Se-Met in the treatment of AD.

Results

Differential Gene Expression between 3×Tg-AD Mice and Se-Met-Treated 3×Tg-AD Mice
We selected the differently expressed genes according to the two criteria of (| log (fold change) |> 1) and the significance level (p < 0.05).
The statistics of the number of significant differentially expressed genes are shown in Figure
One hundred forty-three genes were differentially expressed in the Se-Met-treated AD mice compared to the control mice, with 21 genes upregulated and 122 genes downregulated (Table

Overrepresentation Analysis
To determine the function of DEGs, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed (Table
GO results showed that DEGs were involved primarily in cellular responses to xenobiotic stimuli, flavonoid glucuronidation and glucuronate metabolic processes according to biological processes (BP).
In terms of the cellular component (CC) annotation, "extracellular region", "membrane-bounded vesicle" and "basolateral plasma membrane" showed large enrichment.
Regarding the molecular function (MF) annotation, "transferase activity and transferring glycosyl groups", "epidermal growth factor receptor binding", "peptide hormone receptor binding" and "immunoglobulin binding" showed large enrichment.

To further determine which pathways could be directly affected by Se-Met treatment in 3xTg AD mice, DEGs were analyzed using the KEGG PATHWAY database.
A Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.05 was deemed significant.
The DEGs were observed to be mainly part of signaling pathways including "metabolic", "pentose and glucuronate interconversions", "nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism" and "ascorbate and aldarate metabolism" (Figure
A substantial number of other DEGs were also found to participate in different metabolic pathways such as "TNF signaling pathway" and "amino acids metabolism".
To better clarify the genetic differences between Se-Met-treated and control AD mice, we selected the Top 20 upregulated and downregulated genes in the differential genes according to the p-value.

To further investigate the effect of Se-Met on 3×Tg-AD mice, GO and KEGG analyses were performed on the top 20 up-regulated and the top 20 down-regulated genes, respectively.
It was found that in the up-regulated genes, the biological processes most significantly affected by Se-Met are "positive regulation of secretion, neuropeptide signaling pathway and glial cell proliferation.
In the cell components, Se-Met predominantly exerted its effects in the "extracellular region" and "neuron part", etc.

Discussion

Discussion
In the 7-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice, some of the early pathological features of AD began to appear, such as slightly decreased cognitive function, and the formation of Aβ
Moreover, olfactory deficits also occurred before the clinical onset of cognitive deficits and coincided with AD pathology
In our previous study
Thus, AD-associated pathology in OB is also sensitive to pharmacological interventions, such as for those in the cortex and hippocampus
To further clarify the effect of Se-Met treatment on neuropathology and behavioral changes at this time point, we carried out an OB transcriptome analysis, although using this method involves risks of identifying subtle changes at the level of local gene expression that may not be representative of whole brain gene expression.
We found in the GO and KEGG analysis of the total differential genes, "transferase activity and transferring glycosyl groups", "epidermal growth factor receptor binding", "peptide hormone receptor binding" and "immunoglobulin binding" showing large enrichment.
The DEGs were observed to be mainly involved in signaling pathways including "metabolic", "pentose and glucuronate interconversions" and "ascorbate and aldarate metabolism".
Many patients with Alzheimer's disease have associated vascular disease
At the same time, pathological changes, including capillary basement membrane thickening, endothelial cell swelling and hyperplasia
We performed GO analysis of the total differential genes and found that Se-Met has a certain effect on "epidermal growth factor receptor binding" and "peptide hormone receptor binding", which suggests a potential beneficial effect on vascular endothelial cells.
Vascular endothelial cells are the main cellular components that constitute the vascular wall and the blood-brain barrier
They secrete various vasoactive substances, including endothelin, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins, which play important roles in the processes of eliminating brain wastes
Thus, the improvement of vascular endothelial cells might also play a role in the therapeutic effect of Se-Met on AD.
The brain is the organ with the highest cholesterol content and contains 25% of the unesterified cholesterol in the body
Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, almost all cholesterol in the brain is self-synthesized
Neurons are not able to efficiently synthesize cholesterol, and the synthesis of cholesterol is mainly dependent on astrocytes
Most of the cholesterol is transported to neurons by APOE (apolipoprotein E) containing lipoproteins
The increase of cholesterol level in the neuronal cell leads to the increase of β-secretase activity and Aβ generation
Through the enrichment of KEGG, we found that Se-Met could effectively improve the lipid metabolism in 3×Tg-AD mice.
Therefore, we speculated that the improving effect of Se-Met on lipid metabolism might contribute to its effect of protecting neurons and ameliorating the cognitive deficit in AD mice.

Upregulated Genes in 3×Tg-AD (Se-Met) Mice
This work has identified several key genes upregulated after treatment with Se-Met, including Adcyap1, which encodes a member of the glucagon superfamily of hormones that have important roles in the pathogenesis of AD
Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a protein encoded by the Adcypa1 gene that is expressed primarily in sensory neurons, sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and parasympathetic ganglionic neurons.
PACAP has been shown to function as a neuro-hormone, a neurotransmitter, and a neurotrophic factor
It has been demonstrated that PACAP levels start to decline before the onset of AD dementia
This reduction in PACAP level is region specific, targeting vulnerable areas in the AD brain
In addition, PACAP binds to PAC1 receptors and activates adenylate cyclase (AC)-linked signal transduction pathways in cells.
PACAP triggers anti-apoptotic transcriptional target gene expression and inhibits apoptotic signaling responses, including ROS generation, mitochondrial Bax and cytochrome C release, and subsequent caspase-3 activation
Another upregulated DEG, Areg, encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family that is proteolytically processed to generate a mature protein
EGF was reported to prevent Aβ-induced damage to the cerebrovascular system, thus implicating angiogenic pathways as potential therapeutic targets for AD
The Areg-encoded protein is a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has been shown to play a role in immunity, inflammation, tissue repair, and lung and mammary gland development
It was reported that EGFR expression was significantly increased in the OB of AD and that EGFR signaling was necessary for olfactory learning and discrimination
Scg2 is a secreted neuroendocrine marker observed in prostatic small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
It has been demonstrated that the levels of the Scg2-derived peptide secretoneurin decreased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AD mice
Secretoneurin induces dopamine release from nigrostriatal neurons, influences neurite outgrowth, exerts chemotactic effects on monocytes, eosinophils and endothelial cells, and has angiogenic effects
Moreover, Scg2 was also reported to be involved in many biological processes, such as induction of MAPK cascade and negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
Therefore, Se-Met might exert its anti-AD effects through inhibition of apoptotic signaling responses, activation of EGFR signaling and increasing the secretoneurin level.
Evt5 plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation
Fabp7 is known as a brain lipid-binding protein.
It has been demonstrated that the synthesis of Fabp7 by astrocytes in neurogenic niches has implications for neurogenesis in an AD model
Moreover, both upstream modulators of Fabp7 expression including transcription factors Notch and Pax6 and downstream mediators of Fabp7 such as fatty acid-binding proteins, were reported to enhance the cellular uptake of retinoic acid, modulate gene transcription and promote nerve regeneration
In AD, the disruption of neurogenesis results in the loss of normal neural function and the inability to generate a sufficient number of neurons, which ultimately leads to brain dysfunction
Induction of neurogenesis can stimulate self-repair mechanisms in the brain to repair brain regions suffering from degenerative damage.
There are a large number of regenerative and differentiated neural stem cells in OB
Our previous research found that Se-Met promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus
Therefore, we hypothesize that Se-Met could enhance Evt5 and Fabp7 expression and promote neuroregeneration in OB.
Galanin (Gal) is an endogenously expressed neuropeptide
Gal has been reported to have neuroprotective roles in several cases, such as traumatic brain injury, β-amyloid poisoning, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and high-glucose-induced apoptosis
The upregulation of Gal and endocannabinoid systems supported the hypothesis of their neuroprotective roles, which are established prior to the onset of clear clinical cognitive symptoms of the disease

Downregulated Genes in 3×Tg-AD (Se-Met) Mice
Lrg1 is reported to be highly elevated in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and is believed to be an iNPH-specific candidate biomarker in cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF)
Cognitive impairment due to iNPH initially presents as frontal lobe dysfunction with deficits in attention, execution, and thinking.
In an advanced stage of iNPH, short-term memory is impaired like that in AD.
Differentiating iNPH from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is difficult when the cognitive function of the patient is highly impaired
Therefore, we speculate that Lrg1 has a similar function in AD.
It is also reported that the expression level of Lrg1 is correlated with inflammation
Therefore, a significant decrease in the Lrg1 expression level after Se-Met treatment of 3xTg AD mice confirmed that Se-Met has a role in alleviating the inflammation of AD, which agrees with our previous results
Pglyrp1 (peptidoglycan recognition protein 1) is a neutrophil granule protein with antibacterial properties, and when multimerized, it becomes a functional ligand of a triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1), a cell-surface receptor involved in innate immune activation and amplification of inflammatory response to bacterial infections
In addition, Pglyrp1 was also reported to be dysregulated in AD patient sera samples and could be a potential serum biomarker for the identification of AD
Scgb3a1 encodes a small secreted protein that plays a role in inhibiting cell growth
Spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene
Scgb3a1 is a suggested tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell growth and invasion and is methylated and down-regulated in many epithelial cancers
The study found that phosphorylation of Akt in cancer can effectively inhibit the expression of Scgb3a1
Se-Met significantly activated Akt expression in the brain of AD mice
It is speculated that Se-Met might reduce the expression of Scgb3a1 by activating Akt in AD mice.
In summary, we provide comprehensive insights into the transcriptome of 3×Tg-AD mice's OB tissues.
The results showed that upregulated genes mainly regulate the regeneration of nerves, such as Fabp7, Evt5 and Gal; improve cognition and memory, such as Areg; and impact oxidative stress and apoptosis, such as Adcyap1 and Scg2.
The downregulated genes are mainly associated with inflammation and apoptosis, such as Lrg1, Scgb3a1 and Pglyrp1.
This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of Se-Met-treated OB whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq).
Our results revealed a number of genes implicated in AD pathology and drug metabolism after the treatment with Se-Met.
This is in line with previously described effects of Se-Met on AD model mice and provides a theoretical basis for further study of the treatment of AD by Se-Met.
