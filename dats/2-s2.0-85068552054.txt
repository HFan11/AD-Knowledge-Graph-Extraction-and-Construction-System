Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials on the Efficacy and Safety of Donepezil, Galantamine, Rivastigmine, and Memantine for the Treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
To study the impact of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine on cognitive, functional, behavioral, global changes and adverse effects in patients with mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), we screened the literature published before September 2017 in the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science Electronic databases according to the inclusion criteria.
Thirty-six studies were finally determined from 1560 preliminary screened articles.
The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input scale (CIBIC+) were used as valid endpoints.
Of the 36 trials included, meta-analyses of these placebo-control trials showed that there were significant differences between the donepezil, rivastigmine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC+.
Meta-analyses of these placebo-controlled trials showed that there were significant differences between the galantamine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, NPI, and CIBIC+.
These observations suggest that memantine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL 19 changes in AD patients.
However, there was no significant effect according to the ADCS-ADL 23 , NPI, and CIBIC+ tests, which indicated that memantine treatment has no significant effect on these cognitive aspects of AD patients.
Different effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine on AD were found in this study.
According to the results, we conclude that galantamine is effective in treating all aspects of AD and is the first choice for the treatment of AD.
However, due to limited data, we should consider additional data to obtain more stable results.

INTRODUCTION
The relationship between cognitive dysfunction or impairment and Alzheimer's disease AD has been reported in the literature
Meanwhile, cholesterol esterase inhibitors (ChEs) and memantine (Supplementary Table
Since the intrinsic mechanism of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-Is) requires a sufficient amount of residual endogenous acetylcholine, which is available, the therapeutic efficacy is expected to decrease with the severity of dementia.
Cholinesterase inhibitors, which can reduce acetylcholine breakdown in the brain, are widely considered as a treatment options for AD
Therefore, greater atrophy in the brain regions that are responsible for the cholinergic pathway was found in those patients who had no response to donepezil
It has been reported that donepezil is a type of AChE-I that improves cerebral blood flow (CBF), as well as its primary effect on memory function
Galantamine is a newly available cholinergic drug that counteracts AD by specifically and reversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and altering the nicotinic cholinergic receptors, thereby subsequently reducing central cholinergic neurotransmission
The deterioration of cognitive function in patients with AD appears to be mediated by the use of cholinergic drugs such as rivastigmine
Rivastigmine is a novel brain-selective inhibitor of "pseudo-irreversible" AChE, whose metabolism is almost completely independent of the cytochrome P450 system
Memantine protects neurons against the overstimulation of NMDA receptors, which occurs in AD and thus causes glutamate-and calcium-mediated neurotoxicity
Evidence of the efficacy of memantine has been shown primarily in patients with moderate or severe AD
The etiology and pathogenesis of AD are not well understood, but central cholinergic neurons are found to be impaired in AD patients with low choline intake and reduced choline synthesis
The central cholinergic system plays a key role in regulating learning, memory and attention.
AChE-Is is a major drug in the clinical management of AD
AchE-Is such as donepezil and galantamine show a significant effect on mild-to-moderate AD
Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, which belong to the group of ChE inhibitors (ChE-Is), are capable of cognitive, functional and behavioral improvement; however, none of them has been shown to be effective in the progression of AD
Currently, AchE-Is, including donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, are standard treatments for slowing disease progression
In addition, high dropout rates and adverse-effectinduced dropouts were observed in randomized clinical trials of these drugs.
Therefore, the safety of ChE-Is and memantine has been proposed.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine in AD to elucidate the efficacy and safety of these drugs.
We sought to elaborate on previous reviews and include a broad range of outcome measures to determine the extent to which these drugs have varying degrees of effects on cognitive, behavioral and functional impairment in AD patients at different stages of severity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Search Strategy
PubMed (from 1966 to September 2017), EMBASE (from 1980 to September 2017), Web of science (from 1986 to September 2017) and the Cochrane Library (September 2017) were searched.
The following search terms were used: "Alzheimer Disease" or "AD, " "Donepezil, " "Galantamine, " "Memantine, " "Rivastigmine, " or combination of these words.

Selection Criteria
The inclusion criteria for the meta-analyses were as follows:
(1) full-text publications written in English; (2) double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, with random assignment to donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine; (2) inclusion of patients with or probably with AD diagnosis, according to the fourth edition of the Mental Disorders Diagnostics and Statistics Manual (DSM-IV) and the National Association of Nervous and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease Institute of Standards (NINCDS-ADRDA)
Studies with fatal defects in research design or data analysis were excluded, and trials with no readily available data were also excluded.
Studies were excluded for the following reasons: (1) not randomized controlled trials, such as case reports, reviews, and meta-analysis; (2) family-based studies; (3) lack of original data, such as meeting abstracts, and case reports/series; (4) non-human studies; and (5) publication in a language other than English.

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Data abstraction was performed as a collaboration between two researchers using standard data extraction by discussing with other team members or by asking for the exact data from the original investigators.
For missing data, we sought missing information and essential clarification from the authors.
For measure variables, there is an approximate or direct algebraic relationship with standard deviation (SD), which we obtained from the standard error, confidence interval, t-value, or p-value related to the differences between the two sets of means.
We obtained the following baseline variables from each study: sample size, age, sex, race, design, dosing, blinding, duration of the trial, baseline cognitive score (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE), random numbers, secondary outcomes, and AEs that led to dropouts during the double-blind trials.

Types of Outcome Measures
The measurement scales used in the tests varied.
Therefore, we recorded measurement scales based on the general areas being assessed, namely, cognition, function, behavior and global assessment of change.
Next, we attempted to determine a single measurement scale, which is the most commonly used key outcome measure in each area.
We engaged the ADAScog, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Research-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), NPI and Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input scale (CIBIC+) as primary measurements to assess the effects of different drugs on the cognition, function, behavior, and global assessment of change (Supplementary Table
The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living 19-or 23-item scale (ADCS-ADL 19/23), which is based on interviews with caregivers or others close to the patients, was used as a scale to assess how the patients cope with daily activities.
The 19-item subset was used for patients with moderate to severe AD, and the 23-item subset was used for patients with mild to moderate AD.
In addition, to assess the efficacy and safety of these drugs, we recorded discontinuations of the trials due to AEs and dropouts due to adverse effects and other reasons.

Statistical Analysis
Meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.3 software.
For continuous data collected using the same measurement scale (e.g., cognition and behavior), we calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for changes from the baseline or final values.
For dichotomous clinical outcomes, dropouts, and AEs, we performed odds ratios (ORs), absolute risk differences, 95% CI and p values to assess the efficacy and safety of the studied drugs.
Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q-statistic and I 2 tests
I 2 approximates the ratio of the total variance in effect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error.
Heterogeneity of the index is considered when p < 0.10 and I 2 > 50%.
The latent retrieval bias was evaluated by the MD or SMD funnel plot in the main results of each test.

RESULTS

Literature Search Findings
The search strategy yielded 1,560 citations in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. Figure
A total of 573 potentially relevant articles were identified in the original search, but only 36 were ultimately selected for meta-analysis.
Of these, fifteen donepezil trials
The design and population characteristics of the ChE-Is and memantine tests are shown in Table

DISCUSSION
Different methods of measurement were used in assessing treatment outcomes.
We divided the impact into four parts, cognitive function, functional outcome, behavioral outcome, and global assessment.
In this article, we presented a metaanalysis of the effects of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine (Supplementary Table
We obtained data from 6611 AD patients across 36 trials.
Meta-analyses of these placebo-controlled trials showed that there were significant differences between the donepezil and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC+, between the galantamine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, NPI, and CIBIC+, between the rivastigmine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC+, and between the memantine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, and ADCS-ADL 19 (Supplementary Table
This observation suggests that donepezil is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in cognitive function, functional outcome, and global assessment change in AD patients.
Analysis of the entire database showed consistent results, which indicated positive results with the donepezil treatment and improvement in the condition of mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, and severe AD patients.
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to reveal the favorable performance of donepezil with mild-tomoderate, moderate-to-severe, and severe AD.
This observation suggests that galantamine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in cognitive function, functional outcome, behavior outcome and global assessment change in AD patients.
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to reveal the favorable performance of galantamine with mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, and severe AD.
This observation suggests that rivastigmine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in cognitive function, functional outcome, and global assessment change in AD patients.
Analysis of the entire database showed consistent results, which indicated positive results with rivastigmine treatment and improvement in the condition of mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, and severe AD patients.
There was no significant effect on the outcome of NPI-assessed behavioral therapy, except galantamine.
This observation suggests that memantine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in cognitive function, and functional outcome change in AD patients.
However, there was no significant effect according to the ADCS-ADL 23 , NPI, and CIBIC+ tests, which indicated that memantine treatment has no significant effect on these cognitive aspects of AD patients.
Safety and tolerability are as important as the effectiveness of the interventions in clinical research.
In the current metaanalysis, when any AE, dropout caused by any reason, or adverse effect was considered in all patients or subgroups, significant differences were found between the galantamine or rivastigmine groups and the placebo group, which indicated that donepezil and galantamine were not sufficiently safe and tolerable for AD treatment.
However, no significant difference was found in all patients or subgroups when the donepezil group and the placebo group were compared, which indicates that donepezil is safe and tolerable enough for AD treatment.
When any AE, dropout caused by any reason, or adverse effect was considered, no significant difference was found between the memantine group and the placebo group in all patients or subgroups, which indicates that memantine is safe and tolerable enough for AD treatment.
On the other hand,
Compared with the published meta-analysis
Therefore, based on the current statistical conclusion, we have determined that we prefer galantamine for the treatment of AD.
However, due to limited data, we should also consider additional data to obtain more stable results.
This analysis is subject to the number of limitations.
First, although all studies are short-lived, the duration of the study is still a variable and may be a factor to consider.
Second, the results of neuropsychiatric symptoms are based on a relatively small number of trials.
This can affect the wider range of estimates.
Third, meta-analysis data come only from published scientific literature, and some negative results and non-statistical data are difficult to publish; therefore, there is publication bias.
Fourth, the genetic backgrounds of these patients involved in our analysis were different, which could potentially influence the rivastigmine treatment.
Finally, some of our trials used flexible drug doses.
Overall, the results indicate benefits in cognition but the efficacy on functional, behavioral, and global change symptoms is questionable in patients with mild to moderate to severe AD.
Our results might suggest a possible perspective for anti-dementia drug trials, such as increasing placebo effects over time and heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.
The results of this study still need to be confirmed by further studies.

CONCLUSION
Our analysis is the first attempt to incorporate available direct or indirect evidence to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 4 drugs in the treatment of AD.
The results suggest that donepezil exhibited a significant positive efficacy with respect to cognition, function, behavior, and global change.
However, the efficacy of rivastigmine or galantamine in behavioral outcome is questionable in patients with mild to moderate to severe AD.
The efficacy of memantine on global assessment is questionable in patients with mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe AD.
This review shows that donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine can delay cognitive impairment in patients with mild-to-moderate-to-severe AD for at least 52 weeks.
Based on the current statistical conclusions, galantamine is effective in treating all aspects of AD and may be the first choice in the treatment of AD.
However, due to limited data, we should also consider additional data to obtain more stable results.
