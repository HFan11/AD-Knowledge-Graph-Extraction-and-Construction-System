Magnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment
Research utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been crucial to the understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms behind and clinical identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
MRI modalities show patterns of brain damage that discriminate AD from other brain illnesses and brain abnormalities that are associated with risk of conversion to AD from MCI and other behavioural outcomes.
This review discusses the application of various MRI techniques to and their clinical usefulness in AD and MCI.
MRI modalities covered include structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labelling (ASL), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI).
There is much evidence supporting the validity of MRI as a biomarker for these disorders; however, only traditional structural imaging is currently recommended for routine use in clinical settings.
Future research is needed to warrant the inclusion for more advanced MRI methodology in forthcoming revisions to diagnostic criteria for AD and MCI.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia.
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal form of AD and is characterized by neurocognitive dysfunction, but not to the extent of dementia, and minor difficulties in functional ability.
The neuropathological hallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and beta-amyloid (Aβ) neuritic plaques.
The AD brain contains increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau.
In this state, the main functions of normal tau are disrupted and the polymerization of paired helical filaments or NFTs, which are correlated with synaptic loss, occurs.
Overproduction of amyloid precursor protein is also characteristic in AD, which results in elevated levels of Aβ 42 and neuritic plaque formation.
This exerts oxidative and inflammatory stress, which contributes to neuronal damage
Through the in vivo visualization of neuropathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has been paramount in the clinical identification of MCI and AD.
Diagnostic criteria recommend the consideration of abnormalities on structural MRI
More advanced MR techniques include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labelling (ASL), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which have not yet been established for routine clinical use.
The aim of this review will be to provide an overview of the application of the various MR modalities in AD and MCI.
Another clinically useful neuroimaging technology is positron emission tomography (PET)

Structural imaging
Structural imaging modalities reveal brain atrophy and other static tissue abnormalities (Table
Progression of atrophy follows Braak staging
Compared to controls, hippocampal volumes for AD patients are reduced by 26-27% and ERC volumes by 38-40%
MCI patients show intermediate levels of MTL atrophy
The presence of diffuse hippocampal atrophy is related to deficits in executive functioning and memory for AD patients
As the disease progresses, atrophy advances to the remainder of the MTL where grey matter (GM) loss occurs in the medial temporal gyrus, parahippocampus, parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, and temporal pole
Nesteruk and colleagues
It also differentiates AD from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), where AD patients show the greatest reductions in hippocampal volume
Additional limbic structures including the amygdala, olfactory bulb tract, cingulate gyrus, and thalamus are impacted in AD
GM loss in these regions is associated with cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptomatology
As the disease progresses, atrophy spreads to cortical regions.
Frontal, parietal, and temporal brain areas experience volumetric reductions, and so do the putamen and basal forebrain cholinergic system
Cholinergic abnormalities in AD have been further highlighted through the use of molecular imaging technologies
Atrophy is also found in the primary olfactory cortex
MCI is notable for frontal and temporal GM loss, and atrophy in the primary olfactory cortex and some basal forebrain cholinergic system structures
No volumetric differences were found between AD patients with and without hypertension
Structural MRI scans can also display white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which indicate demyelination and axonal loss
Compared to controls, patients with AD demonstrate greater WMHs with the majority in frontal lobe
For patients along the AD spectrum, WMHs correlate with hippocampal atrophy
Considering differential diagnoses, patients with vascular dementia (VaD) have higher volumes of WMHs than in AD
Periventricular WMHs are predictive of progression from MCI to AD, with an increase of one point in WMH rating associated with a 59% increased risk of phenoconversion

Advanced MR techniques
DTI utilizes the displacement of water molecules to measure white matter tract integrity (Table
The primary metrics of DTI include mean diffusivity (MD) or the average rate of water molecule diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) or the variability associated with diffusion
In AD, increased MD is noted in frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal areas including the hippocampus; however, in MCI, these increases are absent in frontal and occipital regions.
In AD, decreased FA is localized to the cingulum, corpus callosum, superior lateral fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus and throughout temporal, occipital and frontal white matter.
Patients with MCI display a similar pattern, but with no FA irregularities in occipital and parietal areas
MD increases in the basal forebrain are associated with increased risk of progression from MCI to AD
Diffusivity metrics also discriminate AD from other dementias where reduced FA is present in frontal areas for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) compared to AD, and increased MD is present in parietal and temporal regions for AD in contrast to DLB
However, DTI technology shows particular sensitivity to motion, which could lead to artifacts that might skew results.
Comparatively long scanning times could increase the probability of such errors
indicating that this technique may not be particularly well suited for practical clinical use.
Changes in the neurovasculature system, namely in cerebral blood flow (CBF), can be detected by MR imaging using ASL (Table
Notable hypoperfusion is present in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and, occipital, temporal, parietal cortical areas in AD and MCI, and in frontal and orbitofrontal cortex, and the hippocampus in AD.
AD patients demonstrate greater CBF declines in cortex found in temporal, parietal, frontal, and orbitofrontal areas, in addition to the thalamus and middle temporal structures including the hippocampus and amygdala when compared to those with MCI
Limited increases in CBF have been shown in the basal ganglia, amygdala, and hippocampus in MCI, and anterior cingulate in AD, which suggests compensatory mechanisms within the brain for cerebrovascular damage
Regarding disease-related outcomes, regional hypoperfusion is associated with progression from MCI to AD, in addition to cognitive and functional deterioration
Measures of perfusion on ASL also discriminate AD from VaD, DLB, and FTD.
Differential patterns of CBF reduction were shown in frontal and temporal areas when comparing AD to VaD.
Whilst demonstrating the highest degree of hypoperfusion throughout the brain, temporal regions are spared in DLB.
In comparison, reduced temporal and frontal CBF is characteristic of AD and FTD, respectively
ASL utilizes magnetically labelled blood water as a tracer and individual differences in blood vessel properties could MRS Meta-analysis of 29 studies In the posterior cingulate, Cho/Cr ratios are increased, and NAA/mI ratios are decreased for AD patients.
In the hippocampus, mI/Cr ratios are increased for AD patients lead to variable transit times for its delivery.
This might result in artificial changes in signal intensity, which a clinician might mistake as a disease-related abnormality in CBF.
Another barrier to the employment of ASL in clinical practice is its low signal to noise ratio, which leads to reductions in image quality
MRS assesses brain metabolite levels and its parameters are expressed as concentration or ratios to standardize values
When examining region-specific changes in AD, lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and NAA/Creatine(Cr) and higher myo-Inositol (mI) and mI/Cr ratios are found in parietal regions.
Parietal NAA/mI ratios are also deemed a valid discriminator of AD
In MCI, NAA/mI ratios are lowered and Choline(Cho)/Cr ratios are increased in the posterior cingulate gyrus, whereas mI/Cr ratios are increased in the hippocampus
Clinically, decreased NAA markers are predictive of phenoconversion to dementia and cognitive dysfunction
NAA/Cr and NAA/mI ratios discriminate AD from VaD, and glutamate/Cr ratios differentiate DLB from AD. Metabolic ratios are substantially lower in AD patients compared to VaD, but higher in widespread brain regions relative to DLB
Whilst MRS is able to study molecular processes in the brain non-invasively without exposure to ionizing radiation, this technique is limited by its low sensitivity
Resultant attenuated signal strength makes it difficult to recommend its use by clinicians for diagnostic purposes in AD and MCI.

Functional imaging
Functional MRI generates dynamic representations of brain activity through bold oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which measures changes in blood flow and volume
On memory tasks, patients with AD show no or less activation of hippocampal and other medial temporal structures when compared to controls.
Findings of increased brain activity during encoding in parietal and posterior cingulate areas indicate some degree of compensation by the brain in lieu of medial temporal dysfunction
Patients with MCI have demonstrated similar hippocampal deactivation to those with AD during recall
fMRI findings in AD extend to tasks of working memory, visuospatial ability, attention, semantic knowledge, and motor performance
Resting-state fMRI provides insight into functional connectivity among structures in intrinsic networks implicated in the AD spectrum (Table
One particular network of interest is the default mode network (DMN), where increased neural activity is shown at rest compared to task engagement.
Brain structures implicated in the DMN include the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferolateral temporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus
Abnormal coactivation at rest in AD was shown between medial temporal structures such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
This evidences the significance of the MTL in the DMN and establishes altered connectivity in the DMN as an indicator for AD.
Levels of PCC connectivity to other DMN structures is associated with neuropsychological impairment and declines in PCC-retrosplenial cortex connectivity is associated with lower Aβ levels in the CSF for AD patients
There is a decrease in posterior and an increase in anterior and ventral DMN regions early in AD. 2-4 years later all regions show marked declines in connectivity
This supports the notion that early mechanistic compensation occurs intrinsically within the DMN, but eventually global neurodegeneration occurs.
This pattern of DMN dysfunction has been noted in MCI with limited increases in activation between DMN structures, indicative of prodromal compensatory mechanisms
Other large-scale brain networks that show disruption in AD include thalamo-cortical, dorsal attention, visual, and sensorimotor ones
Whilst fMRI provides unique insight into pathophysiology, its use in the clinical routine is not supported
This is due to primary limitations including a low signal or contrast to noise ratio and the questionable validity of BOLD signal as a measure of neuronal activity.
Unexplained variability in this signal might result from hemodynamic factors that are not controlled for

Conclusions
AD is a devastating illness that leads to cognitive impairment and functional deterioration.
MRI modalities have shown substantial utility in identifying biomarkers for AD and MCI pathology.
These, in turn, can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy and develop novel molecular-based treatment interventions.
Whilst only traditional structural modalities are recommended for diagnosis in clinical practice of MCI and AD, there is a need for further research to overcome methodological limitations of more advanced ones, which provide unique insight into disease-specific patterns of neuropathology.
This should hopefully warrant their inclusion in diagnostic criteria for MCI and AD in the future.
For selected areas, MCI patients showed greater activation than AD patients Thiyagesh et al.
