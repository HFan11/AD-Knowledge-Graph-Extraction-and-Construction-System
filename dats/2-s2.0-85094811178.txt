Hybridization of Curcumin Analogues with Cinnamic Acid Derivatives as Multi-Target Agents Against Alzheimer’s Disease Targets
The synthesis of the new hybrids followed a hybridization with the aid of hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBT) and 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI.HCL) in dry DMF or thionyl chloride between curcumin analogues and cinnamic acid derivatives.
IR, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, LC/MS ESI + , and elemental analysis were used for the confirmation of the structures of the novel hybrids.
The lipophilicity values of compounds were calculated theoretically and experimentally via the reversed chromatography method as R M values.
The novel derivatives were studied through in vitro experiments for their activity as antioxidant agents and as inhibitors of lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2, and acetyl-cholinesterase.
All the compounds showed satisfying anti-lipid peroxidation activity of linoleic acid induced by 2,2 -azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH).
Hybrid 3e was the most significant pleiotropic derivative, followed by 3a.
According to the predicted results, all hybrids could be easily transported, diffused, and absorbed through the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
They presented good oral bioavailability and very high absorption with the exception of 3h.
No inhibition for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 was noticed.
According to the Ames test, all the hybrids induced mutagenicity with the exception of 3d.
Efforts were conducted a) to correlate the in vitro results with the most important physicochemical properties of the structural components of the molecules and b) to clarify the correlation of actions among them to propose a possible mechanism of action.
Docking studies were performed on soybean lipoxygenase (LOX) and showed hydrophobic interactions with amino acids.
Docking studies on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) exhibited: (a) hydrophobic interactions with TRP281, LEU282, TYR332, PHE333, and TYR336 and (b) π-stacking interactions with TYR336.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia.
According to World Alzheimer's report 2019, over 50 million people worldwide are living with dementia, and this number is expected to be increased to more than 152 million by 2050
Multiple neurochemical pathways are involved in the pathology of AD.
Several factors have been implicated in the development of AD.
Thus, the rationale for multi-target therapy becomes evident when reviewing the multiple neurochemical pathways common to the disease.
AD is mainly characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of the Tau protein in the brain
Chronic brain inflammation and oxidative stress also appear in AD.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) plays a crucial role in AD patients.
Recently, the role In the last decade, researchers have focused on curcumin analogues with anti β-secretase or betasite amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), amyloid precursor protein APP, α-and β-secretases (Aβ fibrils aggregation), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) (NTFs formation), metal accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction (oxidative stress), interleukin 6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa (NF-kB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 5-LOX (neuro-inflammation), and AChE inhibition
Influential structural modifications of curcumin that improve its stability and solubility involve (i) the elimination of the hydrolysis-prone keto-enol functionality
Both structural modifications avoid the extraordinarily rapid decomposition While curcumin has received the label of being pharmacodynamically fierce (hits many targets) yet pharmacokinetically feeble, these results apparently have not deterred researchers interested in the design, synthesis, and development of curcumin analogues

In an attempt to obtain more potent curcumin analogues to keep the biological properties and safety profile intact, we conducted biological studies on various synthetic derivatives of curcumin mainly focused on changes in the β-diketone structure and the aryl substitution scaffold.
Therefore, we synthesized a number of compounds: (a) by replacing the piperidinone ring by a five-membered ring, like cyclopentanone (1k); (b) replacing the nitrogen in the piperidinone ring by an oxygen (1l and 1m) or a sulfur (1n); and (c) replacing the carbonyl group of the piperidinone by a C=S group (1o and 1p).
The drug-likeness of the derivatives (final hybrids and curcumin analogues) was determined from the theoretical calculation of various molecular properties.
The in silico results were evaluated, and the violations of Lipinski's rule were considered using several platforms as well as the prediction of Absorbance, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, Toxicology, ADMET properties and toxicity.
The gathered information supported the synthesis of the hybrid compounds in an effort to define the importance and correlation of lipophilicity and the steric and electronic parameters on the biological activities and to improve them.

Lawesson's reagent is a mild and convenient thionating agent for ketones, esters, and amides that allows for the preparation of thioketones, thioesters, and thioamides in good yields.

It seems that the volume of Substituent A influenced the yield of the reaction.

Physicochemical Studies

Experimental Determination of Lipophilicity as RM Values
Since lipophilicity is described as a major physicochemical parameter that affects ligand-target binding interactions, solubility, ADME (absorption, distribution, bioavailability, metabolism, and elimination), and toxicological effects, we considered it important to experimentally determine this The synthesis of cinnamic acids 2a-c was established by the Knoevenagel-Doebner condensation of the suitable aldehyde with malonic acid in the presence of pyridine and piperidine as we have earlier reported
The structural characterization of the new curcumin analogues 3a-h was based on their spectral data and elemental analyses.
For example, the IR spectra of compounds revealed an absorption band at 1669-1659 cm -characteristic to carbonyl group of the curcumin analogue and to the amide group of the hybrid.
Their 1 H-NMR spectra revealed two signals at δ 7.67-7.96
ppm assignable to vinylic protons of benzylidenes.
The survey of the 13 C-NMR spectra of title compounds revealed that the carbonyl carbon was displayed downfield at >189 ppm and the amidic carbonyl group at >165 ppm.
The LC-MS results pointed to the presence of [M + CH 3 OH] + , [M + CH 3 OH + Na] + , and [M + Na] + .
The physicochemical properties of the novel derivatives are given in the experimental section.

Physicochemical Studies

Experimental Determination of Lipophilicity as R M Values
Since lipophilicity is described as a major physicochemical parameter that affects ligand-target binding interactions, solubility, ADME (absorption, distribution, bioavailability, metabolism, and elimination), and toxicological effects, we considered it important to experimentally determine this property as R M values.
The RPTLC (reverse phase thin layer chromatography) method, which has been characterized as a secure, rapid, and appropriate technique for expressing lipophilicity, was applied (Table
We tried to correlate the milog P values, the theoretically calculated lipophilicity in one equation, with the R M values of all the compounds (Table
However this attempt was found to be unsuccessful.
The perusal of the lipophilicity values of hybrids showed that 3a, 3b, 3e, and 3f are lipophilic compounds when counting the experimental/theoretical lipophilicity values.
Considering the curcumin analogues, it seemed that only for 1k and 1m was there an agreement in both experimental/theoretical values.
Hybrids 3c and 3h presented the lowest lipophilicity-as R M values-among the hybrids (negative scale), as well as similar (-0.658/-0.657;
Table
This disagreement could be attributed to several factors, e.g., different solvation, silanophilic interaction, H-bridges, and differences in chemical structures.

In Silico Determination of Drug-Likeness
Drug-likeness qualitatively assesses the possibility for a molecule to become an oral drug with respect to bioavailability.
Nowadays, experimental procedures for the determination of human pharmacokinetic properties have been progressively replaced by in silico procedures since the computational tools are faster, simpler, and more cost-effective
Herein, we used a variety of useful in silico methods to screen the ADMET properties of our compounds for comparison reasons.
We simultaneously analyzed the used curcumin analogues and the final hybrids.
In this regard, we obtained and entered in the online software versions of (i) Molinspiration software version 2016.10 (www.molinspiration.com)
[59], (ii) the MolSoft platform (
[62], (iv) the preADMET platform (
[63], and (v) the SwissADME platform (
According to Lipinski's rule, the poor absorption or permeation is related to the presence of more than 5 H-bond donors and 10 H-bond acceptors.
Furthermore, values of the molecular weight (MW) > 500 and calculated log P value > 5 lead to poor absorption/permeability.
We noticed that all hybrids (3a-h) presented high lipophilicity values and MWs (Table
We calculated the molecular properties predictors via the MolSoft platform (Table
The percentage of absorption (%ABS) was calculated by using %ABS = 109 -(0.345 × topological polar surface area (TPSA))
With the exception of hybrid 3h and the analogue 1f, all the other hybrids presented a very high absorption-higher than curcumin.
The log S values were found to be very low compared to the corresponding curcumin (Table
All the curcumin analogues also presented high absorption % values.
The bioavailability of bioactive molecules is characterized by their TPSA.
This descriptor is highly correlated with the hydrogen bonding properties of a molecule.
The TPSA values of the hybrids were observed in the range of 34.38-77.84
Å 2 , whereas curcumin analogues 1a-q showed TPSA values 11.17-44.60
Å 2 (1f with 68.44 was the only exception).
These values were lower the limit of 160 Å 2 underlying a good oral bioavailability.
The upper limit for the TPSA for a molecule to penetrate the brain is around 90 Å 2 .
Thus, all these molecules are able to penetrate the brain (Table
LogBB is important in silico parameter to identify CNS-active agents.
Since these hybrids were designed as agents to target Alzheimer's disease, we theoretically calculated logBB values using the logP and TPSA values and the following equation.
Compounds with logBB values higher than 0.3 are considered to have a high absorption through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and logBB values between 0.3 and -0.1 and lower are not considered to be absorbed in general through the BBB
It seems that all hybrids could be easily transported, diffused, and absorbed through the BBB.
The BBB biological scores ranged from 3.27 to 5.74 (3h presented a value of 2.45), whereas curcumin showed a score of 2.83.
The prediction of CYP metabolism and excretion of the hybrids using the CypRules showed no inhibition for the CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.
Similarities were observed among the results using the SwissADME platform (Table
The toxicity assessment of the synthesized compounds was calculated by the preADMET platform.
PreADMET predicts toxicity to TA98, TA100, and TA1535 (strains of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium that carry mutations in genes involved in histidine synthesis) that are often used in the Ames test.
The actual value of the prediction result was "positive" (change of population) or "negative" (no change of population).
With the exception of 3d, all the other hybrids induced mutagenicity according to the Ames test.
Using PreADMET, we predicted the carcinogenicity for the synthesized hybrids.
The results from this model, which were built from the data of NTP (National Toxicology Program) and US FDA, were the results of the in vivo carcinogenicity tests of mice and rats for two years.
"Negative" suggests clear evidence of carcinogenic activity, and "Positive" underlines the absence-no evidence of carcinogenic activity.
Only 3d gave a positive sign in mice, whereas a negative one was observed for rats.
However, we could see that although 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3g hybrids were predicted with positive sign to the rat assay, the calculation pointed to negativity against mice (Table
In the future, we will try to perform in vivo experiments in order to define the carcinogenicity of the most potent compound.
The SwissADME, Ghose (Amgen), Veber (GSK), Egan (Pharmacia), and Muegge (Bayer) methods give multiple estimations that allow for consensus views or the selection of methods best fitting the end-user's specific needs in terms of chemical space.

Biological Evaluation
In this research, the curcumin analogues and the novel hybrids were evaluated in vitro as pleitropic agents, e.g., inhibitors of (i) soybean lipoxygenase, bovine COX-2, eel AChE, and (ii) lipid peroxidation.
Cell metabolism is the source for the continuously production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Some are characterized as highly toxic, and various cellular enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms offer a rapid detoxification.
Their extreme reactivity and the tendency to induce chain reactions lead to pathological processes.
Earlier studies have shown a significant enhancement of lipid peroxidation in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
Thus, antioxidants inhibiting brain lipid peroxidation could aid their treatment.
We found it interesting to determine their anti-lipid peroxidation activities in comparison to a well-known antioxidant, i.e., Trolox (Table
We used the water-soluble 2,2 -azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH) to generate in vitro peroxyl radicals through spontaneous thermal decomposition.
The derived experimental conditions resembled cellular lipid peroxidation due to the activity of the undertaken radicals.
The 1k, 1m, 1n, and 1p compounds (100%) were the most active inhibitors among the curcumin analogues, whereas 1j, 1l, 1o, and 1q exhibited moderate or very low activity at 100 µM concentration (8-42%).
It seemed that lipophilicity was the main influence on anti-lipid peroxidation.
A higher lipophilicity leads to higher activity.
Thus, 1l, which has a lipophilicity value of 3.91, and 1o, which has a lipophilicity value of 4.62, presented lower activity (42% and 8%, respectively) compared to 1m with a value of 5.87 (100%), 1k with 6.42 (100%), and 1p with 6.58 (100%).
The nature of the six-membered heteroatom ring did not seem to influence the antioxidant ability, e.g., as in curcumin derivatives 1m and 1p.
Both presented a 100% anti-lipid peroxidation.
The cinnamic acids (2a-c) seemed to be equipotent.
Overall, the hybrids presented a high anti-lipid peroxidation activity (84-93%; Table

The activation of brain lipoxygenases is an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
Novel research has underlined a new role for 5-LOX in regulating endogenous Tau metabolism in the central nervous system, thus supporting the theory that the inhibition of 5-LOX could be beneficial for Tau neuropathology
Due to a lack of sufficiently-purified human LOX enzymes, most research has been done on soybean LOX
Experimental results have shown a sufficient qualitative correlation between inhibition values of the two LOX enzymes
In our assays, we used isozyme LOX-1, which uses free fatty acids as substrates
A perusal of the %/IC 50 (Inhibitory concentration) LOX inhibition values (Table
Considering the structural characteristics, we could see that 1k > 1p > 1b > 1m > 1n.
It seemed that within the derivatives of the naphthyl substituted curcumin analogues, the potency was related with the nature of the five-or six-membered ring.
The cyclopentanone led to a potent LOX inhibitor.
In continuation, among the six-membered substituted analogues, the carbonyl group in compound 1p had been replaced by a C=S group.
Compound 1b presented an IC 50 value very close to the previous analogue.
Replacement by a tetrahydro-4H-pyranone (1m) or by a tetrahydro-4H-thiopyranone ring (1n) diminished the activity.
Analogues 1l and 1o presented very low activities (<10%).
The higher lipophilicity of 1p (6.58) compared to 1o (4.62) led to higher inhibitory activity.
For the sake of comparison, the previously published results for 1a-g compounds
It seemed that the presence of heterocyclic rings as substituents in Substituent A did not positively affect the activity (1a-g and 1q).
Among the cinnamic acids 2a-c, the most active LOX inhibitor was 2c, followed by 2b and 2a
In our experiments, the hybrids exhibited IC 50 values ranged from 34 to 82 µM.
Among the tested compounds, the most interesting representatives were 3h and 3c.
It is known that LOXs contain a "non-heme" iron per molecule in the enzyme-active site.
As a consequence, LOX inhibitors (a) can reduce the iron species in the active site to the catalytically inactive ferrous form or (b) can act as ligands for Fe 3 .
Hybrid 3h contained the scaffold of caffeic acid and might act as a ligand for Fe 3 through the two vicinal hydroxyl moieties.
The literature gives evidence for a positive role of lipophilicity for LOX inhibitors
However, in this dataset, lipophilicity did not seem to be correlated with LOX inhibition (theoretical lipophilicity values milog P 3h < 3c; experimental R M values were found to be similar 3c = 3h).
We tested, in vitro, the inhibitory activity of the compounds on acetylcholinesterase activity using acetyl-thiocholine as a substrate
The ability of these compounds to act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can help AD patients and may contribute to the mechanisms of action of reported structurally related curcumin analogues and/or cinnamic acids derivatives
Among the tested hybrids, the most active representatives were 3e > 3a > 3g (Table
In all cases, the moiety of cinnamic acid corresponded to the substituted naphthyl.
The thienyl curcumin analogue led to the more potent hybrid (3e).
Hybrids 3b, 3c, 3d, 3f, and 3h showed a very low activity (14-34%).
The % inhibition values for the curcumin analogues given in Table
Cinnamic acids also did not exhibit anti-cholinesterase activity.
A perusal of logP (Table
The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely associated with COX-2.
We studied our compounds in vitro.
No activity was observed by the tested curcumin analogues.
Among the cinnamic acids, caffeic acid presented anti-COX-2 activity.
Within the hybrids, only 3e showed 19% inhibition (Table
Considering our results, the above LOX and COX-2 inhibitors are thought to protect against the inflammatory reactions that are known to be present in the neurons of patients with AD.
A large amount of positive data have been reported on the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of AD in the literature
The recorded antioxidant effects and AChE inhibition can improve existing cognitive functions and prevent current symptoms from worsening.
A potential anti-AD treatment may be developed based on the multi-functional activity of the tested compounds.
It seems that these curcumin analogues interacted with Soybean Lipoxygenase SLOX in the same way with an allosteric binding mode.
There was a superposition between the cyclopenta-1-one, tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one, and piperidine-4-thione central rings and their 2-napthyl and benzyl substituents (Figure
Docking scores were: 1k: -11.1; 1l: -9.4; 1m: 12; and 1o: -8.9 kcal/mol.

Computational Studies-Docking Simulation Soybean Lipoxygenase

Molecular Modeling of the Synthesized Derivatives in Soybean LOX
The synthesized derivatives were subjected to in silico studies.
The favored docking position of compound 3e is shown in Figure
Docking scores were based on algorithms and scoring function calculations, so a one-to-one correlation is difficult to be reached, whereas biological results from the in vitro inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase represent experimental values.
Docking results describe the ligand binding mode to the protein and their interactions.
It seems that the novel compounds interacted with the SLOX through allosteric interactions.
Compound 3e seemed to develop hydrophobic interactions with amino acids VAL126, VAL520, TYR525, PRO530, ARG533, VAL762, and ASP768 and π-cation interactions with LYS526.
From the literature, it is known that LOX inhibitors act as antioxidants by scavenging free radicals
Based on this fact, it can be concluded that compound 3e probably blocks the substrate to the binding site since it extends into the hydrophobic domain, thus preventing oxidation.

Molecular Docking Studies of the novel derivatives on AChE
AChE from Electrophorus electricus was selected for the biological assay due to its homology to human AChE.
Running an alignment through UniProt with the Clustal Omega program of the AChE from E. electricus showed a 60.4% identity, a 74.2% positive, a 633 query length, and a 614 match length with AChE from Homo sapiens
Molecular docking was performed for all the novel derivatives to the four optimized complexes derived from the alignment of the I-TASSER-generated 3D-model of AChE with experimental 3D-protein structures from the PDB (4BDT.A, 4EY5.A, 4EY6.A, and 4EY7.A) and subsequent minimization.
Compound 3e presented a docking score of -12.6kcal/mol to the optimized complex 4EY6.
Compound 3e exhibited a) hydrophobic interactions with amino acids TRP85, TYR123, TYR332, PHE333, and TYR336 and b) π-stacking interactions with TRP85, TRP281, and TYR336 (Figure

Biological In Vitro Assays
The in vitro assays were performed at a concentration of 100 µM (a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO was used, from which several dilutions were made for the determination of IC 50 values), at least in triplicate, and the standard deviation of absorbance was less than 10% of the mean.
The compounds were diluted in 0.1% DMSO under sonification in an appropriate buffer in several dilutions (Table
Statistical comparisons were made using the Student T-test.
A statistically significant difference was defined as p < 0.05.

Inhibition of Linoleic Acid Peroxidation
In vitro study was evaluated as reported previously by our group
Ten microliters of the 16 mM sodium linoleate solution were added to the UV cuvette containing 0.93 mL of a 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, prethermostated at 37 • C. The oxidation reaction was initiated at 37 • C under air by the addition of 50 µL of a 40 mM AAPH solution, which was used as a free radical initiator.
Oxidation was carried out in the presence of aliquots (10 µL) in the assay without antioxidants and monitored at 234 nm.
Lipid oxidation was recorded in the presence of the same level of DMSO and served as a negative control.
Trolox was used as the appropriate standard (positive control).

Soybean Lipoxygenase Inhibition Study
The in vitro study was evaluated as reported previously by our group
The tested compounds were incubated at room temperature with sodium linoleate (0.1 mM) and 0.2 mL of enzyme solution (1/9 × 104 w/v in saline).
The method was based on the conversion of sodium linoleate to 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid at 234 nm.
Nor-dihydroguaeretic acid NDGA (IC 50 = 0.45 µM) was used as a standard (positive control) (Table
In order to determine the IC 50 values, different concentrations were used.
A blank determination was used first to serve as a negative control.
The results are given in Table

AChE Inhibition Study
The in vitro study was evaluated as reported previously by our group.
A modified Ellman procedure was followed
The assay was performed in a pH 8 phosphate buffer (0.1 M) and used the thiol ester acetylthioline (0.01 M), which was hydrolyzed by AChE (3.5 U/mL) to produce thiocholine and acetate.
The thiocholine reduced DTNB (0.01 M in phosphate 0.1 M pH 7), thus liberating nitrobenzoate, which absorbed at 412 nm.
A blank determination was used first to serve as a negative control.
As a standard inhibitor, tacrine (positive control) was used.

Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibition Study
The in vitro study of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity
The reaction mixture (1 mL) contained 0.75 mM heme, 128 mM TMPD, 80 mM AA, and 1.5 mg enzyme in 0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.5).
The oxidation of the substrate was measured at room temperature by monitoring the increase of absorbance at 611 nm.
The absorption due to the spontaneous oxidation of TMPD was subtracted from the initial rate of oxidation observed in the presence of AA.
The inhibition of the compounds was determined after preincubation for 6 min with the enzyme in the presence of heme and TMPD, and the reaction was started by adding AA.
A blank determination was used first to serve as a negative control.
Indomethacin was used as a reference COX-2 inhibitor (positive control) (Table

Computational Methods.

Molecular Docking Studies on Soybean Lipoxygenase
UCSF Chimera was used for the visualization of the protein (PDB code: 3PZW)
Water molecules were removed, missing residues were added with Modeller
Open Babel was used to generate and minimize ligand 3D coordinates using the MMFF94 force field
Ligand topologies and parameters were generated by ACPYPE (AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE)
Energy minimizations were carried out using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field with GROMACS 4.6.
Docking was performed with AutoDock Vina (1.1.2)
The generation of docking input files and the analysis of the docking results were accomplished with UCSF-Chimera.
Docking was carried out with an exhaustiveness value of 10 and a maximum output of 20 docking modes.

Molecular Docking Studies on AChE
Until today, there had been no experimental 3D-structure of Electrophorus electricus AChE in the Protein Data Bank.
The UniProt entry for E. electricus AChE is O42275
Using the amino acids sequence annotated in UniProt, a 3D-model was generated with I-TASSER
The UCSF Chimera MatchMaker procedure was used for aligning the generated 3D-model of AChE with the following 3D-protein structures from the PDB-4BDT.A, 4EY5.A, 4EY6.A, and 4EY7.A, all of which contained active ligands used as drugs and minimized the necessity to consider protein flexibility
The aligned PDB structures were scripted out of the protein part, and the ligands were maintained.
Therefore, four new complexes were obtained from the Electrophorus electricus 3D-AChE with X-ray co-crystallized ligands: 4BDT:HUW, 4EY5:HUP, 4EY6:GNT, and 4EY7:E20.
Finally, these four new complexes were geometrically optimized by minimization using UCSF-Chimera with the AMBER14SB force website field
TIP3P
Ligand topologies and parameters were generated with AnteChamber
The 4 optimized complexes were used for the cross-docking simulations.
Docking simulations were run with a Vinardo scoring function
Docking was carried out using a grid box of size 25 Å in the X, Y, and Z dimensions and with an exhaustiveness value of 64 and a maximum output of 20 docking modes.
Docking results analysis and visual inspection were carried out using UCFS Chimera.
All ligands were docked to the 4 optimized complexes.
The best docked pose was selected by considering the docking score.
The CypRules server predicted the metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYPs) inhibition, including that of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and the results were based on the C5.0 algorithm.
The rules were calculated on a basis of Mold2 2D descriptors.

Conclusions
The designed and synthesized curcumin analogues and hybrids of cinnamic acids presented multi-target activity against different targets.
Hybrid 3e (Figure
This hybrid will be used as a lead compound for further theoretical structural modifications.
Hybrid 3a also presented a promising pleiotropic profile.
Docking studies on SLOX showed hydrophobic interactions with the amino acids, whereas docking studies on AChE exhibited hydrophobic interactions and π-stacking interactions.
All hybrids could be easily transported, diffused, and absorbed through the BBB, thus presenting good oral bioavailability.
No inhibition for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 was noticed.
According to the Ames test, all the hybrids induced mutagenicity, with the exception of 3d.
Further investigation is in progress to delineate the role of these hybrids on inflammation and Alzheimer's disease.
