Genetic and regulatory architecture of Alzheimer's disease in the <i>APOE</i> region
Introduction: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 2 and 4 alleles encoded by rs7412 and rs429358 polymorphisms, respectively, are landmark contra and pro "risk" factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Methods: We examined differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures between (1) AD-affected and unaffected subjects and (2) older AD-unaffected and younger subjects in the 19q13.3
region harboring rs7412 and rs429358.
Results: AD is associated with sex-nonspecific heterogeneous patterns of decreased and increased LD of rs7412 and rs429358, respectively, with other polymorphisms from five genes in this region in AD-affected subjects.
The LD patterns in older ADunaffected subjects resembled those in younger individuals.
Polarization of the 4and 2 allele-related heterogeneous LD clusters differentiated cell types and implicated specific tissues in AD pathogenesis.
Discussion: Protection and predisposition to AD is characterized by an interplay of rs7412 and rs429358, with multiple polymorphisms in the 19q13.3
region in a tissuespecific manner, which is not driven by common evolutionary forces.
framework of evolutionary biology, age-related traits are viewed as the results of indirect mechanisms such as co-evolution with fast-evolving pathogens, mismatch with environments, reproductive success at the expense of health, and so on,
Following the framework of evolutionary biology, we examined the molecular signatures of AD in the APOE region, represented by 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from five genes (BCAM, NECTIN2, TOMM40, APOE, and APOC1), as differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in mega-samples of 2673 AD-affected and 16,246 ADunaffected subjects of European ancestry.
We emphasized protective and detrimental heterogeneous signatures involving the APOE 2 and 4 alleles, encoded by rs7412 and rs429358, respectively.
We show that susceptibility to AD is the result of a complex interplay of these SNPs with SNPs from other genes in the APOE region, which is not driven by common evolutionary forces characteristic for the general (AD-unaffected) population.

METHODS

Data availability
This article was prepared using limited access data sets obtained though dbGaP (accession numbers phs000007.v28.p10,
phs000287.v5.p1, phs000428.v1.p1, and phs000168.v2.p2) and the University of Michigan.
Phenotypic Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data are available publicly and through restricted access from

Study cohorts and phenotypes
We used data from five studies.
Data for older individuals were drawn from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) original (FHS_C1) and offspring (FHS_C2) cohorts,
Data from the FHS third-generation cohort (FHS_C3) and
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort (Table

Genotypes
Genotyping was performed using the same customized Illumina iSelect array (the IBC-chip, ‚âà50 K SNPs) in the FHS and CHS cohorts, Thirty-two SNPs representing the BCAM-NECTIN2-TOMM40-APOE-APOC1 locus (Table
We excluded individuals with >5% missingness.
For cross-platform comparisons, we selected directly genotyped target SNPs or their proxies (r 2 > 0.8 in the 1000 Genomes Project, CEU population) using all available arrays for each study.
Non-genotyped SNPs were imputed (IMPUTE2
Retaining SNPs with high imputation quality (info > 0.8), rs11668536 in FHS/FHSO (info < 0.66) was excluded (details in Table

Statistical analysis
Associations between AD and each selected SNP were evaluated using an additive genetic model, with the minor allele as an effect allele.
Given limited information on AD age at onset in the LOADFS, the associations in this study were characterized using a logistic model with AD as a binary outcome and random effects to adjust for potential familial clustering (gee package in R).
Associations in the other studies were whether the DNA samples had been subject to whole-genome amplification; and (HRS) HRS cohorts.
Meta-statistics were evaluated using METAL.

Linkage disequilibrium analysis
We have used methods detailed in Ref. 19.
In brief, LD was characterized by the correlation coefficient r using haplotype-based and genotype-based methods.
Differences in their LD estimates indicate deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).
This information is important because HWE in the entire sample does not guarantee HWE in subsamples and/or at the haplotype level (see below), and thus, the observed deviation from HWE may be biologically plausible.
Significance of the LD estimates was characterized using chi-square statistics, defined as  2 = r 2 N, where N = 2n is the number of gametes and n is the sample size.
Given the potential loss of power because of inferring haplotypes from genotypes, we used a more conservative estimate, with n instead of N. We employed an LD contrast test
This test was used to characterize the significance of the differences in pairwise estimates of LD between these two groups.
Significance of the r 2 estimates and the differences in the pairwise estimates of LD were corrected for multiple testing.
For the 32 SNPs examined, this represented 496 (=32 √ó 31/2) tests.
We adopted a conservative Bonferroni correction for significance, P ‚â§ 10 -4 , despite some correlation between these SNPs.
Asymptotically valid confidence intervals were constructed using asymptotic variance adapted from. 21

Functional annotation
Potential regulatory functions of the selected SNPs were annotated using the Ensembl genome browser (
Reg-ulomeDB (
and HaploReg (
Information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) was obtained from the GTEx (v7 release) portal (

RESULTS

Study overview
Molecular signatures of AD were examined as the difference of LD patterns in mega-samples of AD-affected and unaffected subjects of Caucasian ancestry, with men and women combined and separately pooled from four independent studies comprising five cohorts: LOADFS, HRS, CHS, FHS_C1, and FHS_C2 (Table
LD patterns were characterized by 32 non-proxy SNPs (defined as LD with r 2 < 0.8), representing the BCAM, NECTIN2, TOMM40, APOE, and APOC1 genes in the 19q13.3
region (Table
We examined the potential role of survival selection in the AD signatures by contrasting LD patterns between older AD-unaffected individuals from those five cohorts (who were at exponentially increased mortality risk) and younger individuals (who were at negligible mortality risk), enriched by subjects from two additional cohorts, FHS_C3 and CARDIA (Table
Unless explicitly stated, the results of LD analyses are presented using a haplotype-based method (details in Materials and Methods).
Of the examined 32 SNPs, the minor allele of rs429358 was asso-
The effect directions were consistent in all studies for rs429358, but not for rs7412.
The largest magnitude of effects for these SNPs was observed in LOADFS ( = 1.78,
P = 9.33 √ó 10 -97 for rs429358 and  = -1.50,
P = 2.77 √ó 10 -14 for rs7412) and the smallest in FHS_C1 ( = 0.51, P = 1.87 √ó 10 -3 for rs429358 and  = 0.10, P = 6.48 √ó 10 -1 for rs7412) (Figure

Molecular signature of Alzheimer's disease
We contrasted LD patterns of the entire APOE region between ADaffected and unaffected individuals (Table
The pattern of the difference represents a molecular signature of AD illustrated by a heat map for Œîr = r casesr non-cases (Figure
Our analysis identified 193 of 496 (=32 √ó 31/2) SNP pairs (38.9%)
with Œîr values significant at the Bonferroni-adjusted level: P ‚â§ P Bonf = 10 -4 .
For 33 additional SNP pairs, we observed suggestive significances:
Molecular signatures of AD estimated using the genotype-based method (Table
The genotype-based method provided 153 SNP pairs significant at P < P Bonf and 33 additional SNP pairs with suggestive significance (P Bonf < P < 10 -3 ).
For 149 SNP pairs, the estimates of Œîr were significant at P ‚â§ P Bonf in both the haplotype-and genotype-based methods.
Given that all SNPs in the large sample of non-cases were in HWE at P HW > 10 -3 , the discordant estimates of Œîr for 44 SNP pairs between these two methods indicated SNPs with a plausible biological role because the deviation from HWE occurs in cases (Table
Accordingly, important biologically plausible information can be missed using the genotype-based method alone.

The APOE ùú∫2 (rs7412) and ùú∫4 (rs429358) coding SNPs are parts of the molecular signature of AD
In non-cases, rs7412 and rs429358 SNPs were in significant LD between each other, r = 11.6%,
P = 7.95 √ó 10 -94 , and with most of the other SNPs (Table
The strongest LD for rs429358 was observed with rs2075650 (r = 70%, TOMM40) and rs12721046 (r = 69%, APOC1)
SNPs.
For rs7412, the strongest LD of r = 37% was with rs283813 (NECTIN2).
Rearrangement of LD between AD cases and non-cases was characterized by a significant increase in LD of rs429358 with 13 SNPs, including rs7412 (Figure
SNPs (Figure
Although the change in LD was somewhat larger for rs429358 with nearby SNPs from the TOMM40-APOE-APOC1 locus (Figure
LD of rs429358 and rs7412 SNPs changed in opposite directions with the same four SNPs (rs8106922, rs405509, rs440446, and rs439401) from the TOMM40-APOE-APOC1 locus.
LD for rs429358 and rs7412 with SNPs from the BCAM-NECTIN2 locus also changed in opposite directions but for non-overlapping SNPs.
Significant changes in LD between rs7412 and 8 SNPs as well as between rs429358 and 13 SNPs were not explained by LD between those 8 or 13 SNPs.
This is because LD between these 8 or 13 SNPs can be very small (Figure
The latter implies genetic heterogeneity.
The changes in LD between AD cases and non-cases observed for rs7412 and rs429358 in the mega sample of pooled studies were consistent in independent studies (Table
Consistency of changes in LD for other SNPs in independent studies was reported in Ref. 22.

Molecular signatures of AD in men and women
We evaluated LD structure for the selected 32 SNPs in AD-affected and unaffected men and women separately (Table
The 95% confidence intervals for Œîr in men and women well overlapped for all SNP pairs, implying no significant difference in Œîr between these sexes.

LD patterns in younger and older individuals
We examined the role of survival selection in the molecular signature of AD by contrasting LD patterns in older subjects with no AD who were 55 years and older at biospecimen collection (N = 14,803), and younger subjects who were <55 years at biospecimen collection (N = 6565).
We excluded four SNPs from this analysis (rs7026, rs4803760, rs440277, and rs11667640) because they were imputed for most subjects (95.4%) from the young group.
The 55-year cutoff was used to separate younger individuals who were under negligible mortality risk in modern developed countries from those who were under exponentially increasing mortality risk.
This choice allowed consideration of LD patterns in the younger group as a proxy for the evolutionary selected LD structure in the APOE genomic region.
This analysis did not identify significant differences in LD patterns between these two groups.
At the level of individual SNP pairs, only two pairs in the BCAM-NECTIN2 locus exhibited significant differences (Œîr yo = r youmgr old at P ‚â§ P Bonf = 10 -4 ) in these large samples (Table
No significant differences were identified in the TOMM40-APOE-APOC1 locus (Figure

Regulatory architecture in the APOE region across cell types and tissues
Using data from Ensembl, 10 of 32 SNPs were identified as regulatory variants in active expression states in a variety of tissues
For seven of them, RegulomeDB assigned functionality scores of 1b to 2a corresponding to strong regulatory potential (Table
Most SNPs may affect transcription factor (TF) binding ability.
Altered motifs for TFs were identified for 28 SNPs in HaploReg (Table
The protein motifs at these sites are for known TFs that could contribute to the complex regulation of genes in this region.
HaploReg showed that 10 SNPs could affect the binding of various proteins (from one to seven), suggesting that they could be in actively transcribed regions.
Five more SNPs affected protein binding according to RegulomeDB (Table
Twentysix SNPs acted as eQTLs for the nearby protein-coding genes, according to GTEx, affecting expression in a number of tissues (Table
The APOE 4 allele-related LD cluster (Figure
We found that all five regulatory variants shared the same feature, exhibiting the active state in M0 and M1 macrophages from venous blood.
Four of them were active (rs440277, rs4081918, and rs157580) or poised (rs440446) in CD14+ monocytes (

DISCUSSION
Unlike few small-scale prior studies examining associations of LD patterns with AD,
This signature is represented by the pattern of differences in LD structures between AD-affected and unaffected subjects (Figure
The AD signature is consistent with a haplotype rather than a single allele origin of AD.
No significant differences between the AD signatures in men and women were identified.
Our results show that rs429358 in AD-unaffected subjects was likely evolutionary selected, whereas that in AD-affected subjects was not driven by the same evolutionary forces.
This result offsets potential age-related bias and is consistent with the uniquely human origin of AD, which is sensitive to the modern environment.
More detailed analyses are required to better understand driving force of the AD signatures, for example, whether they are the result of AD-related selection within a given human generation, AD-related selection across recent generations within families or communities, or AD-related divergence of ancestral groups.
Our bioinformatics analysis identified regulatory variants from the APOE 4and 2 allele-related LD clusters (Figure
A hallmark for regulatory variants from the 4-allele LD cluster was an active state in primary macrophages (M0) and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and active or poised expression states in CD14+ monocytes and NHAs.
Monocytes that originate in the bone marrow can differentiate into specific tissue macrophages and dendritic cells in response to inflammation/infection. Blood monocyte-derived macrophages, representing innate immunity, can contribute to the immune response in the central nervous system (CNS) along with brain-resident macrophages (microglia).
A pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage response causes neurotoxicity.
Enrichment in these specific immune cells is consistent with the role of peripheral monocytes/macrophages, along with microglia, in A clearance and a potential role in AD.
Given crosstalk between macrophages/microglia and astrocytes, they show neurotoxic or neuroprotective phenotypes.
M1 macrophages particularly induce astrocyte proliferation and a reactive phenotype.
The interaction between macrophages and astrocytes plays an important role in the increasing inflammatory response leading to neurodegeneration.
trocytes are implicated in the induction of neuroinflammation and AD, and apoE-mediated A clearance, which may be impaired by the reactive phenotype.
Stressed, dysfunctional astrocytes are connected with 4-associated AD.
This suggests that the 4 allele LD cluster is the result of rebalancing of neuroinflammatory tolerance mediated by astrocytes and macrophages in an exposure-dependent manner.
A common feature of regulatory variants in the 2 allelerelated LD cluster is having an active or poised state in NHLFs.
Lung fibroblasts play a role in airway inflammation and remodeling.
Pulmonary health is important in risk prevention of cognitive decline and dementia.
In addition, rs4803760 (intergenic NECTIN2-BCAM) and rs519113 (NECTIN2) are eQTLs for BCAM in lung.
The 4and 2-allele LD clusters have two common promoter variants (rs440446 and rs439401).
Of interest, rs439401 is located in the APOE-APOC1 intergenic region, which includes a specific macrophage, adipocyte, and astrocyte enhancer for the APOE gene,
PPAR is implicated in the regional transcriptional regulation of chr19q13.32
with the highest increase in expression observed for APOE messenger RNA (mRNA).
It plays a role in determining antiinflammatory macrophage (M2) phenotype,
us, polarization of the 4and 2-allele-related heterogeneous LD clusters differentiates cell types and implicates specific tissues in AD pathogenesis.
These clusters can be a result of alteration in functional properties of complex regulatory networks in specific cell/tissue types linked with activation and function of immune cells (ie, pro-
[M1] and anti-inflammatory [M2] macrophages) directed by the tissuespecific micro-environmental effects and other factors.
Specifically, the detrimental 4 allele LD cluster highlights the simultaneous effects of macrophage and astrocytes, whereas the protective 2 allele LD cluster is implicated in non-brain tissue.
Our results support the idea that the effect of even the strongest genetic risk factor of AD, the

and rs7412 are an inherent part of this signature.
This finding indicates that the role of the 4 and 2 alleles in AD is dependent on the other SNPs in this locus.
Indeed, decreased LD of rs7412 with eight SNPs in this locus in AD-affected subjects compared with unaffected subjects shows that the larger LD strengthens the protective effect because the large LD is observed in unaffected subjects.
Likewise, increased LD of rs429358 with 13 SNPs in AD-affected subjects shows that the larger LD strengthens the detrimental effect because the larger LD is observed in AD-affected subjects.
Complexity of the molecular signature of AD implies that other SNPs in this locus can indirectly modify the effects of the 4 and 2 alleles in AD pathogenesis.
Changes in the LD of the 4or 2 allele-coding SNPs with the other SNPs in a heterogeneous manner (Figure 3) indicate more homogeneous carrier groups of detrimental or protective polygenic variants.
This finding naturally strengthens a gene-based precision-medicine approach 31 to AD treatment and prevention.
The lack of the role of survival selection (Figure 4) in the AD signature implies that the LD pattern for the 32 SNPs
