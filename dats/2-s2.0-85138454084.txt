Association of COVID-19 with New-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease
An infectious etiology of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated for decades.
It remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.
In this retrospective cohort study of 6,245,282 older adults (age ≥65 years) who had medical encounters between 2/2020-5/2021, we show that people with COVID-19 were at significantly increased risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease within 360 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis (hazard ratio or HR:1.69, 95% CI: 1.53-1.72),
especially in people age ≥85 years and in women.
Our findings call for research to understand the underlying mechanisms and for continuous surveillance of long-term impacts of COVID-19 on Alzheimer's disease.

INTRODUCTION
An infectious etiology of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated for decades and despite supportive evidence, it is still controversial
The increased risk for COVID-19 in people with Alzheimer's disease
However, whether COVID-19 might trigger new-onset Alzheimer's disease or accelerate its emergence is unclear.

METHODS
We used the TriNetX Analytics Platform to access de-identified electronic health records of over 95 million patients of both inpatient and outpatient visits from 68 health care organizations, representing 28% of the US population from 50 states covering diverse geographic, age, race/ethnic, income, and insurance groups

TriNetX built-in analytic functions allow for patientlevel analyses, while only reporting population level data.
The MetroHealth System Cleveland Institutional Review Board determined research using TriNetX is not Human Subject Research and therefore exempt from Institutional Review Board review.
We have used TriNetX Analytics network platform in COVID-19 research
The study population comprised 6,245,282 older adults (age ≥65 years) who had medical encounters with healthcare organizations between 2/2/2020-5/30/2021 and had no prior diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
The population was divided into two cohorts: 1) COVID-19 cohort (n = 410,748)-contracted COVID-19 between 2/2/2020-5/30/2021; 2) non-COVID-19 cohort (n = 5,834,534)-had no documented COVID-19 but had medical encounters with healthcare organizations between 2/2/2020-5/30/2021.
The status of Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 were based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis codes and laboratory tests (details in the Supplementary Material).
We examined risks for new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts in all older adults, three age groups (65-74, 75-84, ≥85), and three racial/ethnic groups (Black, White, and Hispanic).
Cohorts were propensity-score matched (1:1 using a nearest neighbor greedy matching) for demographics, adverse socioeconomical determinants of health including problems with education, occupational exposure, physical, social and psychosocial environment, and known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease within 360 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis.
Cox's proportional hazards model was used to compare matched cohorts using hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
All statistical tests were conducted within the TriNetX

RESULTS

Patient characteristics
The study population comprised 6,245,282 older adults (age ≥65 years) including 410,748 in the COVID-19 cohort and 5,834,534 in the non-COVID-19 cohort.
The COVID-19 cohort did not differ in age nor gender from the non-COVID-19 cohort, but comprised more Hispanic and Black people and had higher prevalence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health and comorbidities.
After matching, the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts were balanced (Table

Increased risk of new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease among patients with COVID-19 compared to propensity-score matched patients without COVID-19
Before propensity-score matching the overall risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the COVID-19 cohort was 0.68%, compared to 0.35% in the non-COVID-19 cohort.
After propensity-score matching, COVID-19 cohort had increased risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease compared to matched non-COVID-19 cohort (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.53-1.72).
Increased risk was observed in populations stratified by age groups (65-74, 75-84, ≥85), gender (women, men), and race or ethnicity (Black, White, Hispanic), with highest risk in people age ≥85 years (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.73-2.07)
and in women (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.69-1.97)

DISCUSSION
Older adults with COVID-19 were at significantly increased risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with highest risk in people age ≥85 and in women.
Study limitations include potential biases introduced by the observational and retrospective nature of this study and inaccuracy in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, which should not substantially affect the relative risk analyses since all cohorts were drawn from the same dataset.
Next steps include validation from other data resources, longer-term follow-up, mechanism understanding and examining other types of dementia.
