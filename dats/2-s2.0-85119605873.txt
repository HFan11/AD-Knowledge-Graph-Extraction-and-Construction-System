Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of age-related dementia represents one of the most urgent healthcare challenges facing us today with numbers affected projected to increase ~50 million worldwide to 75 million by 2030 in line with an ageing global population.
AD results in a progressive loss of memory and decline in other cognitive functions due to the accumulation of pathological proteins including β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated-tau in neurons leading to massive loss of synapses.
Recent attempts to halt disease progression by targeting Aβ have largely failed
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a major neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and periphery where it is found at neuromuscular junctions and in preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
The "cholinergic hypothesis of AD" postulates that learning and memory deficits result from the loss of cholinergic innervation to the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus from nuclei in the basal forebrain which may be partially recovered by elevating acetylcholine levels, through the inhibition of the acetylcholine catabolising cholinesterases
Restoration of defective cholinergic transmission via inhibition of the cholinesterases is the primary symptomatic treatment for cognitive deficits associated with AD
Despite showing some efficacy, principally in the early stages of disease, cholinesterase therapies show significant dose-related adverse responses, particularly gastrointestinal, that limit clinical use
Receptors for ACh include the ionotropic nicotinic nAChR ion channels and the G protein-coupled (GPCR) muscarinic receptors.
The M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1-receptor), one of five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5) which, based on its high expression in areas such as the hippocampus and cortex
This has led many pharmaceutical companies to pursue drug discovery programs targeting the M1-receptor
A number of orthosteric muscarinic agonists, that utilise the binding site of the natural ligand acetylcholine, have advanced to the clinic
These include the M1/M4 preferring agonist xanomeline that improved both cognitive and behavioural disturbances in AD patients
Both programs were subsequently terminated based on cholinergic-adverse responses, predominantly within gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems.
The challenge then was to design muscarinic agonists with a pharmacological profile that would activate receptors in the CNS in areas such as the cortex and hippocampus involved in learning and memory whilst avoiding side effects particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular that would be unacceptable in a drug for elderly patients.
Attempts to map compound pharmacology to physiological activity has proved exceedingly difficult.
This is hampered by the lack of selectivity across muscarinic subtypes of both agonist and antagonists that have been used in clinical evaluation.
Expression profiling is limited to measuring mRNA due to the absence of selective antibodies to measure protein expression.
Muscarinic knockout mice
In addition, the clinical use of M2 and M3 antagonists in a range of gastrointestinal, urinary and lung disorders highlights the importance of selectivity versus other highly homologous muscarinic receptor subtypes.
An obvious approach would be to design an M1-agonist with high selectivity over M2-and M3-receptors.
However, in the case of muscarinic receptors this is very difficult due to the high sequence similarity of the orthosteric binding site across all five receptor subtypes
Furthermore, it was possible that some of the observed side effects might be mediated through the M1-receptor itself
Since the highest level of M1-receptor expression is in the cortex and hippocampus we hypothesized that a partial agonist of the receptor could be an additional strategy to provide the desired CNS activation whilst reducing potential on target M1-mediated effects in the periphery.
Finally, biased agonism has been a strategy employed for other GPCRs that can improve the therapeutic index of agonists through selective activation of downstream pathways
Here we describe the strategy taken to use structure based drug design (SBDD)
As a final translational step prior to progressing to evaluation in patients with AD, the pharmacology was evaluated in early clinical studies designed to study the safety profile at doses that could produce evidence of functional target engagement in the CNS of healthy volunteers.
Hence, our study demonstrates successful application of a SBDD approach applied to an attractive but highly challenging GPCR target.
The outcome of this work, HTL936, reveals that selective M1-receptor partial agonists can be safely progressed into clinical development and provides a template for future generations of M1-receptor agonists to deliver novel symptomatic treatments for cognitive deficits in AD.

Results

Screening fragment-like compounds as starting points for drug design
To initiate hit finding, homology models of the human M1-receptor bound to the agonist 77-LH-28-1 were derived based on the crystal structure of the avian β1-adrenergic receptor:cyanopindolol (PDB; 2VT4) complex
In this model (Figure
To support hit identification a targeted library of fragment-like compounds was assembled based on compounds that were predicted to interact with the M1-receptor.
The aim was to enrich for known chemotypes incorporating novel exemplars of privileged ring systems and functional groups that were observed across different classes of muscarinic agonist ligands
A resulting set of 322 commercially available fragment-like molecules were identified and tested in an in vitro functional extracellular regulated protein kinase-1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) and calcium mobilisation assays (Figure
Sixteen compounds exhibited activity, the top four of which were prioritised for further pharmacological characterisation and medicinal chemistry optimisation (Supplementary Table
Of these four hits the bis-piperidine primary amide, Compound 4, demonstrated an EC50 of 3.5µM at the M1-receptor and was considered an attractive starting point for further optimisation.

High resolution structures of the agonist-bound M1-receptor
To accelerate SBDD we sought to generate a high-resolution crystal structure of the M1-receptor in an agonist-bound conformation.
To facilitate structure determination a thermostabilised receptor construct (termed M1-StaR)
The M1-StaR contained twelve amino acid substitutions (Figure
With the exception of W101A 3.28 none of the other eleven amino acid substitutions were predicted to directly influence the acetylcholine binding site (Figure
To further aid crystallisation the first 19 residues and last 22 residues of the N-and C-termini, were removed and residues R220-F355 in the third intracellular loop were replaced with T4-lysozyme (T4L) (Figure
Consistent with an agonist-like conformation the M1-StaR-T4L had high agonist (77-LH-28-1)
binding affinity whilst showing a significant reduction in antagonist (NMS) affinity compared to wild type receptor (Supplementary Table
The M1-StaR-T4L was subsequently crystallised bound to 77-LH-28-1 in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) and the structure determined to 2.17 Å resolution (Figure
In this structure, 77-LH-28-1 is very well defined in the electron density map and is primarily held in place via the charge-charge interaction from the protonated nitrogen within the piperidine fragment at the centre of the ligand, to the negatively charged aspartate (D105 3.32 ) side chain (Figure
This piperidine ring system breaks apart the "tyrosine cage" seen in subsequently published muscarinic antagonist structures
Towards the apical side of the receptor, the tetrahydroquinoline-2-one moiety of the ligand makes hydrophobic contacts with W91 23.50 , L102 3.29 , Y85 2.64 , Y82 2.61 as well as with the disulphide bridge between cysteine residues C98 3.25 -C178 45.50 thereby linking transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) extracellular loop 2 (ECL2).
The tetrahydroquinoline-2-one oxygen further makes a water mediated hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Y82 2.61 .
The lower part of the 77-LH-28-1, encompassing the piperidine ring and the aliphatic tail, is sheathed within an elongated cavity, delineated by water molecules which are stabilised by an intricate hydrogen-bonding network, and by Y106 3.33 , Y408 7.43 , W157 4.57 , Y404 7.39 , all of which make Van der Waals contacts with the ligand.
This structure thus provided important initial co-ordinates to support M1-receptor SBDD.

Structure-based drug design of a lead M1-receptor agonist -HTL936
Confident in the agonist bound structure the key challenge we initially sought to address within the hit series was early evidence for M1-receptor selectivity against the highly homologous M2-and M3-receptors.
A series of molecules were synthesised to investigate the structural activity relationship (SAR) among which were a series of small amides including the iso-butyl amide, Compound 5 (Figure
Analysis of the docked structure of Compound 5 predicted that the shape of the ring system attached to the ethyl carbamate and subsequent structural re-arrangements of the 'tyrosine cage' would confer improved selectivity over M2-and M3-receptor subtypes.
This was confirmed by the introduction of an azepine ring which filled a sub-pocket of the orthosteric site defined between Tyr106 3.33 , Trp378 6.48 , Tyr381 6.51 and Cys407 7.42 in a more efficient manner to give racemic Compound 6 (Figure
This formed a critical breakthrough in the development of selective M1-receptor agonists.
Further investigation of the structural activity relationships of the amide group determined that lipophilic secondary amides were preferred (e.g.
Compounds 14 -18;
the extracellular vestibule (Y85 2.64 , W91 23.50 , C178 45.50 , I180 45.52 ).
We found that like 77-LH-28-1, HTL936 was primarily held in place via the charge-charge interaction from the protonated nitrogen to the negatively charged aspartate, D105 3.32 in the amine pocket (Figure
HTL936 demonstrates a similar re-arrangement of the tyrosine cage to 77-LH-28-1 with nitrogen of the piperidine ring making contact with Y404 7.39 causing a rotation that confers a unique conformation of another tyrosine within the cage, Y381 6.51 (Figure
The base of the amine pocket is formed by C407 7.42 , making hydrophobic contacts to the homopiperidine ring, and W378 6.48 , which is forming an edge-to-face π-stacking arrangement with the delocalised π electrons of the carbamate system.
GSK1034702 is primarily held in place via a similar interaction with the negatively charged aspartate D105 3.32 (Figure
However, a number of notable differences were observed in the binding mode of GSK1034702 compared to 77-LH-28-1 and HTL936 which despite the identical amino acid sequences between the muscarinic subtypes in the orthosteric site can rationalise the reduced selectivity versus M2-receptor agonism.
Most notably the reduced size of the tetrahydropyran fragment at the base of the ligand enables direct contact with Y106 3.33 that in turn is associated with displacement of W157 4.57 , W378 6.48 and Y404 7.39 thereby forcing a distinct orientation in this region of the binding pocket from that seen in the structures with 77-LH-28-1 and HTL936.
In addition, at the top of the minor binding pocket the larger 7-fluoro-5-methyl-benzimidazol-2-one portion of GSK1034702 occupies the whole of the region vacated by the W101 3.28 A (W101A) mutation in the M1-StaR.
Comparative MD simulations were performed to provide complementary insights into the flexibility of M1-ligand binding mode conformations and the stability of water mediated polar interaction networks (Figure
HTL936 forms stable water-mediated polar interaction networks in the major pocket with Y106 3.33 , T196 5.46 , Y381 6.51 and N382 6.52 via its carbamate moiety, and in the minor pocket and extracellular vestibule with C178 45.50 and Y404 7.39 via its amide group.
Similarly, GSK1034702 forms stable water-mediated polar interaction networks with its tetrahydro-2H-puran moiety and Y106 3.33 and T196 5.46 , and between its benzimidazol-2-one group and Y82 2.61 , I180 45.52 and Y381 6.51 .
In contrast, the water-mediated polar interaction between 77-LH-28-1 and Y82

In vitro pharmacological and signalling characterisation of HTL936
In vitro profiling in CHO cells overexpressing human M1-receptor confirmed the agonist activity of HTL936 in pERK1/2 (EC50 32nM), label-free dynamic mass redistribution (EC50 79nM) and inositol phosphate (IP1) assay formats (EC50 631nM;
Figure
Importantly, HTL936 demonstrated no detectable agonism at human M2-, M3-or M5-receptors although partial agonist activity was observed at the human M4-receptor (Table
HTL936 was further confirmed to demonstrate similar pharmacological activity across human, dog, rat and monkey M1-receptors (Table
Equilibrium radioligand binding studies using the antagonist [ 3 H]-NMS demonstrated that like acetylcholine, HTL936 had weak affinity for the human M1 (pKi= 4.7 ± 0.03, n=4), M2 (pKi= 5.5 ± 0.3, n=6) and M4 (pKi=5.4,
n=1) receptors whilst there was no detectable binding to the M3-receptor.
The recombinant over expressed cells provide a sensitive assay for muscarinic agonism -however demonstrating agonist activity in native systems increases confidence in achieving the desired pharmacological profile.
This is particularly important in the case of partial agonists.
In membranes prepared from the cortex of wild-type mice HTL936 stimulated a robust increase in Gq/11 protein-coupling (EC50 = 2.5µM, Emax 76% of the oxotremorine-M response (n=3)), which was absent in membranes prepared from M1-receptor KO animals (Figure
Electrophysiological recordings in rat hippocampal slices established that HTL936 increased the intrinsic excitability and spontaneous firing rates of CA1 pyramidal cells with a EC50 = 1.6µM (Figure
These findings were corroborated using in vivo electrophysiological recordings in adult rats where HTL936 caused a concentration-dependent increase in neuronal firing rate (Figure
Whilst HTL936 was observed to behave as a full agonist at the human M1-receptor in both pERK1/2 and DMR recombinant assay formats (Table
To determine the degree of intrinsic efficacy of HTL936 relative to acetylcholine we used the receptor-alkylating agent, phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) to irreversibly reduce M1-receptor levels in the cell line recombinantly overexpressing the human M1-receptor.
Inactivation of M1receptors with PBZ resulted in a reduction of both potency and maximal responses with HTL936 more sensitive than acetylcholine to these effects (Figure
Moreover, under equivalent conditions of receptor depletion, HTL936 behaved as a partial agonist in interaction assays with acetylcholine, eliciting a rightward shift in the IP1 acetylcholine concentration-response curve with increasing concentrations of HTL936
(Figure
Analysis of the data yielded Schild slopes approximating to unity (0.95 ± 0.08) and a pA2 value of 5.2 ± 0.11; that correlated with the pKi for HTL936 described in radio-ligand binding studies above.
We next assessed the potential of HTL936 to act as a biased ligand directing M1-receptor signalling toward one signalling pathway in preference to another
We determined the transduction co-efficient (t) for acetylcholine (the reference ligand) and HTL936 coupling the M1-receptor to Gq, G11, G15, the inositol phosphate (IP) pathway, pERK, arrestin recruitment to the plasma membrane and receptor-internalisation (Supplementary Figure
By determining the ratios of the transduction coefficients (DDlog(t/KA) (Kenakin and Christopoulos, 2013) we observe very little if any bias activity of HTL936 (DDlog(t/KA is <0.81 for all assays tested Supplementary Figure
These experiments also showed the partial agonism of HTL936 (Supplementary Figure
HTL936 was also found to be highly selective against a broad panel of 62 GPCRs (DiscoverX Neurological and Psychiatric panel) where at 10µM HTL936 exhibited <25% agonist at other receptors.

Evaluation of HTL936 in pre-clinical efficacy models
The in vivo pharmacology of HTL936 was examined across a range of efficacy models in mice, rats, dogs and non-human primates as described in the following sections.
Prior to testing in behavioural models HTL936 brain:plasma and brain:CSF ratios were measured in rats after intravenous (1 mg/kg) and oral (10 mg/kg) dosing and revealed significant distribution into the CNS (measured by total brain concentration and calculated unbound drug; Supplementary Table
The CNS distribution profile was confirmed in dogs where assessment of the distribution into the CSF after subcutaneous dosing demonstrated CSF:plasma ratios of 0.66, 0.6 and 0.65 at the 0.3, 1 and 2 mg/kg doses (Supplementary Table
A Kp,uu of ~0.2 was calculated in mice.
The calculated, or measured, plasma and brain exposures achieved in these studies and the approximate unbound drug levels as a ratio of the in vitro potency values determined for HTL936 are provided in the last column of Supplementary Table
Initial assessments of HTL936 in cognitive tasks focused on reversal of learning and memory deficits induced by the non-specific muscarinic antagonist scopolamine.
In a mouse model of fear conditioning involving associative learning and activation of hippocampal CA1, medial PFC and basolateral amygdala
Co-administration of HTL936 with scopolamine resulted in a dose-dependent restoration of learning and memory responses (Figure
Next, the effects of HTL936 were examined in a rat passive avoidance test, a spatial memory consolidation task dependent on intact entorhinal-hippocampal interactions
Treatment with scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p. 6 h post-training) induced a statistically significant amnesic effect that was reversed in a dose-dependent manner by HTL936 (Figure
The maximal response observed with HTL936 was equivalent to that obtained using the clinically approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (0.1 mg/kg; p.o) (Figure
In control experiments HTL936 demonstrated no difference in effect in open-field exploratory behaviour consistent with unaltered locomotor, anxiolytic and general behaviour of the animals (Figure
Learning and memory deficits in AD have been attributed to a loss of cholinergic transmission that are treated clinically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g.
donepezil)
Therefore, it was important to assess the potential effects of combining HTL936 with the current clinical standard of care, donepezil.
For these studies we employed a dose of donepezil (0.01 mg/kg) that was inactive in the rat passive avoidance model combined with a dose of HTL936 of 3mg/kg (estimated Cu,br = 79nM) that similarly gave no response alone (Figure
When combined HTL936/donepezil resulted in a significant partial reversal of scopolamine-induced deficits consistent with an additive-like effect between these compounds (Figure
In experiments not involving scopolamine, treatment with HTL936 improved working memory in the rat novel object recognition paradigm that reflects improved functioning of fronto-hippocampal and entorhinal circuits
The effective dose of HTL936 was 10 mg/kg (estimated Cu,br = 262nM) (Figure
Finally, compounds which stimulate CNS activity in particular dopaminergic function are associated with inceases in locomotor activity.
Such activity can compromise interpretation of cognitive measure.
HTL936 at doses up to 100mg/kg had no effect on locomotor activity was assessed either alone or in combination with amphetamine, there was no evidence of adverse effects of doses up to 100 mg/kg of.
This model is known to be sensitivie to the effects of M4-receptor agonists and therefore despite the evidence of M4 activity in the recombinant assays HTL936, at least in this model, did not appear to demonstrate evidence of M4-receptor agonist-like activity.

HTL936 reversed cognitive deficits in a mouse model of neurodegeneration
We next wanted to test the effects of HTL936 in the context of neurodegenerative disease.
Our previous studies have determined that murine prion disease is associated with disrupted hippocampal cholinergic innervation that results in learning and memory deficits that could be restored by donepezil and muscarinic ligands
Consistent with the notion that HTL936 can restore cholinergic tone in a manner that might be relevant in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in AD, we found that HTL936 significantly improved fear conditioning learning and memory in murine prion disease (Figure
In these studies, Tg37 hemizygous mice at 9 weeks post inoculation (w.p.i.) with Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) prions were treated with HTL936 (30 mg/kg; i.p.) 30 minutes prior to the training phase.
On reexposure to the training environment 24 h later, mice treated with HTL936 show significantly higher immobility levels (~34%) than mice receiving vehicle (~13%)
indicating that hippocampal-dependent contextual learning and memory processes in neurodegenerative mice were improved by acute administration of HTL936 in this disease model (Figure

HTL936 demonstrates cognitive benefits in aged beagles
Similar to clinical AD pathology, beagle dogs exhibit age-dependent cognitive decline, Aβ pathology and evidence of cholinergic hypofunction, suggesting that this may represent a valuable pre-clinical species with translational relevance for muscarinic agonists targeting cognitive decline
A delayed non-matching to position (DNMP) cognitive model was used to assess the effects of HTL936 on a visual-spatial working memory task in aged beagle dogs.
HTL936 was administered subcutaneously at 0.3, 1 and 2 mg/kg.
Bioanalysis of plasma and CSF at 4 h postdose confirmed plasma:CSF ratios were consistent with pre-clinical rodent assessment (measured Ccsf concentrations = 13, 48 and 128nM respectively; see Supplementary Table
Baseline DNMP performance was assessed daily for 5 days followed by daily dosing of HTL936 or vehicle for 10 days with DNMP assessment on 5 consecutive occasions.
Significant improvements in visual-spatial memory were seen after treatment with HTL936 at 0.3 mg/kg and 1mg/kg.
The effects at the 1 mg/kg dose of HTL936 were equivalent to that of donepezil (Figure

Translation of muscarinic receptor agonism to non-human primates
Rodent models are the mainstay of our attempts to understand mammalian brain function and as a tool for target validation and drug discovery.
However their ability to accurately predict human behaviour depends on translational understanding of target function in the context of the behaviour to be studied.
Non-human primates offer an intermediate species in which to explore pharmacology between rodents and human.
As a next step we therefore examined the CNS exposure and preliminary evidence for CNS target engagement in non-human primates.
We employed a basic quantitative EEG (qEEG) protocol to assess the effect of HTL936 on resting state network firing in non-human primates.
HTL936 was dosed subcutaneously to avoid complications associated with the low oral bioavailability in primates (predicted brain exposures of Cu,br = 20 and 198 nM for 0.3 and 3mg/kg respectively) and resulted in increased delta power (Figure
Delta oscillations have been linked with cognitive tasks
Evaluating the safety pharmacology of HTL936 -did the increased selectivity lead to an improved therapeutic margin in preclinical species?
Historically the presence of classic cholinergic side effects, including salivation, sweating, convulsion/seizures and gastrointestinal distress has resulted in doselimiting toxicology and clinical adverse events thought to be mediated in part by the non-selective activation of M2-and M3-receptors
As part of the safety evaluation necessary to support clinical development HTL936 was evaluated across a battery of CNS and cardiovascular (CV) safety studies.
Substantial literature highlights a potential role for the M1-receptor in proconvulsive/seizure-like behaviours
In a modified Irwin Functional Observation
Battery test used to assess potential behavioural adverse effects in rats, there were no observations of significance adverse responses including a complete absence of seizure-like effects on oral dosing up to 100 mg/kg (Cmax = 6400 ng/ml; Cu,pl = 11994 nM).
In total across the entire HTL936 program there was only one convulsivelike episode recorded following treatment with HTL936 in a 4-day repeat dose tolerability assessment in dogs.
In this animal the plasma Cmax was >32,000 ng/ml (Cu,pl = 59971 nM), significantly above the exposures predicted to be required for cognitive improvements.
The cardiovascular effects of HTL936 were initially tested in both telemetered rats and dogs.
In rats oral dosing of HTL936 at 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg resulted in a dosedependent increase in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure averaged over the 5 h post-dose period.
No significant effects were evident at the 3 mg/kg dose.
The effects of HTL936 at all doses were transient in nature returning to baseline as the predicted exposure of HTL936 declined.
A similar dose-dependent profile of HTL936 effects on blood pressure, but not heart rate, was seen in the dog GLP-compliant cardiovascular safety pharmacology telemetry study.
All hemodynamic changes returned to control levels within 30 min of the end of the i.v.
infusion (Table

Supplementary Information Figures SIa-d and Supplementary Information
Tables
Consistent with other recently published studies on M1-receptor ligands
Clinical signs attributable to M1receptor agonism such as excessive salivation, vomiting and lacrimation were observed in safety pharmacology and toxicology studies where the plasma exposure exceeded 157 ng/ml (Cu,pl = 283nM).
These observations were not evident in either rats or non-human primates with plasma exposure up to 732 and 557 ng/ml respectively (Cu,pl = 1372 and 991nM respectively) suggesting potential differences in species sensitivity to cholinergic adverse events.
In summary, HTL936 demonstrated significant benefits across a range of established and novel models used to assess cognition with limited evidence for cholinergic AEs that have been associated with some historical programs.
In order to help contextualise the safety pharmacology, and efficacy data the apparent therapeutic index (TI) was calculated by comparing the total plasma exposures between efficacy studies and the safety pharmacology/toxicology studies.
These data are summarised in Table

The profile of HTL936 in healthy human volunteers
HTL936 was progressed into a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, firsttime-in-human (FTIH) ascending single and multiple oral dose study in healthy young and elderly volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02291783; additional clinical data following IV administration of HTL936 will be described in detail in a subsequent publication -Footnote 1).
The single ascending dose (SAD) pharmacokinetics are summarised in Table
The concentration of CNS drugs in the CSF have been widely used as a surrogate for the unbound drug concentrations in the brain in order to assess the potential for drugs to access their pharmacological targets.
CSF drug levels were measured in 6 healthy male subjects after a single 54 mg oral dose of HTL936.
The maximum HTL936 concentration in CSF was reached between 2-3 h, which was delayed relative to the plasma tmax (approximately 0.5 h).
The mean ng/mL (±SD) ratio of CSF/plasma was 0.11±0.04,
0.30±0.05
and 0.39±0.08 at 1, 2 and 3 h post-dose respectively with the rising ratio over time due to the relative persistence of HTL936 in CSF compared with plasma.
Based on the AUC0-3h, the mean (±SD) CSF/plasma ratio was 21±3.4%.
These data are consistent with pre-clinical CNS distribution data where CSF levels were measured.
In the SAD study HTL936 between 1-100mg showed no serious adverse events that led to withdrawl (Supplementary Table
Mild responses consistent with cholinergic mechanisms (salivation, sweating and changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate) were recorded only in the 175mg cohort (3/5 subjects).
Only subjects with a Cmax of ≥ 242 ng/mL recorded evidence of cholinergic side effects, which increased in duration and severity with increasing exposure (see; Table
In the context of therapeutic margins the plasma drug concentrsation of 242 ng/ml is about 5x higher than the plasma minimal effective concentration in the aged beagle DNMP efficacy study (0.3 mg/kg dosed subcutaneously, Cmax plasma exposure 58 ng/ml).
Based on the measured CSF to plasma ratios of HTL936 from 1 to 3 h post-dose (11, 30 and 39 respective) the plasma Cmax of 242 ng/ml can be estimated to represent unbound brain exposures in the range of 72 to 259 nM.

CNS signal finding studies in human subjects
To understand whether HTL936 would have sufficient safety margins between peripheral adverse cholinergic effects and CNS activity associated with cognition it was helpful to identify a biomarker of CNS activity.
Quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) and Event Related Potentials (ERP) were included in the multiple dosing part of the study on day-1, day-4 and day-9 when HTL936 would be predicted to have reached steady state.
In a P300 active auditory oddball EEG paradigm, effects were found along frontal-parietal regions involved in generating attentional response and processing of stimuli.
The high exposure group showed significant within and between group effects for deviant amplitude for electrodes Fz and Cz on day 9, with consistent but smaller effects on day 4.
The deviant-standard results were consistent with the amplitude effects (Supplementary Table
The pharmacodynamic effects of HTL936 on hippocampal dependent spatial learning and memory and hippocampal activity were examined in a separate study in elderly subjects (aged 65-80 years; ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02546310).
The study was a single dose, double-blind placebo controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which 54 healthy elderly subjects were randomly allocated to either placebo (0.9% sodium chloride aq.
i.v.; n=18) or HTL936 (i.v.; n=36) treatment.
HTL936 was administered via i.v.
infusion in order to ensure control of HTL936 exposure at steady-state within closely defined limits during the fMRI assessment.
Two doses of HTL936 were employed in this study with the aim of safely exploring preliminary evidence that the drug was active within CNS regions relevant to cognition.
A low dose of 10.1 mg i.v.
(n=18) predicted to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations of 25 ng/ml and a high dose of 40.3 mg i.v.
predicted to achieve steadystate plasma concentration of 100 ng/ml.
Based on the measured human CSF to plasma ratios of HTL936 these plasma exposures were predicted to range from approximately 7 -30 nM and 30 -110 nM for the low and high doses respectively (0.2 -3.4 fold the human M1-receptor in vitro potency).
Learning and memory related hippocampal activity was assessed using the Arena task, which is extensively described elsewhere
Not unexpectedly HTL936 did not significantly improve task performance in this small number of healthy elderly subjects but did result in a significant drug by activation interaction effect in the left hippocampus during encoding of spatial cues, driven by increased activation under the 10.1 mg/kg dose, with the 40.3 mg/kg dose showing a smaller effect (F(1,30)=6.44, p=0.017 small volume corrected; Figure
The 10.1 mg/kg dose consistently showed increased bilateral activation across the a-priori defined regions of interest during both encoding and retrieval phases of the task (Figure
Taken together these studies provide evidence of CNS target engagement for HTL936 at concentrations with a safety profile suitable for further evaluation.

Discussion
The publication of the first non-opsin GPCR crystal structures
Here we present the rational structural-based design of a selective GPCR ligand with the expected in vitro and in vivo pharmacology that delivers preclinical efficacy in animal models and desirable animal and human toxicity that when tested in humans gave clinically relevant effects.
In this way we present a general roap-map for the application of SBDD in GPCR-drug discovery.
Specifically, our study demonstrates that it is possible to design a M1-receptor agonist with significantly reduced adverse effects that have thwarted previous attempts to target this receptor in AD, whilst maintaining positive effects on memory centres in humans.
Strategies to accurately quantify the ability of GPCR agonists to produce a response in a given cell system and to predict the response in the relevant disease tissue has been a deep problem in receptor pharmacology for many years
Agonist responses depend on the level of expression of the receptor, coupling to G proteins and the efficiency of engagement to the tissue, or organ, physiological response.
This means that using recombinant cells with over expressed levels of receptors and downstream signalling pathways that may not be relevant is frought with risk as a strategy for drug design.
The study of muscarinic receptor activity and its modulation by the first known agonist/antagonist pair of pilocarpine and atropine in the 1870s by John Langley led to the concept of receptors and the very foundation of modern day pharmacology
However even 150 years later we are still struggling to understand the contribution of different muscarinic receptors to human physiology let alone design drugs that can selectivitly modulate cholinergic systems.
There are five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5) of which the M1-receptor has long been considered an exciting opportunity for the treatment of cognitive disorders
However, despite extensive efforts this target has proved largely intractable from a drug development perspective due primarily to the inability to avoid cholinergic adverse responses often described as SLUDGE (salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal and emesis) resulting from activity at peripheral M3-and M2-receptor subtypes
The remedy has widely been thought to lie in making more selective M1-receptor ligands thereby avoiding detrimental off-target activity at other muscarinic subtypes
In addressing this challenge a starting point to understand M1-receptor pharmacology at the atomic level was the generation of multiple agonist-bound structures of the M1-receptor.
Comparison of the binding of the extended orthosteric agonists 77-LH-28-1, GSK1034702 and HTL936 provides support for a common proximal trigger of activation, involving disruption of the "tyrosine cage" seen previously in muscarinic-receptor antagonist structures
An appreciation of this allowed for the design of the size and orientation of the compound in this key activation region that acted to prevent the inward movement of Y104 3.33 , Y403 6.51 and Y426 7.39 seen in the M2-receptor iperoxo agonist structure
This change resulted in compounds with greatly reduced M2-and M3-receptor agonist activity but maintained nM activity at the M1-receptor.
Eliminating M2-and M3-receptor activity provided a clear rationale for the favourable safety profile of HTL936 relative to orthosteric agonists such as xanomeline
There may, however, be other factors in play that contribute to the safety profile of HTL936
and to other future M1-selective agonists.
Our data presented here together with recent genetic and pre-clinical pharmacological studies, have established that both SLUDGE adverse responses and centrally mediated seizure and convulsions can be mediated by previously unappreciated on-target activity at M1-receptors
However we did not see any evidence for centrally-mediated adverse effects in the dog such as seizures and convulsions despite achieving high plasma exposures of HTL936.
This is particularly encouraging since this species is well know to show increased sensitivity to cholinergic pharmacology and enhanced central and peripheral adverse responses to muscarinic ligands
Nevertheless the possibility that cholinergic-adverse responses might in part be mediated by peripheral and central M1-receptors would mean that building in M1receptor selectivity alone may not be sufficient to generate a well-tolerated drug suitable for treatment in elderly patients.
In addition to selectivity, consideration must be given to reducing unfavourable M1-mediated activity.
The reason for the more favourable safety profile of HTL936 may lie a recent appreciation of the importance of M1-receptor phosphorylation-dependent signalling as a means of protecting against centrally mediated cholinergic-adverse effects
This study reported that M1-ligand biased toward G protein signalling and away from receptor phosphorylation/arrestin signalling showed greater cholinergic adverse responses whilst an un-biased ligand was associated with reduced adverse effects
Here, our in vitro pharmacological characterisation of HTL936 revealed an un-biased signalling profile that, based on our previous studies
The data from the pre-clinical animal models and human studies presented here upholds this prediction.
In order to reduce potential M1-receptor related adverse effects, an additional important feature of HTL936 pharmacology is the partial agonist profile that likely contributes to low adverse events at clinically relevant concentrations.
It is well documented that partial agonists can exhibit variable efficacy profiles ranging from antagonists to full agonists depending on the level of receptor reserve within the tissue
Previous pre-clinical studies have highlighted that centrally expressed M1-receptors exhibit a high level of receptor reserve, with only stimulation of 15% of M1-receptors in the hippocampus and cortex required to achieve maximal efficacy
In support of this is, our clinical studies provided preliminary evidence of centrally mediated target engagement at relatively low unbound brain exposures (7 -30 nM following i.v.
administration).
This suggests that M1-partial agonists such as HTL936 can show sufficient efficacy to stimulate the wellcoupled post-synaptic M1-receptors in the CNS whilst the partial nature of agonism means that peripheral M1-receptors expressed at lower levels are poorly activated.
In this way the partial agonists maximise the potential therapeutic margin between centrally mediated effects and dose-limiting M1-driven peripheral effects.
Alternative approaches to those described here are currently being pursued to overcome the challenge of cholinergic-adverse responses in M1-receptor ligands.

In addition, the comparative analysis of M1
Recently the orthosteric agonist xanomeline has been combined with a peripheral nonselective muscarinic antagonist trospium
This approach resulted in a range of anticholinergic adverse effects associated with the use of trospium but in addition procholinergic effects of nausea and vomiting were observed transiently suggesting these may derive from engagement of central muscarinic receptors.
Another approach to selectively targeting the M1-receptor involves the identification of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that potentiate the action of endogenous acetylcholine
Although holding the promise of delivering M1-receptor activation with low adverse effects
HTL936 was shown to have efficacy both alone and in combination with donepezil in a range of models of cognition in rodents and dogs indicating that combination trails of HTL936 or related molecules with current standards of care should be feasible.
These studies are also consistent with the view that M1-agonists can enhance communication between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions, areas affected in AD and associated with progressive learning and memory deficits.
They further suggest a role in cognitive processes that are more heavily dependent on the prefrontal cortex, like executive function.
Our range of in vivo efficacy studies across different models confirm an efficacy profile with unbound brain exposures consistently around or below the measured in vitro potency in the same species.
In conclusion we have demonstrated how a combination of crystallographic approaches and step wise translational pharmacology across species can support the rational design of a selective orthosteric partial M1-agonist, HTL936.
This agent showed cognitive enhancing properties across a range of pre-clinical models and early evidence that muscarinic M1-agonists can be developed that provide a therapeutic window between desirable CNS activity and peripheral cholinergic adverse effects .
The studies reported here in the characterization of HT936 have increased our understanding of muscarinic pharmacology, the contribution of different receptors

Subjects enrolled in the multiple ascending dose study underwent EEG recording twice on a baseline day (Day -1) to match the "pre-dose" and "post-dose" (a time point corresponding to 2 hours after the pre-dose approximately at the time of the mean peak serum concentration of HTL936 after morning dose).
Assessments were performed according to the sequence qEEG, P50, Mismatch Negativity (MMN) and P300 active auditory oddball paradigm, starting with qEEG at 1.5 hours post-dose as first measure.
0.5 and 1 hour post infusion in sling) (additional recordings were continued to 12hours post-dose).
For each variable, the mean of the pre-dose values recorded for each animal on each dose were taken as the baseline for that dose and that animal.
The plasma concentrations of HTL936 was determined in these experiments (Table
Time given as minutes after the end of a 2hr intravenous infusion where 0 minutes indicates the end of the infusion period.
Blood samples of approximately 2 mL were taken from the jugular vein of each animal at the end of infusion and again at the end of the 1 hour post-infusion observation period in sling following administration of vehicle and HTL936.
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either (i) template or mutant receptor constructs using GeneJuice (Merck Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions and harvested after 48 h or (ii) with polyethylenimine (PEI), using a 1:6 weight to weight ratio of DNA to PEI. 24 h post transfection cells were detached and seeded into 96 well poly-D-lysine coated assay plates and cultured for an additional 24 h -48 h.

Screening strategy
The protein preparation and docking experiments were done within the Schroodinger Maestro package.
The grid generation necessary for docking was done within Glide.
The residues highlighted in SDM experiments (in-house and external) were used to further define the cavity of the grid.
However, no constraints were added in the grid generation to ensure that subsequent dockings were not biased in any way.
As standard, up to 3 poses per molecular structure were stored for analysis.
1.6 million fragment-like compounds were prepared for screening, and all or a subset from more stringent prefiltering and clustering were docked into each of the models using the SP algorithm within the Schrödinger Glide software, running on a 28 CPU Linux cluster.
The resultant hits from the virtual screen were then reduced further by applying distance and volume constraints to ensure that the bound poses were within the area highlighted by SDM to be important for agonism of the structure.
The more stringent subset was generated from a ligand-based scaffold hopping approach whereby common motifs within the known agonists, highlighted above, were used as a preselection filtering criterion to enrich the compound set for subsequent docking.

StaR generation
To alleviate toxicity associated with DNA propagation of WT M1 mAChR, a hybrid construct comprising residues 1-38 of M4 fused to residues 32-438 of M1 mAChR was used as the template for StaR generation.

Expression, membrane preparation and protein purification.
To facilitate crystallisation further modifications were made to the M1-StaR construct.
The flexible domains were removed from the N-terminus (residues 1-27) and Cterminus (residues 439-460) and T4-lysozyme (T4L) was inserted into intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) between residues 219 and 354.
These modifications did not alter the ligand binding properties of the receptor compared to wild-type M1 mAChR.
The construct further comprises an N-terminal GP64 signal sequence, and a C-terminal decahistidine tag.
The receptor was expressed using the Bac to Bac Expression System (Invitrogen) in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells using ESF 921 medium (Expression Systems) supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 % (v/v) Penicillin/Streptomycin (PAA Laboratories).

Arrestin assay
To assess arrestin recruitment to M1 a bystander BRET assay was employed
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding:
1. human β-Arrestin-2 fused at its N terminus to Nanoluciferase (Nluc); 2. the mNeonGreen (mNG) fluorescent protein fused at its C terminus with the prenylation CAAX sequence of KRas; and 3. a plasmid encoding human M1.
For these transfections a DNA weight ratio of 1:25:5 was used for the Nluc-β-Arrestin-2 : mNG-CAAX : M1-WT plasmids.
After transfection, cells were cultured 24h before 20,000 cells/well were transferred to white poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates and cultured a further 24h.
For the assay, the white 96-well plates were washed twice with HBSS and incubated for 30 min at 37°C.

GTPgS Assay
Wild-type or M1-KO mice
Tissue was suspended in ice-cold buffer A (containing 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2% (w/v) EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenised (4 x 5 sec bursts) using a Polytron homogeniser.
The suspension was centrifuged at 200 xg for 5 min at 4°C using an Eppendorf 5810R bench-top centrifuge.
Supernatants were collected and re-homogenised as above.
The suspension was subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 40,000 xg at 4°C using a Beckman Coulter Avanti JXN-26 centrifuge with a JA-25.25 rotor.
Supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 mL ice-cold buffer B (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4).
The pellet was homogenised, GTP (1 mM final) was added and the suspension was incubated at 37°C for 15 min.
The suspension was subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 40,000 xg at 4°C and the pellet was re-suspended in 15 mL ice-cold buffer C (10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and re-homogenised as before.
Suspension was centrifuged again for 20 min at 40,000 xg at 4°C.

Open field behaviour
During the rat passive avoidance testing, open field exploratory behvaviour was measured on study days 4 and 5 (acclimatisation and handling), 6 (training) and 7
(recall).
The openfield apparatus consisted of black-painted Perspex 620 mm 2 with walls 300 mm high.
Locomotor activity, measured as the distance travelled in a 300 second period, as well as incidences of rearing and grooming were recorded, using Ethovision XT tracking software (Noldus UK).

Fear conditioning
C57Bl/6J male mice (aged 8-12 weeks) were acclimatized to the behavioral testing

Prion-infection of mice
Tg37 hemizygous mice were inoculated by intracerebral injection into the right parietal lobe with 1% brain homogenate of RML prions aged 3 to 4 weeks as described previously
Control mice received 1% normal brain homogenate (NBH).
fast Fourier transform (FFT) was conducted on 4 s periods filtered by a sliding Hanning window with a 92.75% overlap to calculate power with a 0.25Hz frequency resolution.
For each frequency band, outliers were defined as the median +/-eight times the median absolute deviation over the window of interest (i.e. 2, 5 or 10 min), and removed from the subsequent analysis.
Frequency bands were defined as follows:
Delta: 1-4Hz, Theta: 4-8Hz, Alpha: 8-12Hz, Sigma: 12-16Hz, Beta: 16-24Hz, Low Gamma: 24-50Hz, High Gamma: 50-100Hz.
Mean absolute power, log transformed absolute powerand , relative power was calculated based on each frequency band's contribution to the total absolute power (i.e. % power).
The mean normalized power was subsequently calculated by dividing each frequency band's absolute power in the drug condition with the corresponding power in the control condition for each individual animal (i.e.
use each animal as its own control) and then average across subjects.
Data was analyzed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA to identify treatment effects within a frequency band for all parameters followed by Fisher's post-hoc tests when applicable to identify individual differences and significance defined as p ≤ 0.05.

Clinical EEG
Routine EEG was performed for all subjects during screening enrolled in the multiple The MMN protocol used twelve different frequencies ranging in 50 Hz steps from 700 to 1250 Hz delivered binaurally via special headphones or earphones.
All stimuli were presented with a constant SOA of 300 ms in a pseudo-randomised order assuming a frequency deviation of one train to another of at least 100 Hz with three different lengths/durations of series which occurred evenly.
For the P300 active auditory oddball paradigm sinusoidal tones of 90 dB SPL intensity and 50 ms duration were delivered binaurally in an inter-stimulus-interval of 1000 msec.
The standard stimulus, a low frequency tone (1000 Hz) appeared with a frequency of 85%.
The target stimulus (higher frequency tone of 2000 Hz) with a frequency of 15% was presented in a pseudo-randomised manner and in a way that it was never repeated immediately.
The participant was instructed to press a corresponding button as quickly as they can after they recognized the target stimulus (high tone).

-receptor crystal structures bound to partial agonist HTL936 and agonists 77-LH-28-1 and GSK1034702 provided new detailed insights into the unique structural features of partial agonism.
HTL936 has a more extended binding mode simultaneously targeting major and minor pockets.
This unique binding mode is stabilised by chemical moieties that were identified and optimised by iterative SBDD, including a piperidine-azepine ring system efficiently targeting the full amine pocket, a 3D shaped cyclobutylmethyl binding deep into the minor pocket and extracellular vestibule, and a carbamate moiety mediating an extended water mediated polar receptor-ligand interaction network in the major pocket.
These combined structural features of HTL936 provide a basis for the partial agonism of this novel M1-receptor modulator.

Protein chamber.
The smaller of the compartments measured 90 mm in width and contained a low-light (~200 lux) illumination source.
The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated.
The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart.
A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars.Animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus, immediately after which, spontaneous behaviour was assessed.
The timer was started once the animal completely turned to face the front of the chamber.
Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded, and having completely entered the dark compartment foot shock was administered to the animal, which immediately returned to the light compartment.
Animals were then returned to their home cages.
Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues.
Vehicle (saline) or scopolamine (1 mg/kg) was administered to rats 6 hours after training.
Recall of the inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hour posttraining on study day 7, by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 600 seconds was employed.
