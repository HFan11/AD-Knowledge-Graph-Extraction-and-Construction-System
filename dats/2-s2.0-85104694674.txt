HIGHLIGHTS
• Resting-state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) measures may reflect synchronization of cortical neurons in humans.
• Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show consistent abnormalities in rsEEG measures at both the group and individual level.
• Linear EEG measures may be used as neurophysiological markers in AD clinical trials.

ABSTRACT
The Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area (EPIA) and Global Brain Consortium endorsed recommendations on candidate EEG measures for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.
The Panel reviewed the field literature.
As most consistent findings, AD patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia showed abnormalities in peak frequency, power, and "interrelatedness" at posterior alpha
The following consensus statements were subscribed: (i) Standardization of instructions to patients, rsEEG recording methods, and selection of artifact-free rsEEG periods are needed; (ii) Power density and "interrelatedness" rsEEG measures (e.g., directed transfer function, phase lag index, linear lagged connectivity, etc.) at delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands may be use for stratification of AD patients and monitoring of disease progression and intervention; and (iii) International multisectoral initiatives are mandatory for regulatory purposes.
fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers
According to these diagnostic criteria, AD status is associated with (i) a reduction of cerebrospinal (CSF) A42 and an increase in amyloid at the brain level as revealed by amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) mapping, and
(ii) an increase of phospho-tau in CSF and of tau PET tracer retention.
Neurodegeneration over the course of disease progression may be revealed by 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET), total tau in CSF, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain atrophy in temporoparietal cortex and the medial temporal lobes (including the hippocampi).

Measures of eyes-closed resting state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms
The use of the above neuroimaging techniques for serial recordings in longitudinal AD clinical trials may be limited due to their high costs and invasiveness, especially in lower-and middle-income countries.
Apart from the indirect role played by FDG-PET as a marker of synaptic integrity, none of these biomarkers reflects effects of AD neuropathology on neurophysiology of brain neural signal transmission underpinning cognitive processes.
It is the "gap" of physiology in the amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration framework of biomarkers in AD research
To fill that gap, measures of eyes-closed resting state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms are quite promising as they are non-invasive, reproducible (without learning effects) until severe dementia, cost-effective, and based on recording techniques largely available worldwide including lower-and middle-income countries
These measures may probe effects of AD on ascending activating systems and reciprocal thalamocortical circuits in which oscillatory (de)synchronizing signals dynamically underpin cortical arousal in the regulation of quiet vigilance
This phase synchronization/desynchronization of cortical neural activity may occur in an interrelated way in multiple cortical areas, gating transmissions and communications of action potentials within both local and long-range neural networks
Animal studies elucidated the cellular and molecular basis of ongoing EEG activity at cortical and subcortical level
Furthermore, they demonstrated that AD neuropathology may cause disconnection among neural cells, damage to cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways, and loss of myelinated axons possibly associated with cortical neural hyperexcitability and hypersynchronization as well as reduced neurotransmission, neural signaling and synaptic activity
Panel 1: Experimental conditions of recordings of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in quiet vigilance (resting state) in humans.

Neurophysiological mechanisms, duration, and instructions
• Neurophysiological mechanisms keeping the state of low vigilance with eyes-closed for several minutes (i.e., 5-15 minutes or more).
It also probes the transition to drowsiness and sleep, hence the experimenter (or trained technologist) should not alert the subject in case of sleep.
The instructions invite the subject to sit quietly, stay relaxed in a state of mind wandering (i.e., no goal-oriented mental activity), and keep the eyes closed.
• Neurophysiological mechanisms regulating the increase and decrease in the vigilance level while opening and closing the eyes sequentially (i.e.,
The periods of eyes-open and -closed in response to the experimenter's cue are short (i.e., 1 min), and the sequence of eyes-open and -closed is repeated (i.e., 2-4 times).
The instructions to the subject are like those of the first condition.
The experimenter will have to alert the subject in case of sleep to have enough EEG data related to the proper mental state.
• The third condition tests the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the steady maintenance of low vigilance at eyes-closed (i.e.,
The instructions to the subject are like those of the second condition.
Due to the resistive features of skull and scalp, rsEEG rhythms recorded at the scalp level is mainly represented by frequencies spanning about from 1 to 100 Hz, detectable by the high temporal resolution (< 1 ms) of EEG recording systems
In artifact-free rsEEG activity, posterior ("dominant") alpha rhythms  are the dominant oscillations and reduce in amplitude in the transition from eyes closed to open condition, due to activation of visual-spatial cortical systems
In quiet vigilance (no task demands), high amplitude of low-frequency alpha rhythms (about 8-10 Hz) may reflect low levels of general brain arousal, attention, and readiness

Spatial resolution
During sensorimotor and cognitive events, alpha rhythms are replaced by faster cortical rsEEG oscillations, namely high-frequency beta
In healthy adults, rsEEG activity at delta
Therefore, abnormally prominent theta or delta rhythms in the resting state condition are considered as signs of brain dysfunctions
frequency-bin-by-frequency bin (Figure
Other methods estimate "interrelatedness of rsEEG activity at scalp electrode pairs or EEG source connectivity," based on an assumption of linearity or nonlinearity of rsEEG signals
The inclusion of rsEEG measures in AD clinical trials (e.g., patients' stratification, monitoring disease progression, efficacy of therapeutics, etc.) as enriching neurophysiological biomarkers has to steam on a preliminary demonstration that those measures are reliable, consistent, and sensitive (e.g., test-retest reliability, effect and sample sizes, etc.).
For example, the statistical power and the variability of effect-sample sizes of a given rsEEG measure are relevant parameters to evaluate if that candidate biomarker can be included in clinical trial protocols of phases > 1 designed for AD patients, namely protocols testing the neurobiological efficacy and therapeutic effects of new drugs against AD.
It should be considered that clinical trials of phases 2 and 3 typically involve 100-300 and 300-3,000 patients for each patients' group, respectively
Therefore, a suitable rsEEG biomarker is expected to be reliable, consistent, and have a sample size substantially lower than n=300 patients for group.
Concerning the issue of test-retest reliability, previous studies reported that the power density of artifact-free rsEEG rhythms is stable at 12-40 months retest performed in healthy adults
Namely, those studies showed high test-retest correlations (r = 0.92 at 5 min, 0.84 at 12-14 weeks,
Furthermore, the absolute and relative power densities of rsEEG activity, including dominant posterior alpha rhythms during the eyes-closed condition, were quite consistent when computed from artifact-free rsEEG data lasting 20 s, 40 s, 60 s to 4 minutes
In general, results of the previous test-retest studies showed that the rsEEG relative power density was slightly more repeatable than the absolute power density, probably for the general property of normalization procedures to reduce measure variabilities
Furthermore, the reproducibility of spectral rsEEG measures over sessions was higher in the eyes-closed than -open condition, possibly due to the effects of residual blinking and saccades in the data used for rsEEG spectral analyses
Moreover, the reproducibility of rsEEG measures was higher in rsEEG power density than interrelatedness (connectivity) estimates at both sensor and source levels
Finally, such a reproducibility was slightly higher at sensor than source levels, but the findings encouraged the use of both levels of analysis for clinical applications
Keeping in mind the above data and considerations, the reliability and consistency of typical rsEEG measures derived from healthy adults seem to be generally suitable for applications in Clinical Neurophysiology
However, those statistical features should be carefully taken into account to interpret the statistical effects reported in the studies using rsEEG measures to compare AD and control individuals and to investigate AD progression and therapy responses.

Gore graph indexes in rsEEG research
• "Clustering coefficient" as the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
• "Path length" as the mean number of edges any node needs to reach the others of the graph.
• "Betweenness centrality" as number of edges one node needs to reach all the other nodes of the graph (the lower the number, the higher the centrality).
• "Clustering coefficient" as the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
• "Local efficiency" is computed on node neighborhoods and is related to the clustering coefficient ("global efficiency") as a measure of how efficiently it exchanges information among nodes of the network.
• "Modularity" as the degree to which the network may be subdivided into delineated groups.
• "Small-worldness" is defined as a good balance between an intense local connectivity and effective "hubs" connecting far nodes.
• "Robustness and adaptation" are the ability of a network to maintain its connectivity when a fraction of nodes (links) is damaged.

Aims and methodology
Although international panels of experts have emphasized the merits of rsEEG measures in AD research
"Electroencephalography (EEG)", "Resting State EEG", "Ongoing EEG", "Background EEG", "Quantitative EEG (qEEG)", "Brain rhythms", and "Brain Oscillations."
For the "EEG measures of interest," we used the following key words: "Waveforms (i.e., visual analysis and description of well-known graphoelements observed on ongoing rsEEG traces), "EEG Power Density," "Relative Power Density," "Alpha peak frequency,"
"Complexity and Irregularity (referring to the dynamics of temporal patterns at one scalp electrode or spatiotemporal patterns in many scalp electrodes)
"Phase-Amplitude Coupling," "Synchronization likelihood (SL)," "Phase Lag Index (PLI),"
"Phase Locking Value (PLV)," "Amplitude Envelope Correlation (AEC)," "Graph Theory," "Clustering coefficient," "Characteristic path length," "Modularity index," "Linear Source Estimation," "Nonlinear Source Estimation," "Functional Connectivity," and "Inverse problem."
For the "Experimental design of interest," the following key words were used:
"Longitudinal studies" (cohorts of AD patients followed over time), "Cross-sectional studies"
(samples of AD patients with different severity and disease duration), "Classification studies"
(accuracy of EEG measures in the discrimination between controls, patients with AD and/or other types of cognitive impairment at individual level).
Only papers published in international journals with peer-review and impact factor were selected (-2020).
Some papers could not be downloaded from available Internet resources and were not considered.
All selected abstracts/papers were critically reviewed by selected taking into account the criteria reported in Jelic and Kowalski
The validity of the rsEEG measures was mainly based on the guidelines for rsEEG recordings and data analysis in Clinical Neurophysiology
The selected rsEEG papers were distinguished in three arbitrary classes with increasing weight in the formulation of the recommendations.
They were as follows:
1) Class A. ADD or ADMCI patients mostly diagnosed using qualified CSF or PET diagnostic biomarkers of AD
When the data were available in the Class-A paper, we reported the effect and sample sizes of the main rsEEG measures characterizing AD patients over controls (see Tables
2) Class B. ADD or ADMCI patients enrolled using traditional criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD as inclusion criteria [e.g., 44] and large populations (> 100 participants) of AD and control CU persons.
3) Class C. As Class B but with smaller populations (< 100 participants).
In the article, Class C papers were described without reporting the "Class C" label and without the specification of the number of persons for the sake of brevity.
In the normal brain, dominant EEG rhythms are observed at alpha frequencies
These networks would span neural populations of cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal forebrain and brainstem, including glutamatergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotoninergic parts of the reticular ascending systems.
In the brain of AD patients, the amplitude of these rhythms is reduced (i.e., tonic background desynchronization) together with an amplitude increase of the pathological rsEEG slow frequencies spanning delta (< 4 Hz) and theta
This "slowing" of rsEEG rhythms would mainly reflect a sort of thalamocortical "disconnection mode".

RsEEG MEASURES FOR AD PATIENTS' STRATIFICATION

"Local" measures of rsEEG rhythms in AD patients
ADD and ADMCI patients repeatedly showed marked changes in linear measures of rsEEG power density at delta, theta, and alpha bands in relation to CSF, neuroimaging, and clinical markers.
The main results are reported below.
In two experiments of the international multicentric North Baltic (NORDEEG) study (Class A), as compared to age-matched old cognitively unimpaired (CU) persons (n=138), ADD (n=117) and ADMCI (n=138) patients showed increased global theta power density and lower cognitive performance as well as a positive relationship between posterior alphabeta power density and cognitive performance
Furthermore, decreased CSF amyloid β42 significantly correlated with increased theta and delta power density averaged across all electrodes (global field power, GFP) in patients diagnosed with subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 210), MCI (n=230), and ADD (n=197).
In contrast, increased p-and t-tau correlated with decreased alpha and beta GFP
Moreover, decreased CSF amyloid β42 and increased p-and t-tau were significantly associated with decreased alpha and beta global field synchronization (GFS) at zero voltage across all alectrodes as a function of cognitive status
European multicentric PHARMACOG study (Class A) compared rsEEG measures in amnesic MCI seniors with diagnostic CSF markers incompatible (noADMCI, n = 54) and compatible (ADMCI, n = 72) with AD diagnosis
A statistical model incorporated rsEEG source estimates from recordings performed every 6 months for 2 years.
Results displayed that as compared to noADMCI patients, ADMCI patients were characterized by greater global delta and theta source activity and greater ratio between posterior delta-theta and alpha source activity
Furthermore, ADMCI patients who could be evaluated until the last follow-up (n=63) exhibited an association between occipital theta/alpha source activity and global cognitive status, as measured by ADAS-cog13 score, and reduced connectivity within the default mode network in resting state functional MRI markers
In an ITALIAN-TURKEY rsEEG study (Class A), as compared to CU persons (n=60), ADMCI patients with high (n=35) and low (n=35) education attainments presented greater alpha source activations topographically widespread
On the contrary, in relation to the ADMCI subgroup with the low education attainment, the ADMCI subgroup with the high education attainment displayed lower alpha source activations topographically widespread (notably, the two ADMCI subgroups had matched cerebrospinal AD diagnostic biomarkers, APOE4 genotyping, brain gray-white matter measures, and neuropsychological scores).
Another study
Those patients showed significant negative correlation between CSF beta-amyloid (Aβ)-42 concentration and the logarithms of CSD over the right temporal area in the theta band.
Total tau concentration was negatively correlated with the lagged phase synchronization (LPS) between the left frontal eye field and the right auditory area in the alpha-2 band in patients with AD.
The effects of AD neuropathology on the amplitude of delta, theta, and alpha rhythms are corroborated by the following studies of independent worldwide consortia (Class B).
In a study based on the NEWYORK (n=264) and the STOCKHOLM (n=155) rsEEG databases, ADD and ADMCI patients were characterized by decreased alpha, beta, and gamma Global Field Synchronization (GFS), and increased delta GFS as compared to CU individuals with intact cognition
In another STOCKHOLM rsEEG study, ADD (n=38) patients showed decreased alpha and beta GFP, and anteriorization of dipole source location fitting scalp alpha and beta rhythms as compared to ADMCI (n=31) and age-matched CU persons (n=24)
In some experiments of the ITALIAN rsEEG study, as compared to CU persons (n=126), ADD (n=193) and ADMCI (n=155) patients presented a widespread increase of delta source activity and a decrease of posterior alpha source activity in relation to cognitive performance, as revealed by mini mental state evaluation (MMSE) score and other neuropsychological tests
Furthermore, those abnormalities in rsEEG source activities were related to structural (e.g., hippocampal and cortical gray matter atrophy)
Findings at source level were cross validated by GFP markers at the scalp level.
In fact, ADMCI patients (n=85) showed that the ratio between theta and gamma power density and the ratio between high-and low-frequency alpha power density were related to gray matter atrophy in hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia in relation to cognitive status
In the European DESCRIPA rsEEG study, when compared to non-amnesic MCI (n=51), SMC (n=53) not tested for amyloid deposition in the brain, and age-matched CU (n=79) persons, ADMCI patients (n=92) exhibited increased occipital-frontal theta source activity and lower posterior alpha source activity
In the study by Roh and colleagues, as compared to CU persons (n=39), ADD (n=41)
and ADMCI (n=38) patients presented (1) higher temporal and parieto-occipital theta power density and a decrease of posterior alpha source activity and (
Other rsEEG studies of Class C showed similar results about delta, theta, and alpha power density in relation to cognitive functions
Furthermore, beta power density
Other studies of Class B and C explored the relationship between rsEEG power density and neuroimaging measures in ADD patients.
As compared to age-matched CU persons, ADD patients showed abnormal resting state functional MRI connectivity and decreased regional cortical blood perfusion and or metabolism by 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT or FDG-PET and scans,

Age and genetic risk factors
The above effects were modulated by age and genetic risk factors, as shown by the following rsEEG studies (Class B), while gender factor was matched or used as a covariate.
In the rsEEG study of VU Amsterdam University Medical Center (AMSTERDAM study), abnormalities in delta and alpha power density were more pronounced in young (≤ 65 years) than old (> 65 years) seniors with ADD (n=320) and intact cognition (n=246)
In the ITALIAN rsEEG study, posterior alpha source activity was lower in ADMCI patients (n=84) than in age-matched CU persons (n=89), especially in those patients carrying the haplotype B of cystatin C genotyping
A similar effect on posterior alpha source activity was also observed in ADMCI (n=89) and ADD patients (n=103) with ApoEϵ4 genotyping over non-carriers
This effect was replicated in ADD (n=125) and CU persons (n=60) in an independent study using a similar methodology
However, it was not replicated in the AMSTERDAM study carried out with ADD (n=320) and CU persons (n=246)
using a methodological approach based on scalp rsEEG power density measures
The above rsEEG measures (e.g., increased delta-theta power density and decreased posterior alpha power density) differed in ADD and ADMCI patients in other studies, as reported by the following studies (Class B).
As compared to age-matched CU persons (n=35), ADD patients (n=61) were characterized by abnormalities in widespread scalp delta power density
A rsEEG study by the European Consortium of Lewy Body Dementia (E-DLB study) was performed in CU (n=42) and ADD (n=42) patients, Results displayed greater abnormalities in posterior alpha source activity and fewer abnormalities in delta source activity estimated in AD patients over controls
In the ITALIAN study, there was greater delta and theta GFP and lower alpha GFP in ADD (n=60) than age-matched CU persons (n=30)
Furthermore, as compared to age-matched CU persons (n=38), ADD patients (n=48)
showed reduction in posterior alpha source activities and increase in spatially widespread delta source activities
In another rsEEG study

Preclinical AD
Previous rsEEG studies showed mixed results in SMC seniors with significant amyloid brain deposition (preclinical Alzheimer's neuropathology).
In the French INSIGHT-preAD study (Class A), SMC seniors (n=318) 70-85 years old were tested by 18 F-florbetapir PET SUVR as marker of amyloid deposition in the brain and received an extensive data collection including rsEEG recordings
Three articles reported the rsEEG findings.
In the first study
In the second study
In the third study
Taken together, those findings suggest that the preclinical Alzheimer's neuropathology may affect rsEEG rhythms in SMC seniors but with variable consequences on posterior alpha rhythms or other rsEEG measures.

Nonlinear rsEEG measures
Nonlinear rsEEG measures demonstrated an overall loss of EEG complexity in ADD patients
Furthermore, ADD and VaD patients showed different EEG complexity values
Overall, the following considerations motivate further validation studies before the use of nonlinear complexity rsEEG measures in regular AD clinical trials: (i) the heterogeneity of the above reference theories and methodological procedures (i.e., information theory, entropy, chaos, etc.); (ii) experimental databases with relatively small groups of AD patients; (iii) variable findings at rsEEG frequency bands
(iv) sensitivity of those measures to instrumental and biological noise; and (v) the lack of validations with neuroimaging and diagnostic biomarkers of AD.

RsEEG measures of "interrelatedness/source connectivity"
In the INSIGHT-PreAD project (Class A), as compared to SMC seniors (n=175) without significant amyloid accumulation in the brain, those with preclinical Alzheimer's neuropathology (n=25) showed that neurodegeneration, as revealed by FDG-PET hypometabolism, was associated with increased frontocentral beta and gamma power density, decreased delta power density, higher spectral entropy, higher complexity, and increased functional connectivity measured by weighted symbolic mutual information in theta rhythms Interestingly, if persons with neurodegeneration exceeded a certain threshold of amyloid load, the whole trend of rsEEG metrics reversed with increased delta power and the decrement of the following variables: beta and gamma power, median spectral frequency, spectral entropy, complexity and others typically characterizing ADMCI and ADD
A bulk of previous studies have shown convergent evidence of differences between CU persons and ADD patients in measures of "interrelatedness" of rsEEG rhythms at electrode pairs or estimates of cortical source connectivity.
Many of them were performed using "spectral coherence" at electrode pairs, a very popular linear rsEEG technique.
As compared with age-matched CU persons, ADD patients pointed to lower "spectral coherence"
between electrode pairs at alpha
However, these effects were topographically variable being observed in temporo-parieto-occipital electrode pairs in some investigations [100; 106; 111] and frontocentral [104] and fronto-parietooccipital electrode pairs in others
In the AMSTERDAM study (Class B), global alpha and beta "synchronization likelihood" across all combinations of electrode pairs (sensitive to both linear and nonlinear "interrelatedness") was lower in ADD (n=109) and ADMCI (n=88) patients as compared to age-matched CU persons
Furthermore, the ADD patients exhibited decreased global alpha "phase lag index" in relation to disease severity
In the same line, the ITALIAN multicentric rsEEG study (Class B) reported a reduction of the global alpha "spectral coherence" in ADMCI patients (n=57) as a function of the cerebrovascular impairment in cholinergic tracts from basal forebrain to cerebral cortex as revealed by
These effects were spatially specified in ADD (n=109), VaD (n=25), and ADMCI (n=88) patients as compared to CU (n=69)
In relation to the CU persons, the ADD and ADMCI patients showed a reduction in fronto-parietal alpha "synchronization likelihood"
Furthermore, "directed transfer function" (DTF; a multivariate measure of directional rsEEG "interrelatedness" derived from Granger causality)
was lower from parietal to frontal electrodes in ADD and ADMCI patients as compared to age-matched CU persons
This effect was confirmed in independent investigations
In a monocentric rsEEG study (Class B), another measure related to "spectral coherence" (namely, "phase synchronization") showed decreased alpha "interrelatedness" between temporal and parietal electrodes in ADD (n=125) patients compared with agematched CU persons (n=60)
In the European E-DLB study (Class B), another rsEEG measure called "linear lagged connectivity" (removing the zero-lag "interrelatedness" more sensitive to head volume conduction effects) exhibited widespread lowering of alpha inter-hemispherical alpha source connectivity in ADD (n=120) and ADMCI patients (n=70) as compared to age-matched CU persons (n=100)
The effect of AD on the above rsEEG "interrelatedness" was less clear at delta (< 4
Hz) and theta
In a large monocentric rsEEG study (Class B), global theta "phase synchronization" was higher in ADD patients (n=125) over CU (n=60)
In the ITALIAN rsEEG study (Class B), "linear lagged connectivity" exhibited higher delta inter-hemispherical connectivity at occipital sources and higher theta intrahemispherical connectivity at occipital-temporal sources in ADD patients (n=120) compared with age-matched CU persons (n=100)
showed widespread increased interrelatedness at delta rhythms in ADD (n=82) and ADMCI patients (n=88) over CU persons (n=69)
In contrast, a national monocentric rsEEG study displayed decreased "phase lag index" (removing the influence of zero-lag coherence) at the delta and theta rhythms within the frontal and between the frontal and temporal/parietal electrodes in ADMCI patients (n=9)
as compared to age-matched CU persons (n=14)
Some divergent results in the above studies may be due to different applied rsEEG measures of "interrelatedness" ("spectral coherence, synchronization likelihood, phase lag index, lagged connectivity, DTF") and their different sensitivity to head volume conduction and common drive effects (see Supplementary materials: Main features of rsEEG measures used in AD studies for more discussion).

"Local and interrelatedness" measures of rsEEG rhythms in the classification of AD individuals
RsEEG measures may be used to quantify brain neurophysiological dysfunctions in ADD and ADMCI individuals for their sub-group stratification in observational and intervention clinical trials.
This use may imply a classification rate > 80% in the discrimination between AD and control individuals based on rsEEG measures.
In the NORDEEG study (Class A), temporal theta power density showed a classification rate of 73% in the discrimination between ADD (n=117) and CU persons (n=138)
In the same study, combined alpha and theta GFP reached 84% in the discrimination between ADD (n=38) and CU (n=24) persons as well 78% between ADD and ADMCI patients
Furthermore, alpha and theta relative power density combined with mean frequency from left temporo-occipital electrodes (T5-O1) correctly predicted ADMCI (n=27) patients progressing to dementia with an accuracy of 85%
In the AMSTERDAM study (Class A), global rsEEG power density, pair-wise "interrelatedness" ("phase transfer entropy"), and minimum spanning tree graph indexes at several frequency bands were used to train random forest learning machines (i.e., highest degree, leaf number, and tree hierarchy) for classifications between ADD (n=66) and agematched CU persons (n=66) individuals
This approach reached 62% of classification accuracy in the discrimination between the CU persons and ADD individuals.
In the ITALIAN rsEEG study (Class B), the ratio between parieto-occipital delta and alpha cortical source activities reached discriminated ADD (n=127) and age-matched CU persons (n=121) individuals with 75% of area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
The clinical significance of those results was also tested by a correlation analysis between the activity of parieto-occipital cortical delta or alpha 1 sources and the MMSE score in all Nold and AD subjects as a whole group
Results showed that the higher the activity of parieto-occipital delta sources, the lower the MMSE scores (i.e., global cognitive status).
Furthermore, the higher the activity of dominant parieto-occipital alpha 1 sources, the higher the MMSE scores.
Furthermore, a first-order polynomial regression of graph small-worldness index reached an area under the ROC curve of 61% in discriminating between stable (n=74) and progressing (n=71) ADMCI patients, while considering ApoEϵ4 allele it reached 97% accuracy
[131].
In Bennys and colleagues
The above results were corroborated using more advanced mathematical classifiers based on learning classifiers (see caveats in the Supplementary materials: The risk of 1 SES method relies on i) identification of so-called "bumps" in the time-frequency space and ii) aligning the bumps.
The discrimination is based on parameters: ρ: fraction of non-coincident bumps, δt and δf : average time and frequency offsets respectively between coincident bumps.
However the problem of aligning is ambiguous and depends on arbitrary choices.

"inflated" discrimination accuracy in classification studies) in the following large national monocentric rsEEG studies (Class B).
A In the NORDEEG study (Class A), a stepwise classification procedure using support vector machines as a statistical pattern recognition (SPR) produced 5 values from 0 to 1 for each person, based on the analysis of 20 selected rsEEG measures (i.e., power density and "spectral coherence") extracted from the original EEG recording.
These 5 values referred to the following diagnostic labels: "NRM" (CU persons index), "sMCI" (MCI index), "AD" (AD Keeping in mind the above rsEEG results at the individual level, combined "synchronization" and "interrelatedness" measures across rsEEG frequency bands could repeatedly produce binary classifications of ADD and ADMCI over control CU persons with an accuracy ranging from 90% to 70%, thus potentially being useful for patient stratification purposes in AD clinical trials.
Notably, the use of these binary classifications for monomodal diagnostic purposes provided modest accuracy around 60%.

Topology of the "interrelatedness/functional connectivity" measures of rsEEG rhythms in ADD and ADMCI patients: the new wave of the graph theory indices
The popular Graph theory probed the topology of rsEEG "interrelatedness" at electrode or source pairs in the comparison between groups of ADD/ADMCI patients and CU individuals
As compared to age-matched CU persons, ADD and ADMCI patients were characterized by a more random topology of rsEEG "interrelatedness" at electrode or source pairs, possibly due a reduction in "small worldness"
properties of the underlying cortical neural networks
However, it should be remarked that the rsEEG studies lending support to such an interpretation exhibited inconsistent findings about the single graph indices forming the "small world" construct (i.e., "clustering coefficient" and "path length") and unclear effects on delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands
This inconsistency can be explained at least in part by (i) different rsEEG measures of "interrelatedness" used in those studies; (ii) the application of bivariate measures of such "interrelatedness," which are more sensitive to volume conduction and common drive effects than multivariate measures are (see Supplement 2.2); (iii) the use of sensor vs. source level; and (iv) diverse statistical thresholds used 5).
Beyond small worldness, further graph measures were tested (see Panel 2 for the definitions).
In the NORTH-EAST ENGLAND study (Class A), minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of "phase lag index" of rsEEG rhythms at electrode pairs were used to model the hierarchical clustering organization of cortical networks as topology of rsEEG "interrelatedness" between CU individuals (n=17) and ADD (n=26)
Compared to agematched CU persons, the ADD patients showed lower alpha "phase lag index" and lower dominant frequency (maximum rsEEG power density at alpha range)
In the AMSTERDAM study (Class B), MSTs of "phase lag index" of rsEEG rhythms at electrode pairs were also used to model the topology of rsEEG "interrelatedness" between ADD (n=133) and CU individuals (n=115)
Compared to age-matched CU persons, ADD patients presented decreases of alpha "phase lag index" with increasing disease severity and a shift of the "betweenness centrality" center of mass from posterior to more anterior scalp regions ("nodes") with increasing disease severity
Concerning the specificity of those results, frontal delta "phase lag index" was selectively affected in bvFTD patients (n=48) against the background of preserved "global efficiency", whereas parietal and occipital loss of network organization and "global efficiency" was observed in ADD patients (n=69) in relation to decreased alpha "phase lag index"
Keeping in mind the above results, the graph topology of the "interrelatedness" of rsEEG rhythms may enrich our understanding of AD as a "disconnection" syndrome
However, the most consistent topographic patterns and rsEEG measures to model this abnormality for systematic applications in AD clinical trials has not yet been determined.
More international research is needed to improve the promising techniques computing the "interrelatedness" of rsEEG activity based on multivariate models and source estimations

Predictive value of baseline rsEEG measures in CU persons and AD seniors
Previous longitudinal studies in CU persons and AD patients tested the value of rsEEG measures derived from baseline datasets to predict their cognitive status at followups.
In the AMSTERDAM rsEEG study (Class A), high delta-theta and lower alpha power density predicted clinical worsening over time in SCD (n=63) and MCI patients (n=142) with amyloid deposition in the brain
In the STOCKHOLM rsEEG study (Class A), combined alpha and theta power density and mean frequency from left temporal-occipital regions predicted cognitive decline in ADMCI patients (n=27) at 1-year follow-up
In a parallel rsEEG study, anterior localization of alpha sources predicted the cognitive decline in ADMCI patients (n=31) at about 2-year follow-up
In another national rsEEG study (Class B), low posterior alpha power density predicted the cognitive decline in ADMCI (n=88) and ADD (n=42) patients at 1-year followup
In the ITALIAN rsEEG study (Class B), ADMCI patients (n=74) with high alpha3/alpha2 frequency power density ratio at scalp electrodes presented greater cortical atrophy and lower perfusion rate in the temporo-parietal cortex as revealed by neuroimaging markers and conversion to ADD status at 3-year follow up
Furthermore, high temporal delta source activity predicted marked cognitive decline in ADMCI patients (n=69) at an average of
In the NEWYORK rsEEG study, high temporoparietal theta power density and slowing of mean rsEEG frequency predicted cognitive decline from SMC (n=44) to significant cognitive deficits at 7-9-year follow-up with an overall predictive accuracy of 90%, thus extending previous evidence of the same Workgroup in CU persons, SMC,
In another national rsEEG study, baseline high theta power density and cognitive performance predicted cognitive decline at an average of 20-month follow-up with an overall predictive accuracy of 93% in CU persons ranging from intact cognition (n=24) to ADMCI (n=20) and ADD (n=14) status
Tables
They lead support to the value of rsEEG measures of "cortical neural synchronization" and "interrelatedness/connectivity" in the characterization of AD status and prediction of cognitive decline for patients' stratification purposes in clinical trials.
The most prominent effects of neurodegeneration on EEG metrics were localized in frontocentral regions with an increase in high frequency oscillations (higher beta and gamma power) and a decrease in low frequency oscillations (lower delta power) Compared to the noADMCI patients, the ADMCI patients were characterized by greater global delta and theta source activity and lower ratio between posterior delta-theta and alpha source activity.
The output of the Linear Mixed Models was presented in terms of standardized coefficient, corresponding p-value and, for the interaction factor only, effect size (pseudo h2) calculated as the ratio of explained variability of interaction effect on the total variability of each model.

MEASURES OF rsEEG RHYTHMS REFLECTING AD PROGRESSION AND EFFECTS OF INTERVENTION

Value of rsEEG measures of disease progression in ADMCI and ADD patients
Several studies on AD and CU persons tested the value of rsEEG measures to monitor progression of brain dysfunctions comparing those measures derived from baseline and follow-up recordings.
Core results are reported in the following.
In the STOCKHOLM rsEEG study (Class A), ADMCI (n=27) seniors showed increased temporal and occipital theta-delta power density and decreased beta power density at an averaged follow-up of 21 months [106].
In the international multicentric PHARMACOG rsEEG study (Class A), as compared to noADMCI patients (n=54), ADMCI patients (n=72) presented increased limbic theta source activity and greater cognitive decline at 24-month follow-up in relation to reduced functional connectivity within cortical default mode network as revealed by resting state fMRI
In the ITALIAN rsEEG study (Class B), in relation to age-matched CU persons (n=35), ADD patients (n=88) showed increased delta and reduced parieto-occipital alpha and beta source activities at an averaged follow-up of 13 months
In the same study, similar effects were observed at the prodromal stage of ADMCI
Specifically, the ADMCI patients (n=55) displayed reduced alpha source activities in posterior regions at an averaged follow-up of 13 months.
Other national monocentric studies on AD and control CU persons tested the value of rsEEG measures to monitor progressive brain dysfunctions.
ADD patients (n=40) presented increased parietal and occipital theta-delta power density and reduced alpha-beta power density at an averaged follow-up of
In another study, half of ADD patients (n=40) were characterized by increased temporal and occipital delta-theta power density at an averaged follow-up of
In another study, ADD patients showed increased delta-theta power density and decreased alpha power density at an averaged follow-up of 2 years while no changes were observed in VaD and functional psychiatric patients
Finally, measures of "interrelatedness" of rsEEG rhythms revealed progressive brain dysfunctions in AD patients.
Compared with age-matched CU persons (n=14), ADMCI patients (n=9) exhibited decreased delta and theta "phase lag index" within frontal and between frontal and temporal/parietal areas at 1-year follow-up [128].

Value of rsEEG measures in monitoring disease progression and intervention in ADMCI and ADD patients
Several national studies presented effects of Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), enhancing the cholinergic tone, on rsEEG measures obtained in ADD patients.
In the STOCKHOLM rsEEG study (Class A), as compared to untreated ADD patients, AD patients (n=15) receiving AChEIs (tacrine) had a reduction of theta GFP after 3 and 12 months of while both delta and theta GFP reduced after 6 months (n=10)
These results extended previous evidence
In the GERMAN study (Class B), rsEEG measures were sensitive to AChEIs in ADD patients.
In a group of AD patients alpha-theta power density ratio responded to a single dose of AChEIs (tetrahydroaminoacridine) predicting clinical effects of a chronic treatment of 7 weeks
In other ADD patients (n=15), a significant reduction in spatially widespread delta and theta power density was observed after AChEI treatment (rivastigmine) of 5 days
[175], while after treatment of 1-2 weeks (rivastigmine) only decreased theta power density (n=35) was observed
In another group of ADD patients (n=20), decreased theta power density after 1 week and short-term memory performance did predict treatment response (rivastigmine) at
In the ITALIAN rsEEG study (Class B), in relation to CU individuals (n=65), ADD patients (n=58) presented a reduction in posterior alpha source activity at 1-year follow-up, which was less marked in those patients (n=28) clinically responding to concomitant treatment with AChEIs (donepezil), as revealed by global cognitive status (i.e., MMSE score), when compared to those who did not respond (n=30)
Other smaller national rsEEG studies reported similar effects in ADD patients.
Specifically, AD patients (n=18) showed a significant reduction in temporal delta power density and an increase in power density at other frequency ranges including temporal and centroparietal theta after AChEIs (donepezil) administered for
This effect was in line with other evidence
Furthermore, another group of ADD patients (n=16) displayed a significant reduction in widespread delta and theta power density after AChEIs (rivastigmine) given for 3 months
Cortical source estimation of those data pointed to significant effects in a network that included left fronto-parietal regions, posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral parahippocampal regions, and the hippocampus
Other pharmacological interventions presented significant effects on rsEEG measures in ADMCI and ADD patients.
Core results are reported in the following.
In the PQ912 study (Class A), ADMCI and ADD patients formed an experimental group (n=60) receiving a 12-week treatment with an inhibitor of the glutaminyl cyclase enzyme (PQ912) that plays a central role in the formation of synaptotoxic pyroglutamate-A-beta oligomers while a placebo group (n=60) received a hypocaloric beverage for the same period.
Results showed an improvement of memory and a reduction of theta GFP in the experimental group as compared with the increase of that rsEEG measure in the placebo group
Of note, the PQ912 intervention did not affect the "phase lag index" as measure of rsEEG "interrelatedness"
In a re-analysis of those rsEEG data, a new measure of rsEEG "interrelatedness" at electrode pairs comprising the amplitude envelope correlation with leakage correction (AEC-c) increased more in the alpha frequency band of the experimental group (n=47) compared to the placebo group (n=56)
In the international SOUVENAID study II (Class B), ADD patients formed an experimental group receiving Souvenaid functional food for 24 weeks (n=86) while a placebo group received a hypocaloric beverage for the same period (n=93).
Results displayed an improvement of memory and an increase in global delta "phase lag index" across all electrode pairs in the Souvenaid group as compared to the placebo group
A re-analysis of "phase lag index" data presented a stable graph index at 24-month follow-up of local brain network connectivity at beta rhythms in a subsample of the experimental group (n=70-66) as compared to the placebo group (n=77-75)

NEUROPATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF EEG MEASURES IN AD PATIENTS
In the review of the literature, AD patients showed the most consistent abnormalities in (eyes-closed) rsEEG rhythms featured as changes in delta-theta and alpha power density at scalp electrodes or estimates of cortical source activity.
It can be speculated that these abnormalities may reflect, directly or indirectly, the effect of AD neuropathology on distributed brain neural networks involved in the generation of cortical rsEEG rhythms and the regulation of general brain arousal, balance of cortical inhibition/excitation, and vigilance
Those networks might be formed by subcortical and cortical neural circuits [187; 14; 188], with a special role of thalamocortical functional connectivity during active event-related information processing
However, more literature relating AD neuropathology to beta and gamma rhythms is emerging.
It was recently shown that once the amyloid load exceeds a certain level, the power spectrum level of beta and gamma decreased markedly
Other bodies of evidence have demonstrated that gamma power as well as gamma coherence is markedly affected in human patients with AD
More discussion about the neurophysiological underpinnings of the rsEEG findings reviewed in this article can be found in the Supplementary materials (Physiological basis of abnormal rsEEG measures in AD patients).

RECOMMENDATIONS

Diagnostic specificity of stand-alone rsEEG measures
Despite historical efforts at evidence-based reviews
Using an evidence-based technique, Jelic and Kowalski
They concluded that although the classification accuracy values were in general high (> 80%), the evidence for the diagnostic utility of rsEEG markers in AD was insufficient to suggest its use alone in memory clinics routines, also considering that they do not provide a direct measure of the underlying AD neuropathology.
Along the same line, international guidelines on AD diagnosis did not recommend the use of rsEEG biomarkers for diagnostic purposes; rather, they target molecular and structural measures of AD neuropathology
Notably, the present review did not find consistent novel findings to change this position to date.
However, novel techniques including rsEEG measures based on local, "interrelatedness/connectivity", and improved/standardized graph theory markers as inputs to machine learning algorithms may hold the promise in increasing the diagnostic utility of quantitative EEG in future, especially in lower-and middle-income countries

Stratification of AD patients in clinical trials based on rsEEG measures
The present article reports that ADD and ADMCI patients may be characterized by consistent changes in rsEEG measures.
The most consistent findings were obtained using linear rsEEG measures pointing to reduced relative power density at scalp electrodes or estimates of source activity as well as reduced "interrelatedness" (e.g., "spectral coherence" and "phase lag index" at electrode pairs or linear lagged source connectivity) at dominant alpha rhythms in posterior regions in ADD and ADMCI patients as compared to age-matched CU persons and patients with matched cognitive deficits due to other neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular causes (Table
Furthermore, the same linear rsEEG measures of amplitude and "interrelatedness" of posterior theta rhythms were repeatedly associated with higher probability to develop a significant cognitive decline in CU persons and AD patients (Table
Also, rsEEG measures at delta frequencies were often reported as significant markers (Tables
Those linear rsEEG measures are recommended for the stratification of ADD and ADMCI patients in a stepwise triage procedure for the enrollment of patients in clinical trials.
In the first step, probable ADD and ADMCI patients may be selected based on the traditional NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD
In the second step, these patients may receive standard non-invasive and cost-effective rsEEG recordings and be sub-grouped in those with lowest vs. highest abnormalities in rsEEG measures (i.e., threshold based on median values).
In the third step, the ADD and ADMCI patients with the highest abnormalities of rsEEG measures may receive invasive and relatively expensive procedures to extract CSF and neuroimaging diagnostic biomarkers of AD
Only the ADD and ADMCI patients who are positive for those diagnostic biomarkers would then be used in the observational or intervention clinical trials.
This procedure would confer some benefit to financial resources, reducing the number of patients "negative" to the CSF and neuroimaging diagnostic biomarkers of AD in the enrollment phase.
Furthermore, the enrolled patients having highest abnormalities of rsEEG measures may be ideal to test new diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions in ADD and ADMCI patients.
(allowing big data analytics), and algorithms/classification models to be developed/tested against one another, accelerating the data science in this field.
For this purpose, repositories could be used such as OpenNEURO (
In those initiatives, an important role should be played by regulatory authorities (e.g.
Food and Drug Administration, European Medicine Agency, etc.), international scientific Societies of Clinical Neurophysiology and Neurology, and Alzheimer's Association as validated rsEEG measures are expected to be used as biomarkers in clinical trials relevant for drug regulation and licensing in the future.
A summary of the recommendations of the present expert panel is reported in Panel 3.

Panel 3: Recommendations

Summary
• "Data acquisition" after careful multi-center standardization and harmonization of instructions to patients and rsEEG recordings.
• "Data analysis" based on standardized selection of artifact-free rsEEG periods and extraction of linear "local" (e.g., rsEEG power spectral density) and "interrelatedness/connectivity" rsEEG measures by open-access Internet-based software platforms for replicability.
• "Use" for stratification of AD patients and monitoring of disease progression and intervention.
• "Endorsement" for multi-sectoral international initiatives for further validation of rsEEG measures in AD

CONCLUSIONS
What can be the added value of rsEEG measures for the instrumental assessment and monitoring of disease status and progression in ADD and ADMCI patients?
In precedence, IWG-2 suggested two classes of biomarkers for the assessment of ADD, namely the "diagnostic" biomarkers (i.e., those measuring the pathophysiological hallmarks of the disease such as the cerebral amyloidosis and the amount of total or phospho-tau in the cerebrospinal fluid or directly within the brain by PET), and the "progression or topographical" biomarkers (i.e., those measuring progression of region-specific neurodegeneration with characteristic "AD-signatures", such as FDG-PET and structural MRI).
More recently, NIA-AA Research Framework
They named "diagnostic disease" biomarkers as those measuring cerebral amyloidosis (i.e., "A" biomarkers) and phospho-tau (i.e., "T" biomarkers) by CSF or PET techniques.
They also named "neurodegenerative/progression" biomarkers (i.e., "N" biomarkers) those measuring total tau by CSF sampling, FDG-PET hypometabolism, and structural MRI markers of brain atrophy.
Keeping in mind the "physiologic" meaning of rsEEG measures reviewed in the present article, we posit that the term "physiologic (P) biomarker".
In this line, the AD biomarker framework
This "P" biomarker (e.g., + or -) may possibly reflect vulnerability or resilience of subcortical and thalamocortical loops and the ascending activating systems as additional and supplementary relevant information concerning the AD status and progression.


Group (IWG) and the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association Research Framework (NIA-AA Research Framework) have recently proposed and refined recommendations and research criteria for the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the preclinical, prodromal (with objective mild cognitive impairment, ADMCI), and overt dementia (ADD) stages for clinical trials, based on in-vivo

of EEG techniques is low to moderate (i.e., few centimeters) as compared to the neuroimaging techniques mentioned above.
Indeed, rsEEG activity measured at a scalp electrode may results from cortical sources located several centimeters apart or distributed into large regions due to head volume conduction effects [> 10 cm 2 ; 20].
This resolution depends on the number of scalp EEG electrodes and mathematical techniques for EEG source estimation (Figure 2).

In the normal brain, dominant EEG rhythms are observed at alpha frequencies
These networks would span neural populations of cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal forebrain and brainstem, including glutamatergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotoninergic parts of the reticular ascending systems.
In the brain of AD patients, the amplitude of these rhythms is reduced (i.e., tonic background desynchronization) together with an amplitude increase of the pathological rsEEG slow frequencies

A graph represented these values within their confidence intervals to support the diagnosis.
A seminal experiment tested the diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of clinicians based only on that EEG-based graph, using as a gold standard clinical diagnosis obtained by an experienced multidisciplinary team with the agreement of at least 2 experienced physicians (specialist level in dementia).
The team gave the clinical diagnosis using all available examination results (e.g., clinical, neuropsychological, fluid biomarkers, neuroimaging markers), but independently ("blind") of the EEG results[146].
Five clinical units using harmonized EEG procedures were involved.
This procedure was followed in the diagnosis of ADD (n=32), MCI (n=56, 65% of them having CSF diagnostic biomarker values compatible with AD), and CU individuals (n=41) who had received the evaluation of CSF diagnostic biomarkers[146].
The diagnostic accuracy of the EEG-based graph was expressed as a percentage of correct diagnosis, using the mentioned clinical diagnosis as a gold standard.Results exhibited the following relatively low-moderate diagnostic accuracy based on the EEGbased graph: 60% for ADD vs. MCI, 66% for ADD vs. CU, and 56% for MCI vs. CU persons [146].
In precedence, the same Consortium had developed other experiments (Class B) in larger populations in which not all persons had received CSF diagnostic biomarker analysis.
In an interesting experiment, accuracy in the correct classification of individuals between two groups, based on the mentioned SPR index from 0 to 1, was tested in CU individuals (n=146), ADD (n=135), and LP (n=15) seniors [147].
The SPR index was used as an input for the ROC curve analysis.
Results displayed the following correct binary classifications: 90% for ADD (n=135) vs. CU (n=146) persons [147].
These findings outperformed the same classification exercise based on a standard visual assessment of neuroimaging [148] and agreed with previous evidence obtained by the same classification procedure applied in ADD (n=226), ADMCI (n=41), and CU persons (n=226) [149] from the same NORDEEG cohort.
Similar results were obtained using an independent SPR procedure based on support vector machines carried out in small populations of CU individuals and patients with dementia [150].

In contrast, other rsEEG studies reported widespread increases of "spectral coherence" at delta rhythms[115]or quite complex topographical patterns showing increases and decreases of "spectral coherence" values at different electrode pairs[127].

In other studies, ADD and ADMCI patients received Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) for weeks/months.
