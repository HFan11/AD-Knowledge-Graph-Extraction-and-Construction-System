Enhanced Expression of microRNA-1273g-3p Contributes to Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis by Regulating the Expression of Mitochondrial Genes
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population, but its underlying cause has not been fully elucidated.
Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating the expression levels of genes associated with AD development.
In this study, we analyzed miRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients and cognitively normal (including amyloid positive) individuals.
miR-1273g-3p was identified as an AD-associated miRNA and found to be elevated in the CSF of early-stage AD patients.
The overexpression of miR-1273g-3p enhanced amyloid beta (Aβ) production by inducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairments in AD model cell lines.
A biotin-streptavidin pull-down assay demonstrated that miR-1273g-3p primarily interacts with mitochondrial genes, and that their expression is downregulated by miR-1273g-3p.
In particular, the miR-1273g-3p-target gene TIMM13 showed reduced expression in brain tissues from human AD patients.
These results suggest that miR-1273g-3p expression in an early stage of AD notably contributes to Aβ production and mitochondrial impairments.
Thus, miR-1273g-3p might be a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD and a potential therapeutic target to prevent AD progression.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia.
It is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
AD patients show memory loss and cognitive and behavioral impairments caused by massive neurodegeneration mainly at the medial temporal lobe, which contains the hippocampus and surrounding cortical regions
However, the mechanisms underlying Aβ production and deposition in sporadic AD patients are still poorly understood.
Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has gained attention in the context of Aβ production and neurodegeneration
When mitochondrial activity is defective, insufficient energy production and reactive oxygen species overload induce cellular stress and eventual cell death
Studies showed that the expression of mitochondrial enzymes and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were significantly decreased and that oxidative stress molecules, such as 8-hydroxyguanosine and nitrotyrosine, were increased in early-stage AD patients
In the 3xTG-AD mouse model, mitochondrial respiration was markedly reduced prior to the appearances of cognitive impairment, Aβ plaques, or NFTs
Several other studies demonstrated that impairment of mitochondrial function could induce Aβ production and neurodegeneration.
In particular, cybrid cells containing mitochondria obtained from AD patients showed decreased mitochondrial activity and increased production of Aβ
In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation complexes facilitated Aβ production
Accordingly, studies focusing on the mechanism(s) underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in AD will surely help us unravel the cause of AD pathogenesis.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, are known as an important regulator of gene expression in various physiological processes
Many miRNAs are associated with Aβ processing or NFT formation, and their expression levels are shown to be differentially regulated in AD
miRNAs stably exist in body fluids, either in their free form or packaged into vesicles
Monitoring miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is in direct contact with brain tissue, is considered to be a promising strategy for detecting early events of brain diseases
Studies on the levels of miRNAs in blood or CSF from early-stage AD patients revealed that the plasma levels of miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients
Another study analyzed changes in the level of miRNAs in CSF according to various Braak stages or plaque density stages to determine AD-associated miRNAs
A meta-analysis of miRNAs in brain, blood, and CSF identified miRNAs that appeared to be consistently associated with AD progression
However, we know relatively little about miRNAs in early-stage AD patients and how the altered miRNAs might function in AD progression.
In this study, we report that miR-1273g-3p is significantly upregulated in CSF of earlystage AD patients, as assessed by microarray and qPCR analyses.
A pull-down experiment performed using biotinylated-miR-1273g-3p revealed that miR-1273g-3p primarily interacts with mitochondrial genes and downregulates their expression levels.
Here, miR-1273g-3p causes mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent aspects of AD pathogenesis, such as neurodegeneration and the formation of Aβ plaques.

Results

miR-1273g-3p Is Elevated in the Plasma and CSF of AD Patients
To identify AD-associated miRNAs, we obtained plasma samples from 24 aMCI patients (pooled into 6 samples), 36 AD patients (pooled into 9 samples) and 36 agematched cognitively normal individuals (controls, pooled into 9 samples) and screened miRNAs in these samples using a GeneChip TM miRNA 4.0 array.
The participants were at least 65 years of age who had been clinically diagnosed with AD but had not been subjected to verification of this diagnosis by amyloid-PET imaging or CSF test (Cohort 1 in Table
Microarray analysis of plasma samples allowed us to identify 10 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in aMCI patients versus controls and 5 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in AD patients versus controls.
Among them, we focused on miR-Cells 2021, 10, 2697 6 of 21 1273g-3p that dramatically increased in plasma of both aMCI and AD patients (Figure
miR-1273g-3p was quantified by qPCR in individual plasma samples of a new cohort (n = 83, age ≥ 65 years), in which the participants had been precisely diagnosed with amyloid-PET imaging.
We grouped the participants as follows: presymptomatic AD (PSAD; Aβ-positive but cognitively normal, n = 12), prodromal AD (PDAD; Aβpositive aMCI, n = 20), AD (Aβ-positive dementia, n = 20), and control (Aβ-negative and cognitively normal, n = 31) (Cohort 2 in Table
Our analysis showed that miR-1273g-3p was significantly increased in the plasma of AD patients compared to PSAD and control individuals but there was no significant difference in this parameter between PDAD and control individuals (Figure

Our analysis showed that miR-1273g-3p was significantly increased in the plasma of AD patients compared to PSAD and control individuals but there was no significant difference in this parameter between PDAD and control individuals (Figure
To further substantiate the association of miR-1273g-3p with AD, we examined the levels of miR-1273g-3p in CSF of PSAD (n = 10), PDAD (n = 13), AD (n = 14), and control (n = 13) individuals using qPCR (Cohort 3 in Table
CSF samples were obtained from the same participants whose samples were used for qPCR analysis of plasma miRNAs, and were further obtained for seven new participants, including two controls and one PSAD, one PDAD, and three AD patients.
Compared to controls, significant increase in the CSF level of miR-1273g-3p was detected in PSAD, PDAD, and AD patients (Figure
In addition, the level of miR-1273g-3p in CSF was relatively higher than the levels of other miRNAs, such as AD-related miR-29a-3p
The ROC curve generated using CSF-derived qPCR data indicated that the level of miR-1273g-3p could be used to clearly distinguish PSAD, PDAD and AD patients from age-matched controls (AUC > 0.75) (Figure
Moreover, the level of CSF miR-1273g-3p was negatively correlated with the level of CSF Aβ42, which is known to decrease with AD progression
Based on these data, we suggest that miR-1273g-3p is an AD-associated miRNA.

miR-1273g-3p Facilitates Aβ Production in an AD Model Cell Line
To investigate the association of miR-1273g-3p with AD progression, we examined changes in Aβ production and hyper-phosphorylation of tau in neuroglioma H4 cells expressing APPswe mut ; H4-APPswe), an AD model cell line.
We overexpressed miR-1273g-3p by transfecting cells with a synthetic miR-1273g-3p mimic (Figure
First, we quantified the concentration of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in conditioned medium of H4-APPswe cells by ELISA.
Both Aβ42 and Aβ40 were considerably increased in conditioned medium of miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing cells compared to the negative control (Figure
The increase in Aβ in conditioned medium of miR-1273g-3p overexpressing H4-APPswe was validated by Western blotting (Figure
In addition, the level of APP protein was significantly higher, whereas the levels of c-terminal fragments (CTFs) were not changed, in miR-1273g-3p overexpressing H4-APPswe cells compared with negative control cells (Figure
Based on these observations, we tested the expression of APP-processing genes, such as BACE1, presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10).
Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein levels of BACE1 and nicastrin were significantly increased by miR-1273g-3p overexpression in H4-APPswe cells, whereas the levels of PS1 and ADAM10 were unchanged (Figure
The mRNA levels of BACE1 and nicastrin were also increased, indicating that the expressions of BACE1 and nicastrin are transcriptionally regulated by miR-1273g-3p (Figure
miR-1273g-3passociated increases in BACE1 and Aβ42 production were observed even at lower levels of miR-1273g-3p overexpression which mimics the two-fold increases observed in the CSF of AD patients (Figure
The expression levels of p-Tau T231 and p-Tau S396 were not altered by miR-1273g-3p overexpression in H4-APPswe cells (Figure
Taken together, these results suggest that the increase of miR-1273g-3p expression induces Aβ production in H4-APPswe cells.

The miR-1273g-3p-Mediated Upregulation of BACE1 Is Caused by Oxidative Stress
As BACE1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for production of Aβ peptides
BACE1 expression is well known to be regulated by stress-induced molecules, such as hypoxia induced factor 1α (HIF1α) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
Thus, to elucidate the mechanism by which miR-1273g-3p upregulates BACE1 and downstream Aβ production, we examined the ability of miR-1273g-3p overexpression to alter one of the stress-induced molecule, JNK.
The overexpression of miR-1273g-3p in H4-APPswe cells dramatically increased the level Cells 2021, 10, 2697 8 of 21 of p-JNK T183/Y185 relative to JNK (Figure
In addition, treatment of miR-1273g-3poverexpressing H4-APPswe cells with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (Figure
The increased level of Aβ42 in the conditioned medium was also reduced to the basal level by both treatments (Figure
In contrast, the levels of APP and nicastrin were not significantly reduced by treatment with SP600125 or NAC (Figure
The treatment of mimic transfected H4-APPswe cells with an miR-1273g-3p inhibitor effectively restored BACE1 and p-JNK T183/Y185 to their basal levels (Figure
Collectively, these data support the notion that miR-1273g-3p overexpression upregulates BACE1 expression via JNK signaling, and thereby induces Aβ42 production.

miR-1273g-3p Facilitates Aβ Production in an AD Model Cell Line
To investigate the association of miR-1273g-3p with AD progression, we examined changes in Aβ production and hyper-phosphorylation of tau in neuroglioma H4 cells expressing APPswe mut ; H4-APPswe), an AD model cell line.
We overexpressed miR-1273g-3p by transfecting cells with a synthetic miR-1273g-3p mimic (Figure

Both Aβ42 and Aβ40 were considerably increased in conditioned medium of miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing cells compared to the negative control (Figure
The increase in Aβ in conditioned medium of miR-1273g-3p overexpressing H4-APPswe was validated by Western blotting (Figure
In addition, the level of APP protein was significantly higher, whereas the levels of c-terminal fragments (CTFs) were not changed, in miR-1273g-3p overexpressing H4-APPswe cells compared with negative control cells (Figure

miR-1273g-3p Impairs Mitochondrial Function in H4-APPswe and SH-SY5Y Cells

miR-1273g-3p Impairs Mitochondrial Function in H4-APPswe and SH-SY5Y Cells
As oxidative stress is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction
When H4-APPswe cells overexpressing miR-1273g-3p and negative control cells were stained with MitoTracker TM Red CMX Ros, the cells overexpressing miR-1273g-3p showed significantly lower staining intensity compared to negative control cells (Figure
This result was verified by staining with the carbocyanine-based reagent MitoTracker TM Deep Red FM (Figure
In addition, miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing cells demonstrated dramatic morphological changes of mitochondria.
The numbers of cells with fragmented mitochondria were increased and the numbers of tubulated mitochondria decreased (Figure
These findings supported the qPCR results showing that the levels of expression of MFN1/2 and OPA1, which participate in mitochondrial fusion
The increased concentration of cellular hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and the intensity of CellROX TM Deep Red staining, which detects intracellular ROS, in miR-1273g-3p overexpressing H4-APPswe cells indicate that these cells are under oxidative stress (Figure
When we measured the levels of mRNAs encoding NRF2, SOD1/2 and ACO2, which are responsible for anti-oxidative stress, we found that miR-1273g-3p overexpression significantly decreased the levels of SOD1/2 (Figure
In analysis of the real-time OCR, basal and ATP-linked OCR were considerably decreased in miR-1273g-3p-transfected H4-APPswe cells.
The maximum OCR, which was measured using the uncoupling reagent, FCCP, was also significantly reduced by miR-1273g-3p (Figure
The glycolysis rate, as determined by measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) while measuring OCR, was also significantly decreased in miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing H4-APPswe cells (Figure
In miR-1273g-3p mimic-transfected H4-APPswe cells, the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2, was decreased; the pro-apoptotic genes, Bax and Bak, were significantly increased (Figure
To elucidate the function of miR-1273g-3p in neuronal cells, we analyzed the changes of mitochondrial function and BACE1 expression using neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.
In miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells stained with MitoTracker TM Red CMX Ros, the fluorescence intensity was decreased, the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria was considerably increased, and the number of cells with tubulated mitochondria was decreased (Figure
The basal and maximal OCR were decreased (Figure
This was associated with an inhibition of neurite outgrowth (Figure
Taken together, our results indicate that miR-1273g-3p is likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, and therefore an abnormal increase of miR-1273g-3p would disrupt mitochondrial functions leading to energy deprivation, oxidative stress, and eventual cell degeneration.

miR-1273g-3p Interacts with and Downregulates the Expression Levels of Mitochondrial Genes in H4-APPswe Cells
To identify the target genes of miR-1273g-3p, we pulled down mRNAs with biotinylated-miR-1273g-3p (biot-miR-1273g-3p) in H4-APPswe cells and profiled the mRNAs by highthroughput RNAseq (Figure
After pull-down of biot-miR-1273g-3p, we analyzed the level of miR-1273g-3p and the reference miRNAs, miR-191-5p and miR-16-5p, in the pulldown samples and supernatants by qPCR to confirm the efficiency and specificity of the experiment (Figure
RNAseq analysis of the pull-down samples identified 1539 genes whose mRNAs interacted with biot-miR-1273g-3p (Figure
GO analysis predicted 'mitochondrion' as the most enriched GO term, with 192 genes falling into this category (Figure
From among them, we used the p-values to select four mitochondrial genes for further analysis: GLRX5 (glutaredoxin 5), MTCH1 (mitochondrial carrier 1), VDAC2 (voltage dependent anion channel 2) and TIMM13 (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 13).
We verified their binding with miR-1273g-3p by qPCR analysis (Figure
cellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the intensity of CellROX Deep Red staining, which detects intracellular ROS, in miR-1273g-3p overexpressing H4-APPswe cells indicate that these cells are under oxidative stress (Figure
When we measured the levels of mRNAs encoding NRF2, SOD1/2 and ACO2, which are responsible for antioxidative stress, we found that miR-1273g-3p overexpression significantly decreased the levels of SOD1/2 (Figure
chondrial genes for further analysis: GLRX5 (glutaredoxin 5), MTCH1 (mitochondrial carrier 1), VDAC2 (voltage dependent anion channel 2) and TIMM13 (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 13).
We verified their binding with miR-1273g-3p by qPCR analysis (Figure
To confirm that miR-1273g-3p modulates the expression levels of these target genes by binding directly to their 3 UTRs, we constructed reporter vectors in which the 3 UTR sequences of GLRX5, MTCH1, VDAC2, and TIMM13 were inserted after the stop codon of the GFP gene.
TargetScan showed that the sequences of the 3 UTRs of MTCH1 and VDAC2 completely match the seed sequence of miR-1273g-3p, whereas GLRX5 and TIMM13 have one and three putative sequences, respectively, with partially matched bases.
Each putative target sequence was replaced with mismatched bases in mutant constructs (Figure
These reporter plasmids were co-transfected with miR-1273g-3p mimic or negative control into H4-APPswe cells.
The expression of GFP by the reporter vectors containing the WT 3 UTR sequences of GLRX5, MTCH1 and TIMM13 were markedly downregulated in the presence of miR-1273g-3p, whereas the expression of GFP by reporter vector containing the WT 3 UTR of VDAC2 was not (Figures
The miR-1273g-3p-mediated downregulation of GFP was completely abrogated by a mutation in the 3 UTR of MTCH1 and by a triple mutation in the 3 UTR of TIMM13, and was partially abrogated by a mutation in the 3 UTR of GLRX5 and by single mutations in the 3 UTR of TIMM13 (Figures
When miR-1273g-3p was overexpressed in H4-APPswe and SH-SY5Y cells, the protein expression levels of TIMM13, GLRX5, and MTCH1 were reduced whereas that of VDAC2 remained unchanged (Figure
Cell staining further confirmed the reduction of TIMM13 and GLRX5 expression by miR-1273g-3p in H4-APPswe (Figure
Transfection of various concentrations of miR-1273g-3p mimic into H4-APPswe cells dose-dependently downregulated TIMM13, GLRX5, and MTCH1 expression and increased JNK activation (Figure
These data support that miR-1273g-3p interacts with and negatively regulates various mitochondrial genes in both H4-APPswe and SH-SY5Y cells.

Modulation of the Expression of miR-1273g-3p Target Genes Affects Mitochondrial Function and Aβ42 Production
To further investigate the function of TIMM13, which was significantly downregulated in miR-1273g-3p-transfected H4-APPswe and SH-SY5Y cells, we used siRNA to knock down TIMM13 in H4-APPswe cells.
We found that TIMM13 knockdown moderately increased the levels of BACE1, p-JNK, and Aβ42 (Figure
Based on these data, we sought to overexpress TIMM13 in miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing H4-APPswe cells, in which TIMM13 expression was downregulated.
Indeed, we found that the overexpression of TIMM13 moderately restored BACE1 and Aβ42 production to the basal level in miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing H4-APPswe cells (Figure
The activation of JNK signaling by miR-1273g-3p was also relieved by the overexpression of TIMM13 (Figure
As we had found that treatment with an miR-1273g-3p inhibitor alleviated the increase of Aβ42 production in miR-1273g-3p-overexpressing H4-APPswe (see Figure
Western blot analyses revealed that the expression of GLRX5, MTCH1 and TIMM13, which were decreased by miR-1273g-3p overexpression, was recovered by miR-1273g-3p inhibitor in H4-APPswe cells (Figure
The maximum and ATP-linked OCR were also restored to the level seen in the negative control by co-transfection of the miR-1273g-3p inhibitor in H4-APPswe cells (Figure
Taken together, these data suggest that miR-1273g-3p regulates the expression levels of genes associated with mitochondrial function and in turn induces Aβ42 production.

TIMM13 Is Downregulated in Hippocampi of Human AD Patients
We analyzed the expression levels of three miR-1273g-3p target genes, GLRX5, MTCH1, and TIMM13, in brain tissues from AD patients using the GN367 and GN368 datasets of GeneNetwork (
accessed 29 April 2021).
The expression levels of three genes were significantly decreased in AD patients compared to controls (Figure
To confirm these findings, we analyzed TIMM13 expression by fluorescence immunohistochemistry in human hippocampus tissues obtained from 8 AD patients and 5 controls.
TIMM13 was abundantly expressed in normal brain, but was only faintly detected in the stratum pyramidal layers CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus in AD brains (Figure
Collectively, these data suggest that TIMM13 downregulation in AD brains is correlated with the pathogenesis of AD.

Discussion

Discussion
Most AD patients have sporadic AD, consisting of late onset AD that begins after age 65 years, rather than familial AD.
As the cause of sporadic AD has not yet been fully elucidated, it remains difficult to predict AD onset at early stage.
This is a problem, because early diagnosis and treatment can delay AD progression
Many studies have suggested that genetic mutations, such as those in APOE or TREM2, are closely associated with sporadic AD
Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs, have been also suggested as risk factors of sporadic AD
Owing to their essential role in fine-tuning gene expression, non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs, may be biomarkers of sporadic AD or even targets for treatment.
miR-29a/b-1 clusters and miR-132-3p, which regulate the expression of genes involved in APP processing and tau phosphorylation, were shown to be differentially expressed in postmortem brains of AD patients
To determine early miRNA markers, several studies profiled miRNAs in CSF or plasma from mild late onset AD or MCI patients
However, miRNAs are not yet considered to be reliable biomarkers for AD diagnosis because they have not yet been sufficiently analyzed in the early stage of AD, nor have functional analyses been performed in this context.
Using high-throughput analysis, the present study found that miR-1273g-3p is a novel AD-associated miRNA present in the plasma and CSF of individuals with PSAD who were presumed to be in the early stages of AD.
We then elucidated its cellular function in AD progression.
We found that miR-1273g-3p was constantly elevated in CSF of PSAD, PDAD, and AD patients compared to controls, and also showed significantly higher levels in plasma of AD patients (Figure
This finding is supported by a study showing that the level of mir-1273g, a precursor of miR-1273g-3p, is one of miRNAs increased in blood from AD patients
To our knowledge, however, no study has investigated the role of miR-1273g-3p in AD pathogenesis.
In addition, our results are considered reliable due to the use of accurate AD diagnosis through amyloid-PET imaging and assessment of AD risk factors, and reproducibility across the three cohorts.
We suggest that CSF miR-1273g-3p could be a good biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.
However, we would need to establish a standard protocol for normalizing miRNA levels in plasma and CSF, prior to using miR-1273g-3p as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis.
Also, longitudinal observation should be conducted to determine whether PSAD and/or PDAD patients progress to AD, as this could be a key to accurately diagnose cognitively normal but Aβ-positive people as potential AD patients.
We used a pull-down assay to determine the function of miR-1273g-3p, and identified 1539 miR-1273g-3p-interacting transcripts with significant binding values in H4-APPswe cells.
GO analysis predicted that this gene set is primarily involved in mitochondrial function.
Among the 192 transcripts of mitochondrial genes found to interact with miR-1273g-3p, we confirmed that functional interactions occurred with GLRX5, MTCH1 and TIMM13 (Figure
In both H4-APPswe and SH-SY5Y cells, miR-1273g-3p expression had the greatest decreasing effect on TIMM13, which is known to import and insert certain proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane, such as SLC25A12 and TIMM23 in complex with TIMM8
The mechanisms by which TIMM13 regulates mitochondrial function have not been fully elucidated.
However, it is known that the neurodegenerative disease, Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome, occurs due to a mutation in TIMM8A, which acts as a complex with TIMM13, suggesting its association with neurodegenerative disease
Knockdown of TIMM13 alone was associated with significant increases in JNK activation, BACE1 expression, and Aβ production and TIMM13 expression tended to be downregulated in the post-mortem AD brain.
Overexpression of TIMM13 and inhibition of miR-1273g-3p in miR-1273g-3p-transfected cells restored the increased BACE1 expression and Aβ production to basal levels.
These observations suggested that enhanced mitochondrial function could be helpful to prevent AD progression.
This finding is supported by a previous report that the upregulation of various mitochondrial genes responsible for the mitochondrial stress response could rescue Aβ toxicity in AD model cell lines and AD model animals, including mouse and C. elegans
Among the genes that interact with miR-1273g-3p, genes with the GO terms "RNA binding", "RNA splicing" and "poly(A) RNA binding", which show high significance, should not be overlooked to more fully understand the function of miR-1273g-3p.
RNA binding proteins are essential for the regulation of gene expression through various RNA processing pathways, such as alternative polyadenylation (APA).
In particular, the untranslated region (UTR)-APA has a definite impact on the function of miRNAs
Among the miR-1273g-3p-interacting genes associated with RNA processing, RPL23 is a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 60S subunit, and PIN4 encodes a ribosomal RNA processing factor
We found that, although VDAC2 significantly interacted with miR-1273g-3p, the expression of VDAC2 was unaffected by miR-1273g-3p overexpression.
This unexpected result may have been due to the change in expression of factors that participate in RNA processing pathways, or to other regulatory factors.
Although the functions of these miR-1273g-3p-interacting genes were not fully elucidated in the present study, we speculate that their changes may contribute to AD onset by triggering irreversible mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent cell degeneration.
Accumulated evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction might be a primary factor in AD development
Various factors have been proposed to induce mitochondrial dysfunction in AD progression.
In particular, Aβ is reported to accumulate and inhibit peptide turnover in mitochondria, activate mitochondrial fission proteins, and eventually induce apoptosis
In addition, defects in calcium signaling or neuroinflammation can impair mitochondrial function in AD
However, the mechanism impairing mitochondria in AD have not yet been clearly identified, and AD remains a complex, multifactorial, and irreversible disease.
Many recent studies have reported that various miRNAs can regulate mitochondrial activities in AD.
For example, miR-34a, which is enhanced in brains of AD patients, targets mitochondrial genes (e.g., NDUFC2 and UQCRB) to reduce ATP production and glycolytic capacity
miR-195 is elevated in hippocampus and targets mitofusin2, and its overexpression triggered the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in the senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 mouse model
Interestingly, miR-375, the level of which was increased in aMCI patients, as shown by our microarray data, was also reported to regulate mitochondrial function.
The expression of miR-375 was increased in Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells and AD patients, and the inhibition of its expression alleviated oxidative stress injury and the apoptosis of Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells
In addition, miR-375 promoted mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis
Here, we report that miR-1273g-3p is increased in AD, and that increased miR-1273g-3p induces mitochondrial dysfunction to affect Aβ production.
The previous and present findings therefore collectively suggest that the accumulation of dysregulated miRNAs caused by various stimuli might negatively affect homeostasis in brain and thereby cause irreversible brain degeneration.
A limitation of the present study is that the altered expression of miR-1273g-3p has not been directly confirmed in brain tissues of AD patients.
The level of miR-1273g-3p has been reported to be increased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stressed by acute glucose fluctuation
miR-1273g-3p can also affect megakaryocyte differentiation by regulating cyclin and cyclin dependent kinases
Although analysis of the TissueAtlas database (
accessed 10 August 2021) predicted that miR-1273g-3p is highly expressed in brain tissue, no experimental evidence to date has shown that miR-1273g-3p is expressed in brain cells, and we were unable to identify the cells that express and secrete miR-1273g-3p into the CSF and blood of AD patients.
Nevertheless, this study showed that in AD patients miR-1273g-3p is significantly increased in CSF, which is in direct contact with brain parenchyma, as well as showing the functions of miR-1273g-3p in two types of brain cell line, H4-APPswe (neuroglioma) and SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma) cells.
miRNAs can regulate gene expression not only in cells that express miRNAs but in other cells by secretion and uptake
These findings suggest that miR-1273g-3p could affect various brain-derived cell types via paracrine or endocrine as well as autocrine effects.
In conclusion, we herein report that miR-1273g-3p is increased at an early stage of AD, and that this AD-related upregulation of miR-1273g-3p induced mitochondrial dysfunction by targeting various mitochondrial genes to facilitate Aβ production and neurodegeneration.
Thus, miR-1273g-3p might be a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD and a potential therapeutic target for AD progression.
