Introduction
Down syndrome (DS), the most common form of intellectual disability, arises from total or partial triplication of chromosome 21.
As one of the critical risk factors for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), trisomy 21 not only increases amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene dosage but also promotes the amyloidogenic pathway in the AD human brain by altering APP processing (1-3) and amyloid plaque deposition in the AD mouse brain
In addition to APP and BACE2, it remains to be determined whether other genes on chromosome 21 also contribute to AD pathology in DS
By 40 years of age, almost all individuals with DS exhibit AD neuropathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
Moreover, approximately two-thirds of patients with DS develop clinical Alzheimer's dementia by 60 years of age
As the major pathological hallmark of AD, amyloid plaques consist of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ), a peptide originating from sequential APP proteolysis by β secretase BACE1 and γ secretase
Cumulative evidence indicates that aggregation of Aβ peptides in vulnerable brain regions is the trigger for tau pathology and gliosis/neuroinflammation. Thus, Aβ targeting may comprise key disease-modifying strategies to treat or prevent AD progression
The ubiquitin-specific protease USP25 is encoded by a gene located at 21q11.2.
As a negative regulator of IL-17-mediated inflammation, USP25 plays a vital role in innate immunity
Previously, we found that USP25 regulates microglial homeostasis and neuroinflammation during neurodegeneration
However, it is still unknown whether and how triplication of USP25 in the DS brain contributes to AD-like neuropathological features, such as amyloid deposition.
Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is one of the critical risk factors for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), implicating key roles for chromosome 21-encoded genes in the pathogenesis of AD.
We previously identified a role for the deubiquitinase USP25, encoded on chromosome 21, in regulating microglial homeostasis in the AD brain; however, whether USP25 affects amyloid pathology remains unknown.
Here, by crossing 5×FAD AD and Dp16 DS mice, we observed that trisomy 21 exacerbated amyloid pathology in the 5×FAD brain.
Moreover, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene-mediated USP25 overexpression increased amyloid deposition in the 5×FAD mouse brain, whereas genetic deletion of Usp25 reduced amyloid deposition.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that USP25 promoted β cleavage of APP and Aβ generation by reducing the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of both APP and BACE1.
Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP25 ameliorated amyloid pathology in the 5×FAD mouse brain.
In summary, we identified the DS-related gene USP25 as a critical regulator of AD pathology, and our data suggest that USP25 serves as a potential pharmacological target for AD drug development.
USP25 inhibition ameliorates Alzheimer's pathology through the regulation of APP processing and Aβ generation artificial chromosome-Tg-USP25 (BAC-Tg-USP25) mice (Supplemental Figure
We performed immunostaining using hippocampal sections from 6-month-old 5×FAD and 5×FAD;BAC-Tg-USP25 mice and observed an increased number of amyloid plaques in the hippocampi of 5×FAD;BAC-Tg-USP25 mice compared with the hippocampi of 5×FAD mice (Figure
This suggests that USP25 upregulation alone can sufficiently aggravate Aβ pathology.
Genetic deletion of Usp25 ameliorates amyloid pathology in AD mice.
Usp25 -/-mice displayed normal body weight and cognitive behavior compared with their WT littermates (Supplemental Figure
We generated 5×FAD;Usp25 +/- mice by crossing Usp25 +/-mice with 5×FAD mice.
We evaluated the learning and memory ability of 5×FAD;Usp25 +/-mice and found that genetic deletion of Usp25 improved the cognitive performance of 5×FAD mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) test (Figure
We subsequently performed histological analysis of amyloid plaques in cortical and hippocampal sections from 6-month-old 5×FAD and 5×FAD;Usp25 +/-mice.
Staining with both an Aβ antibody and thioflavin S revealed a reduction in amyloid burden in 5×FAD;Usp25 +/-mice compared with 5×FAD mice (Figure
We next analyzed the levels of soluble Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 in mouse cortical and hippocampal lysates by ELISA and found that genetic deletion of Usp25 markedly reduced soluble Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels in the 5×FAD;Usp25 +/-mouse hippocampus and cortex at 6 months of age (Figure
Furthermore, we performed Golgi staining in cortical sections from 9-month-old WT, Usp25 +/-, 5×FAD, and 5×FAD;Usp25 +/- Here, we demonstrate that triplication of chromosome 21 genes exacerbated AD-related amyloid pathology in 5×FAD mice.
Moreover, overexpression of chromosome 21-encoded USP25 markedly increased amyloid deposition, whereas Usp25 deficiency ameliorated amyloid pathology by regulating APP processing and Aβ generation in 5×FAD mice.
Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of USP25 markedly attenuated amyloid plaque burden in 5×FAD mice.
Therefore, our results identify a critical role for ubiquitin-proteasome system signaling in the regulation of amyloid deposition and a potentially novel strategy for ameliorating the neuropathology of AD.

Results
Increased USP25 gene dosage aggravates amyloid pathology in AD mice.
To address whether trisomy 21 influences AD pathogenesis, we generated a combined murine DS-AD model by crossing the 5×FAD AD model with the Dp16 DS mouse model, and immunoblot analyses confirmed an upregulation of USP25, APP, and APP-carboxy-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) in the cortices of 5×FAD; Dp16 mice compared with that of 5×FAD mice (Supplemental Figure
We subsequently immunostained hippocampal sections from 5-month-old 5×FAD and 5×FAD;Dp16 mice and found that overdosage of chromosome 21 genes enhanced amyloid plaque deposition in the 5×FAD;Dp16 mouse brain (Figure
USP25, which resides on chromosome 21, has been previously shown to regulate neuroinflammation in the DS-AD brain
To determine whether USP25 affects amyloid pathology in the context of DS-AD, we crossed 5×FAD mice with bacterial  USP25 promotes BACE1 deubiquitination and APP β cleavage.
To determine the underlying molecular mechanism by which USP25 regulates APP processing and Aβ generation, we further verified the interaction between USP25 and APP (Figure
We found that USP25 overexpression reduced the amount of polyubiquitinated APP (Figure
Furthermore, we demonstrated that USP25 depletion-mediated APP and BACE1 degradation can be reversed by inhibition of both the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways (Figure
Furthermore, we performed sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation and found that USP25 overexpression increased the subcellular accumulation of BACE1 in the Golgi apparatus (Figure
To further confirm the effect of USP25 on BACE1 trafficking, we performed a biotinylation assay to isolate the plasma membrane and found that USP25 overexpression markedly reduced the cell surface BACE1 distribution (Figure
Further immunostaining analyses revealed an increase in the sorting of BACE1 into the RCAS1-positive Golgi apparatus and colocalization of BACE1 with APP upon overexpression of USP25 (Figure
Together, our results identified APP and BACE1 as USP25 substrates and demonstrated that trafficking/processing of these components can be regulated by USP25-mediated deubiquitination.
Pharmacological inhibition of USP25 ameliorates amyloid pathology in AD mice.
We took advantage of an in vitro enzymatic activity mice and observed deficits in dendritic spines in 5×FAD mice and restoration of mature spine density and spine size in 5×FAD;Usp25 +/-mice compared with 5×FAD mice (Figure
Together, these results demonstrate that Usp25 downregulation or deletion haploinsufficiency ameliorates amyloid pathology and synaptic deficits in 5×FAD mice.
USP25 modulates amyloidogenic APP processing in vivo and in vitro.
The generation of Aβ is derived from sequential cleavage of the transmembrane precursor APP by β and γ secretases
To determine whether reduced amyloid deposition with USP25 downregulation is derived from changes in APP processing, we characterized the expression of various proteolytic readouts from APP-processing pathways by immunoblot analysis.
We found that Usp25 deficiency reduced the levels of APP and its cleavage products (both α-and β-CTFs) in the cortices of 6-month-old 5×FAD;Usp25 +/-mice (Figure
Consistent with these results in vivo, we found that USP25 knockdown markedly reduced the levels of secreted and intracellular Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 in the human APP-overexpressing SH-SY5Y-APP 751 cell line (Figure
Moreover, knockdown of USP25 reduced the expression of APP, APP-CTFs, sAP-Pβ, and BACE1 but not PS1-CTF (Figure
In addition, overexpression of USP25 increased APP protein levels in APP-overexpressing HEK293T cells (Supplemental Figure
Inhibition of lysosomal degradation by leupeptin abolished the effects of USP25 overexpression on APP, indicating that USP25 affects APP turnover (Supplemental Figure
We also found that overexpression of USP25 increased BACE1 expression, while overexpression of ubiquitin decreased BACE1 protein levels (Supplemental Figure

Discussion
Because it is a major protein degradation pathway in all cell types, dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system results in various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, DS, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease
Here, we confirmed that triplication of chromosome 21 genes aggravated AD-related amyloid pathology in a DS-AD mouse model.
We found that, in addition to perturbing microglial homeostasis, USP25 plays a role in amyloid deposition by regulating APP processing and Aβ generation.
Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of USP25 reversed amyloid pathology in 5×FAD mice, suggesting that USP25 inhibition could be an effective strategy for alleviating amyloid deposition in the AD brain (Figure

Ubiquitination at APP Lys 763 sequesters APP assay using a purified recombinant USP25 catalytic domain with a fluorogenic substrate consisting of ubiquitin derived at the C-terminus with rhodamine-110
Further immunoblot analyses confirmed that AZ1 administration reduced the protein amounts of APP and APP-CTFs in the cortices of 5×FAD mice compared with the vehicle controls (Supplemental Figure
To evaluate the effects of USP25 inhibition on amyloid deposition in vivo, we intraperitoneally injected 5×FAD mice with the USP25 inhibitor AZ1 (20 mg/kg/d, daily injection, 28 days) (Figure
We subsequently performed histological analysis and found a reduction in the number of amyloid plaques in brain sections from AZ1-injected 5×FAD mice compared with those from 5×FAD mice administered solvent (Figure
Consistent with the reduction in amyloid plaques, AZ1 administration also resulted in a decrease in both LAMP1-and ATG9A-positive dystrophic neurites (Figure
These results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of USP25 ameliorated amyloid burden in the AD mouse model.
USP25 expression correlates with AD pathology in the human AD brain.
We examined USP25 expression in postmortem brain samples from individuals with AD and age-matched controls and found that USP25 protein levels remained unchanged in patients with sporadic AD compared with controls without AD; here, the synaptic marker synaptophysin was used as a control (Figure
However, we further performed Spearman's correlation analysis and found a positive correlation between the amounts of USP25 and APP/BACE1/Aβ 42 in the cortices of patients with in the Golgi apparatus and inhibits the maturation and proteolytic processing of APP
Moreover, ubiquitination of BACE1 at the C-terminus of Lys 501 led to the accumulation of BACE1 in late endosomes/lysosomes and thereby lysosomal degradation
Here, we identified that USP25 deubiquitinates and prevents the lysosomal degradation of APP and BACE1.
Moreover, USP25 facilitates the sorting of BACE1 into the Golgi apparatus.
BACE1 is predominantly localized in endosomes and the late Golgi/trans-Golgi network (late Golgi/TGN); the low pH of endosomes and late Golgi/TGN allows for optimal cleavage activity of β secretase.
Therefore, BACE1 trafficking into the Golgi apparatus enhances β cleavage of APP and Aβ production.
We previously found that the overdosage of USP25 induced microglia-mediated synapse elimination and neuroinflammation by deubiquitinating ATP6V0C and WDFY1 in the DS-AD brain
In the current study, we identified a role for neuronal USP25 in regulating APP processing and Aβ generation.
Because USP25 can affect AD pathogenesis by influencing multiple cell types in the central nervous system, future studies characterizing the effects of conditional Usp25 deletion in neurons are required to determine the cell type-specific effects of USP25 on amyloid deposition and other AD-related neurological phenotypes.
Although USP25 protein levels remain unchanged in patients with AD compared with controls without AD, more attention should be given to the catalytic activity of USP25, a ubiquitin-specific protease, and future studies will carefully characterize the regulatory mechanism of USP25 catalytic activity in the brain in the context of AD and related disorders.
Moreover, to determine the genetic association between USP25 and AD pathogenesis, future genetic studies should identify key single nucleotide polymorphisms in the USP25 gene in patients with AD.
In summary, our findings revealed that DS-related USP25 plays a role in AD-related amyloid pathology by modulating APP

A previous study demonstrated that trisomy 21 enhances Aβ plaque deposition independently of an extra copy of APP in a combined murine DS-AD model (J20×Tc1; ref. 4).
In addition to APP, other genes and noncoding RNAs on chromosome 21 could also contribute to DS-AD neuropathology, such as BACE2 (23), CTSB (24), DYRK1A (25), ETS2 (26), RCAN1 (27), SUMO3 (28), and miR-155 (29).
Our findings confirmed the pivotal role of USP25 in the regulation of Aβ generation and APP processing.

n = 5 mice per group.
(G) Representative immunostaining of 6E10-positive amyloid plaques and LAMP1-positive dystrophic neurites in the hippocampi of 5×FAD+vehicle and 5×FAD+AZ1 mice.
Scale bar: 100 μm (merge); 20 μm (Zoom in).
(H) Quantification of LAMP1-positive dystrophic neurites in G. n = 5 mice per group.
(I) Quantification of amyloid plaque-associated LAMP1-positive dystrophic neurites in G. n = 5 mice and 55 amyloid plaques (5×FAD+Veh), n = 5 mice and 47 amyloid plaques (5×FAD+AZ1).
Data are presented as mean ± SEM (C-F and H) or median with minimum to maximum bars (I).
P values were determined by Student's t test in C-F and by the Mann-Whitney test in H, I, K, and L. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.


Co-IP was performed as previously described
The following antibodies were used: anti-HA (Sigma-Aldrich, H6908, 1:200), anti-His (Proteintech, 66005-1-Ig, 1:200), isotype rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-3888, 1:200), and isotype mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2025, 1:200).
A previously described anti-APP rabbit polyclonal antibody RU-369 (1:200; ref. 42) was used.Subcellular fractionation.
Cells were harvested in 1 mL PBS, centrifuged at 1000g for 60 seconds and resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose [8.56%], and protease inhibitor cocktail).
The collected cells were homogenized with 15 strokes of a Kontes Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1000g for 15 minutes to produce a postnuclear supernatant (PNS).
PNS was loaded on top of a decreasing sucrose gradient consisting of 0.8 mL 2 M, 1.2 mL 1.3 M, 1.2 mL 1.0 M, and 0.8 mL 0.5 M sucrose in HB.
Tubes were balanced and spun at 280,000g for 2 hours at 4°C.
Nuclei and intact cells were precipitated in pellets by low-speed centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes.
Samples were manually collected from the top of the tube, concentrated by TCA/acetone protein precipitation, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Figure 9. Targeting USP25 ameliorates amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's brains.
USP25 interacts with and deubiquitinates APP and BACE1 in the Golgi apparatus, resulting in amyloid pathology.
Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of USP25 induces lysosomal degradation of APP and BACE1 and reverses amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's brains.
