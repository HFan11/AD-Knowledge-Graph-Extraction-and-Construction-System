Metabolic profiling of neocortical tissue discriminates Alzheimer’s disease from mild cognitive impairment, high pathology controls, and normal controls
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for an estimated 60 to 80% of cases, and is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States.
While considerable advancements have been made in the clinical care of AD, it remains a complicated disorder that can be di cult to identify de nitively in its earliest stages.
Recently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics has shown signi cant potential for elucidation of disease mechanisms and identi cation of therapeutic targets as well diagnostic and prognostic markers that may be useful in resolving some of the di culties affecting clinical AD studies, such as effective strati cation.
In this study, complementary gas chromatography-and liquid chromatography-MS platforms were used to detect and monitor 2,080 metabolites and features in 48 post-mortem tissue samples harvested from the superior frontal gyrus of male and female subjects.
Samples were taken from four groups: 12 normal control (NC) patients, 12 cognitively normal subjects characterized as high pathology controls (HPC), 12 subjects with non-speci c mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 12 subjects with AD.
Multivariate statistics informed the construction and cross-validation (p < 0.01) of partial least squaresdiscriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models de ned by a 9-metabolite panel of disease markers (lauric acid, stearic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and four unidenti ed mass spectral features).
Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed high predictive accuracy of the resulting PLS-DA models for discrimination of NC (97%), HPC (92%), MCI (~ 96%), and AD (~ 96%) groups.
Pathway analysis revealed signi cant disturbances in lysine degradation, fatty acid metabolism, and the degradation of branched-chain amino acids.
Network analysis showed signi cant enrichment of 11 enzymes, predominantly within the mitochondria.
The results expand basic knowledge of the metabolome related to AD and reveal pathways that can be targeted therapeutically.
This study also provides a promising basis for the development of larger multisite projects to validate these candidate markers in readily available biospecimens such as blood to enable the effective screening, rapid diagnosis, accurate surveillance, and therapeutic monitoring of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked primarily by cognitive decline and dementia
AD is the most common cause of adult dementia, accounting for 60 to 80% of cases worldwide
Currently, AD affects more than 5.8 million Americans
In the United States, total payments in 2020 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services are estimated to be $305 billion
Consequently, AD represents a signi cant threat to human health and exerts a substantial nancial and societal impact.
Considerable advancements have been made in the ability to accurately diagnose AD, largely owing to the development of positron emission tomography (PET) scans for detection of plaques and tangles, as well as cerebral spinal uid (CSF) and plasma tests for AD-associated biomarkers
However, treatment of patients and appropriate evaluation of the outcomes of clinical studies remain complicated by the many unknowns involved in AD.
Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be in the early stages of AD or may be affected by an unrelated disease process, confounding studies of early interventional treatments.
In addition, some individuals with intermediate levels of AD-associated pathology (plaques and tangles) do not display cognitive de cits
It is also common for AD to be found in conjunction with other pathologies such as synucleinopathy, TDP-43, or microinfarcts
Therefore, the ability to more effectively stratify and subgroup individuals would likely produce clearer and more actionable results.
Furthermore, provisional diagnosis relies on a combination of mental status testing, neuropsychological tests, interviews with friends and family, laboratory tests, and various brain imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), and PET
These conventional diagnostic methods show low speci city against other dementias (70%) and only moderate sensitivity (80%)
Additionally, these criteria are unable to capture early brain pathology that may predate symptoms by as much as 30 years
Consequently, there is a critical need for highly sensitive and speci c markers of AD that may enable early disease detection as well as identi cation of potential drug targets, improved prognosis, and monitoring of therapeutic response.
A growing body of evidence suggests that perturbations in various metabolic pathways play a signi cant role in AD
Most notably, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis states that widespread mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction is a strong characteristic of AD and plays a role in the accumulation of Aβ plaques
Furthermore, studies have also shown fatty acids to play an important role in AD pathology, exerting both protective and pathogenic effects
Alterations in glycerophospholipid
Metabolomics, the scienti c study of metabolic composition and pathways present in biological systems, has facilitated the accurate characterization of various metabolomes for advances in disease classi cation, drug therapy, and biomarker discovery [16-18].
More speci cally, mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical approach in metabolomics that allows for the accurate detection and quanti cation of metabolites in biological samples
Various forms of untargeted and targeted MS-based metabolomic assays have been implemented in an attempt to pro le biochemical processes in AD pathology.
Methods mainly include direct infusion-MS
The current study employs hyphenated MS-based assays that combine both targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to detect aqueous metabolites, lipids, fatty acids, and bile acids, in addition to pro ling unidenti ed features.
A total of 2,080 metabolites/features were detected in 48 samples of superior frontal gyrus tissue taken from four groups of patients: normal control (NC), high pathology controls (HPC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD.
Multivariate signi cance testing and model estimation constructed cross-validated partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) models con ned to a highly predictive 9-metabolite panel of potential biomarkers capable of distinguishing each clinical group with high sensitivity and speci city.
In conjunction with pathway and enrichment analyses, the current study corroborates ndings of previous literature and adds to basic knowledge of the metabolome related to neurodegenerative decline as well as the behavioral symptoms of AD-induced dementia; this study offers a large-scale analysis of molecular alterations associated with AD pathogenesis and progression, potentially supporting future drug development and prevention efforts.
Importantly, this study provides clinically relevant candidate biomarkers capable of accurate post-mortem classi cation which may, eventually, prove useful to in vivo diagnosis and disease monitoring.

Standard compounds corresponding to measured aqueous metabolites/features were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Fisher Scienti c. Lipid standards were purchased from Fisher Scienti c, Sigma-Aldrich, and Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

Clinical samples
Frozen tissue from the superior frontal gyrus of male and female subjects was obtained from the Arizona

Targeted LC-MS/MS aqueous pro ling
For tissue lysates, 400 mg pieces of frozen superior frontal gyrus were hand homogenized in 400 µL of ice-cold sterile PBS containing a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt, Thermo Scienti c).
Three samples for which less tissue was available were homogenized in equal ratios (weight to volume) of the PBS/inhibitor solution.
Homogenized samples were sonicated on ice in a biosafety cabinet at a 40% amplitude for a total time of 1 min, with alternating on/off sequences of 15 sec.
Samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 x g at 4 o C. The supernatant and pellets were stored separately at -80 o C until analysis.
Prior to LC-MS/MS targeted measurement, frozen tissue supernatant samples were rst thawed overnight under 4 °C.
Afterward, 50 µL of each sample were placed in a 2 mL Eppendorf vial.
The initial step for protein precipitation and metabolite extraction was performed by adding 500 µL MeOH and 50 µL internal standard solution (containing 1,810.5 µM 13 C 3 -lactate and 142 µM 13 C 5 -glutamic acid).
The mixture was then vortexed for 10 s and stored at -20 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 10 min at 4 °C.
The supernatants (450 µL) were collected into new Eppendorf vials and dried using a CentriVap Concentrator.
The dried samples were reconstituted in 150 µL of 40% PBS/60% ACN and centrifuged again at 14,000 RPM at 4 °C for 10 min.
Afterward, 100 µL of supernatant was collected from each sample into an LC autosampler vial for subsequent analysis.
A pooled sample, which was a mixture of all experimental samples, was used as the quality control (QC) sample and injected once every 10 experimental samples.
The targeted LC-MS/MS method used here was modeled after that developed and used in a growing number of studies
Brie y, all LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on an Agilent 1290 UPLC-6490 QQQ-MS system.
Each supernatant sample was injected twice, 10 µL for analysis using negative ionization mode and 4 µL for analysis using positive ionization mode.
Both chromatographic separations were performed in hydrophilic interaction chromatography mode on a Waters XBridge BEH Amide column (150 × 2.1 mm, 2.5 µm particle size, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA).
The ow rate was 0.  for LC-MS/MS targeted lipidomics analysis, while the remaining 20 µL was pooled to create a QC sample.
For lipidomic pro ling, all mass spectrometry experiments were done on an Agilent 1290 LC-6490 QQQ-MS (Santa Clara, CA), and 4 µL was injected for positive ionization, whereas 6 µL was used in negative ion mode injections.
Both modes used reverse phase chromatography with a Waters XSelect HSS T3 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 2.5 µm particle size; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA).
The ow rate through the column was maintained at 0.3 mL/min.
The mobile phase Solvent A was composed of 10 mM NH 4 OAc in 60% H2O/ 40% ACN.
Solvent B consisted of 10 mM NH 4 OAc in 90% IPA/10% ACN.
An isocratic elution was used with 50% Solvent B for 3 min before its percentage was gradually increased to 100% over the next 12 min.
Following 10 min of continued 100% Solvent B, at t = 25 min, the percent of B was decreased gradually back to 50% to prepare for the next sample injection.
The set of lipids covered in our LC-MS/MS lipidomics assay were the same as those in our previous study, and 357 lipids were selected from various lipid classes including fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, etc
Lipid standards were used to test the MRM and retention time (RT) for each individual lipid.
Untargeted GC-MS aqueous pro ling
The aqueous bottom layer (180 µL) from the MTBE extraction described above was collected into a new Eppendorf tube for derivatization prior to untargeted metabolic pro ling with GC-MS.
The collected bottom layer was dried under vacuum at 37ºC for 4 h using a CentriVap Concentrator (Labconco, Fort Scott, KS).
The residues were rst derivatized with 40 µL of 20 mg/mL MeOX solution in pyridine under 60ºC for 90 min.
Next, 60 µL of MTBSTFA containing d 27 -mysristic acid were added, and the mixture was incubated at 60ºC for 30 min.
The samples were then vortexed for 30 sec, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 10 min.
Finally, 70 µL of supernatant were collected from each sample into new glass vials for GC-MS analysis.
GC-MS conditions used here were mainly adopted from previous studies
Brie y, GC-MS experiments were performed on an Agilent 7820A GC-5977B MSD system (Santa Clara, CA) by injecting 1 µL of prepared samples.
Helium was used as the carrier gas with a constant ow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
The separation of metabolites was achieved using an Agilent HP-5 ms capillary column (30 m x 250 µm x 0.25 µm).
The column temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 1 min, increased at a rate of 10 °C/min to 325 °C, and then held at this temperature for 10 min.
Mass spectral signals were recorded at an m/z range of 50-600.
Data extraction was performed using Agilent MassHunter Pro nder software.
A batch recursive feature extraction algorithm for small molecules was used, and peaks were ltered so that only peaks with absolute height ≥ 1,000 counts were included.
An RT tolerance of 0.10 min was established, and extraction was limited to the largest 1,000 compound groups.
Results were ltered if the overall identi cation score was less than 75.

Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs)
Weighed 20 mg samples were added to separate Eppendorf tubes and prepared using the same protocol as that outlined for LC-MS/MS lipidomics.
Derivatization was performed using the same protocol as that outlined for GC-MS untargeted pro ling.
For analysis of LCFAs, 60 µL of supernatant was transferred to a glass vial for GC-MS analysis, while 20 µL was pooled from each sample for QC analysis.
GC-MS method was the same as that for GC-MS untargeted pro ling.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
Frozen tissue samples were rst thawed overnight under 4 °C.
Afterward, 20 mg of each sample was homogenized with 5 µL hexanoic acid-3,3,3 (internal standard), 15 µL sodium hydroxide (NaOH [0.5 M]), and 500 µL methanol (MeOH).
Following storage at -20 °C for 20 min and centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 10 min, 450 µL of supernatant were collected and sample pH was adjusted to 10 by adding 30 µL of NaOH:H 2 O (1:4, v:v).
Samples were then dried, and they were measured using the same protocol as that outlined for GC-MS untargeted pro ling.

Bile acids
Sample preparation techniques used here are well established and described in the previous literature
Samples were stored at - 20 °C for 20 min, followed by sonication in an ice bath for 10 min and then centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 15 min at 4 °C.
Supernatants (450 µL) were vacuum dried and then reconstituted in 100 µL MeOH/H 2 O (1:1, v/ v).
Each prepared sample (2 µL) was injected into the LC-MS system (Agilent 1290 UPLC-6490 QQQ-MS) for analysis using negative ionization mode.
The mobile phase was composed of 5 mM NH 4 OAc in H 2 O with 0.1% AcOH (A) and ACN with 0.1% AcOH (B).
After a 1 min of isocratic elution of 75% Solvent A, the content percentage decreased to 5% A at t = 15 min.
The composition of Solvent A was then maintained at 5% for 10 min, followed by an increase to 75% at t = 25 min.
The MS parameters were the same as those reported for targeted LC-MS/MS aqueous pro ling, except that 55 bile acids were included in the detection panel.
Samples were spiked with mixtures of standard compounds in order to validate bile acid identities.

Data analysis
Following peak integration, data were normalized by tissue weight and lysate volume as appropriate.
The data were log 10 -transformed and Pareto scaled prior to model construction.
Univariate testing was performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Multivariate statistical analyses were performed using open-source R software.
Pathway and integrating enzyme enrichment analysis were performed and visualized using MetaboAnalyst v4.0

Clinical characteristics
A total of 48 subjects were included in this study: NC (n = 12), HPC (n = 12), MCI (n = 12), and AD (n = 12).
Table
Between AD patients and controls, subjects were age-and sex-matched such that no statistically signi cant difference was observed between groups (p > 0.05).
Principal component analysis (PCA) conducted with all reliably detected metabolites between all groups was performed, and 95% con dence intervals were evaluated for potential outliers.
The initial PCA revealed one outlier (sample 13, HPC subject), and this sample was therefore removed from subsequent analyses.
Tangle score 11,0,0,0 † 9,3,0,0 5,6,1,0 0,2,1,9

Case (MCI, AD) vs control (NC, HPC)
To assess broad differences in metabolic pro les, groups were collapsed among case (MCI and AD) and control (NC and HPC).
Initial t-testing between case and control revealed two highly signi cant and predictive metabolites with p < 0.001 and univariate area under curve (AUC) > 0.90: lauric acid and myristic acid.
Box plots of these metabolites are given in Supporting Information Figure
In addition, a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was constructed using levels of lauric and myristic acid, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted using model-implied values to assess performance.
As shown in Fig.

NC/HPC vs other groups
To analyze differences among groups individually, we rst compared metabolic pro les of NC vs HPC/MCI/AD, and HPC vs NC/MCI/AD.
Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) testing and associated post-hoc comparisons were performed.
As outlined in Table
Normalized box plots of these metabolites between all groups are shown in Fig.
More than 98% of total variance between the four study groups was explained by the rst two components, and permutation testing revealed the model to be statistically sound.
To assess the predictive performance of this uni ed biomarker panel, the resulting PLS-DA model was subjected to ROC analysis with 100-fold LOOCV.
ROC curves for each comparison are provided in Supporting Information Figure
Evaluation of model accuracy showed high classi cation performance for discrimination of NC samples (96.6%, Figure

MCI vs other groups
In an effort to increase model performance for discrimination of the MCI subgroup (see Supporting
Information Figure
Comparison of MCI and NC groups revealed lauric acid to be both highly signi cant (p < 0.001) and predictive (AUC = 0.993) (Supporting Information Figure
Comparison of MCI and HPC groups revealed four metabolites (myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitoleic acid) to have AUC > 0.90 and FDR q < 0.05 (Fig.
Candidate metabolites for the classi cation of MCI and HPC samples were used to construct an independent PLS-DA model, while candidate markers for MCI discrimination from AD samples were ported to construct a separate PLS-DA model.
ROC analysis showed a predictive accuracy of 96.6% for the identi cation of MCI samples from high pathology controls (Fig.
Meanwhile, ROC analysis of the PLS-DA model constructed using levels of four unidenti ed features with an average AUC ~ 0.811 showed an appreciable improvement in accuracy relative to each univariate AUC; classi cation accuracy of the PLS-DA model exhibited an AUC = 0.917 for discrimination of MCI and AD groups (Fig.

AD vs other groups
Relevant groups were also compared to AD samples for enhanced identi cation of disease.
Univariate ROC analysis and independent samples t-testing of NC and AD samples showed lauric acid to be highly signi cant (p < 0.001) and predictive (AUC > 0.99) (see Supporting Information Figure
For classi cation of AD samples from high pathology controls, t-testing revealed the uni ed biomarker panel in Fig.
Direct comparisons between AD and HPC groups for these metabolites are visualized as box plots in Supporting Information Figure
For discrimination of these groups, an additional PLS-DA model was constructed using the aforementioned candidate markers, and ROC analysis revealed high predictive accuracy (94.8%) for discrimination of AD and HPC samples (Fig.

Correlation analysis of candidate markers and clinical/neuropathological characteristics
To assess relevant associations between the set of candidate markers and measures of brain pathology and disease progression, a correlation analysis was performed, and measures of association strength and signi cance were evaluated.
A visualization of association strength between correlation variables is given in Fig.
Full details regarding magnitude of association (r) and signi cance of association (p) can be found in Supporting Information Table
In total, 4 associations had r > 0.5 or < -0.5 and p < 0.05.
Lauric acid showed strong, signi cant associations with frontal plaque (r = -0.598,
p < 0.001), total plaque (r = -0.579,
p < 0.001), total tangle (r = -0.507,
p < 0.001), and Braak score (r = -0.539,
p < 0.001).
Furthermore, correlation analysis between age, sex, APOE allele, and all 2,080 reliably detected metabolites/features was also performed; no association was observed to be both strongly correlated (r = -0.5-0.5) and statistically signi cant (p > 0.05).

Pathway and enrichment analyses of metabolic data
Subjects were grouped as case (MCI and AD) and control (NC and HPC) for analysis of signi cantly impacted pathways in response to Alzheimer's progression.
Pathway analysis was conducted using KEGG database searches and metabolite intensities (Fig.
Three pathways were observed to have large impact coe cients (> 0.5): (1) linoleic acid metabolism, (2) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and (3) arginine and proline metabolism.
Importantly, three pathways were found to be signi cantly affected (p < 0.05) as a result of increased AD pathogenesis.
Namely, those were lysine degradation, fatty acid metabolism, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation.
Subjects were dichotomously grouped as case/control, and enrichment analysis was conducted using a library containing 912 metabolic sets that are predicted to be changed in the case of dysfunctional enzymes using a genome-scale network model of human metabolism (Fig.
Eleven enzymes were found to be signi cantly enriched (p < 0.05).
Notably, seven of those were mitochondrial enzymes indicated against the background of mitochondrial pathways.
Full results of the enzyme enrichment analysis are displayed in Supporting Information Table

Discussion
For the last two decades, signi cant innovations in MS-based metabolic pro ling and analysis of disease-related alterations have been made and, in doing so, these efforts have borne highly sensitive and valuable diagnostic information
In the current study, we explored a combination of targeted and untargeted metabolic pro ling in addition to advanced multivariate statistical analysis for the discovery of sensitive and speci c metabolite biomarkers for rapid AD classi cation post-mortem.
To capture the diversity of metabolites involved in AD pathobiology, we have used this particular method to detect 2,080 metabolites of the superior frontal gyrus from many biologically relevant metabolic pathways.
Our multi-step biomarker selection, model construction, and cross validation have demonstrated the robust diagnostic power of this metabolic pro ling method in this study of 48 NC, HPC, MCI and AD subjects.
Additionally, we have applied complementary LC/GC-MS approaches for enhanced monitoring of the metabolome related to AD and, cumulatively, our results show clinically relevant disturbances in energy metabolism and substrate utilization.
The metabolite pro ling approach presented in this study determined 5 fatty acids capable of discriminating AD patients from NC and HPC samples with an average AUC of 97%.
Recent metabolomics studies have also shown perturbations in fatty acid metabolism across differing Alzheimer pathologies.
It was found that the dysregulation of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids, long-chain fatty acids, and unsaturated fatty acids have been associated with AD
Similarly, signi cant disturbances in fatty acid metabolism were also observed in the current study (p = 0.008).
Medium-chain fatty acids like lauric acid, which is found in high levels in coconut oil, have been proposed as possible nutritional therapies for the treatment of cognitive decline
The markedly reduced levels of these fatty acids observed in our AD subjects could be linked to the impaired glucose metabolism that is welldocumented in AD patients
Declines in the levels of the identi ed fatty acids in conjunction with decreased glucose metabolism might suggest that β-oxidation of fatty acids, which is generally low in the brain, is being upregulated to support the energy needs of the brain in AD patients.
Supplementation of the fatty acids that can be rapidly metabolized might help support the energy needs of the brain, potentially ameliorating symptoms.
This might account for the data cited in the above referenced reports which suggest that the addition of lauric acid to the diet (via coconut oil), may improve some symptoms in AD patients.
Lauric acid is known to cross the blood-brain barrier
The results of the current study warrant further investigation of the therapeutic potential of lauric acid for the treatment and prevention of AD.
Previous studies have shown evidence for brain glucose dysregulation in AD as characterized by higher brain tissue glucose concentration, reduced glycolytic ux, and lower GLUT3 expression as a function of increasing AD pathogenesis
Interestingly, the literature has shown involvement of the Warburg effect in non-tumor disease processes
In addition, previous results have shown impaired hypothalamic insulin signaling to be associated with elevated BCAA levels in a mouse model of AD
A prospective cohort study of over 22,000 participants found signi cant associations between circulating BCAAs and risk of incident dementia and AD
It has been shown that defects in BCAA metabolism, and subsequent accumulation, can lead to the phosphorylation of tau proteins and the incidence of AD
Other studies have found post-translational modi cations to the stabilizing tau proteins, which were induced by lysine residues.
It has been proposed that these modi cations may play an integral role in the pathobiology of tau protein
Our pathway analysis also revealed similar results with a signi cant degradation of lysine (p = 0.007) and BCAAs (p = 0.025), potentially signifying the underlying pathophysiology of AD.
Given the recent failure of numerous billion-dollar clinical trials targeting traditionally hypothesized AD mechanisms such as reduced acetylcholine, Aβ plaques/neuro brillary tangles, and tau protein
Overall, our ndings led to an integrated hypothesis describing the pathophysiology of AD in Fig.
As can be seen, with increased AD pathogenicity, signi cant metabolic reprogramming is observed.
Speci cally, a decrease in aerobic glycolysis is followed by a shift toward degradation of BCAA for energy The main limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size.
Moreover, our samples were taken cross-sectionally and therefore cannot infer longitudinal changes in metabolite information over time.
Also, samples were only taken from a single brain region; inferences to other AD-associated brain structures are unknown.
Nevertheless, conventional power was achieved for all biomarker analyses (β < 0.2), and models were internally validated (p < 0.01).
Our results warrant further investigation in a larger sample with serial cognitive assessments taken during life as well as tissue samples collected from distinct brain regions both resistant and vulnerable to AD pathology in order to monitor possible differential changes between tissue types.

Conclusions
This study is part of a growing body of literature in which MS-based metabolomics methods have been utilized for disease biomarker discovery and accurate classi cation
We performed comparisons of brain tissue metabolites from AD patients, MCI samples, as well as high pathology and normal controls using both targeted LC-MS/MS metabolic pro ling and an untargeted GC-MS approach     Metabolome view of pathway analysis conducted using levels of all reliably detected metabolites showing signi cantly altered pathways (p < 0.05) and those with high impact (> 0.50).


Targeted LC-MS/MS lipidomics Tissue samples were thawed under 4 °C.
Then, 200 µL 10x diluted PBS and 80 µL of MeOH containing 50 µM PC (17:0, 17:0) and PG (17:0, 17:0) internal standards were added to 20 mg of each thawed sample.
A ½ spoonful of stainless-steel micro beads was added to each sample, which was subsequently homogenized for 20 sec.
Afterward, 400 µL of MTBE was added to each sample (MTBE:MeOH:H 2 O = 10:2:5, v/v/v) and vortexed for 30 sec followed by sonication in ice bath for 20 min.
Lastly, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 RPM to separate phases.
The upper MTBE layer (300 µL) was extracted, transferred to new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, dried in a Vacufuge Plus Evaporator (Hamburg, Germany), and then reconstituted with 100 µL 1:1 CHCl 3 /MeOH.
Each sample (80 µL) was then transferred to a LC - MS vial



[
64].
Our results demonstrate signi cant alterations in a variety of the metabolites, mainly fatty acids, which are characteristic of different groups.
Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 4 unidenti ed metabolic features and, through multivariate model construction, achieved an overall classi cation performance of > 90% for comparison of AD and MCI patients, which has the potential to ful ll critical clinical needs[65].
Application of bioinformatic methods expanded basic knowledge of the metabolome related to AD and showed decreased glycolytic function with increased degradation of BCAAs and βoxidation of fatty acids associated with increased AD pathogenicity.
Results of our fold change analysis, signi cance testing, and pathway analysis indicate metabolites and pathways previously shown to be crucial in immune response inhibition [66] and increased AD severity[67].
Likewise, the metabolites and associated metabolic pathways and enzymes identi ed in this study may inform the development of new therapeutic treatments for AD.
In addition, this study provides a strong basis for larger multi-site projects to validate our ndings across different population groups and further advances the development of improved clinical care for AD patients.

3 mL/min, auto-sampler temperature was kept at 4 °C, and the column compartment was set to 40 °C.
The mobile phase was composed of Solvents A (10 mM NH 4 OAc, 10 mM NH 4 OH in 95% H 2 O/5% ACN) and B (10 mM NH 4 OAc, 10 mM NH 4 OH in 95% ACN/5% H 2 O).
After an initial 1 min isocratic elution of 90% B, the percentage of Solvent B decreased to 40% at t = 11 min.
The composition of Solvent B was maintained at 40% for 4 min (t = 15 min), after which the percentage of B gradually went back to 90%, to prepare for the next injection.
The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source.
Targeted data acquisition was performed in multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode.
For targeted data acquisition, we monitored 118 and 160 MRM transitions in negative and positive mode, respectively (278 transitions in total).
The whole LC-MS system was controlled by Agilent MassHunter Workstation software.
The extracted MRM peaks were integrated using Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Data Analysis software.

[20] and low (HPC) pathology levels are still lacking.In this study, diagnosis of HPC and MCI subgroups was achieved with more than 90% overall AUC.Realization of these ndings in plasma or CSF may inform clinical trial selection and study strati cation, enable mass screening, and indicate viable therapeutic targets.Strengths and limitationsA major strength of the study lies in the well-characterized BSHRI cohort[20]with measures of cognitive status and neuropathological examination at death.
Furthermore, inclusion of traditionally understudied HPC and MCI groups allowed for the metabolic characterization of asymptomatic individuals with ADconsistent pathology and non-AD individuals with cognitive decline, respectively.
Cumulatively, our panel of candidate markers shows potential for classi cation of individuals with early brain pathology and other dementias, facilitating enhanced post-mortem diagnosis.
Furthermore, if validated in readily available biospecimens with minimally invasive sample collection, this novel panel of candidate markers may enable early disease diagnosis and enhanced treatment options.
Additionally, we applied six distinct metabolomics assays encompassing complementary GC and LC techniques to ensure maximal coverage of the brain metabolome and were able to monitor more than 2,000 metabolites and features.
Given the known bene t of complementary MS platforms for elucidation of AD pathology [18, 62, 63], our largescale multi-platform metabolomics approach utilizing both targeted and untargeted pro ling enables comprehensive pathway and enzyme analysis, a key strength of this study to previous literature.
