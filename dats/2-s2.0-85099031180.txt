Plasma Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease in African Americans
Background/Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if plasma concentrations of 5 surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neuroinflammation are associated with disease status in African Americans.
Methods: We evaluated 321 African Americans (159 AD, 162 controls) from the Florida Consortium for African-American Alzheimer's Disease Studies (FCA 3 DS).
Five plasma proteins reflecting AD neuropathology or inflammation (A␤ 42 , tau, IL6, IL10, TNF␣) were tested for associations with AD, age, sex, APOE and MAPT genotypes, and for pairwise correlations.
Results: Plasma tau levels were higher in AD when adjusted for biological and technical covariates.
APOE 4 was associated with lower plasma A␤ 42 and tau levels.
Older age was associated with higher plasma A␤ 42 , tau, and TNF␣.
Females had lower IL10 levels.
Inflammatory proteins had strong pairwise correlations amongst themselves and with A␤ 42 .
We identified effects of demographic and genetic variants on five potential plasma biomarkers in African Americans.
Plasma inflammatory biomarkers and A␤ 42 may reflect correlated pathologies and elevated plasma tau may be a biomarker of AD in this population.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing epidemic that disproportionately affects African Americans
The prevalence of AD is estimated to be about twice as high in African Americans as in individuals of European ancestry.
The United States (US) census projections estimate that by 2050, 42% of elderly adults will be members of minority groups
Thus, the toll of AD is expected to rise considerably in the African-American population, underscoring the importance of discovering effective biomarkers and therapies that are relevant to this population.
Despite this rising prevalence, African Americans are underrepresented in AD research, including biomarker studies and clinical trials
A recent evaluation of major federally-funded biomarker studies in the US revealed that more than half of these studies did not achieve adequate recruitment of African Americans to reach the representation ISSN 1387-2877/21/$35.00

expected from the US census
Due to this underrepresentation, the clinical utility and characteristics of biomarkers, which are primarily established in participants of European ancestry, are unclear for African Americans.
Emerging studies evaluating neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels suggest that there may be population specific differences for these AD biomarkers between African Americans and individuals of European ancestry
However, plasma biomarker studies in African-American AD participants are scarce, even though affordable and minimally invasive biomarkers are heavily investigated in individuals of European ancestry
Furthermore, most plasma AD biomarker studies of African Americans are conducted in cognitively unimpaired or non-demented populations
Although such studies are important to evaluate the effects of these biomarkers on cognition, investigations on the characteristics and diagnostic potential of plasma biomarkers in African-American AD study participants are sorely lacking.
In this study, we sought to fill this knowledge gap by investigating plasma protein levels in 321 African-Americans AD cases and controls from the Florida Consortium for African-American Alzheimer's Disease Studies (FCA 3 DS)
We measured plasma levels of five proteins reflecting either core AD neuropathology (amyloid-␤ 42
These proteins have been extensively studied as diagnostic biomarkers of AD
Our study provides a thorough characterization of these plasma proteins in our sizable FCA 3 DS African-American AD case-control series.
Our findings have implications for the analyses of these proteins and their potential as diagnostic biomarkers of AD in this population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants
A total of 321 self-reported African-American individuals (159 AD cases and 162 controls) were recruited at the Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida for this study (Table
All cognitively normal controls and AD cases included in this study were Mayo Clinic patients who consented to participate in AD research as part of the FCA 3 DS
Informed consent and approval by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board was obtained.

Single molecule arrays by quanterix
Plasma was stored at -80 • C until the protein quantifications.
Plasma proteins were quantified using single molecule array (Simoa) assays on the Simoa HD1-Analyzer (Quanterix, Lexington, MA), with a single freeze-thaw cycle between the multiplex Simoa Human Cytokine 3-Plex A assay (IL6, IL10, and TNF␣) and the single-analyte Simoa Human assays (A␤ 42 and tau).
The Simoa tau assay that was utilized recognizes all human tau isoforms including phosphorylated tau.
All plasma samples were assayed in duplicate for each protein, according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The first lot of reagents was utilized to measure protein levels in 66 AD cases (batch 1), while the second lot was used to measure 93 AD cases and 162 controls (batch 2).
Supplementary Table
For all protein measurements, samples were randomized according to age and sex within in each batch, and in the second batch samples were also randomized according to diagnosis.
In addition, when the two batches were analyzed jointly, statistical analyses included a covariate to adjust for potential batch effects.

Genotyping
We extracted DNA from blood using the FLEX STAR system (AutoGen, MA, USA) and the Flex-iGene DNA Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions.
We utilized TaqMan genotyping assays to obtain APOE 2/3/4 genotypes (C 3084793 20 for rs429358, C 904973 10 for rs7412) and MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes (C 29297996 10 for rs8070723) using a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) with an Eppendorf Mastercycler Pro 384 with vapo.protect
(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).

Statistical analysis
Mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (CoV) were calculated for every duplicate plasma protein measurement.
Measurements with >20% CoV were excluded from the analysis.
Statistical analyses for the five plasma proteins were performed on the log2-transformed mean of duplicate measurements, as these values were normally distributed (Supplementary Figure
Separate multivariable linear regression models were used to examine independent predictors of our dependent variables, the plasma AD biomarkers.
As aforementioned, the log2-transformed mean of duplicate plasma biomarkers measurements were used.
All analyses included age of the study participant at blood draw (age), number of years of plasma storage (age of plasma), sex, plate, and batch variables.
The primary analytic model (Model 1) included these variables, as well as diagnosis, APOE 4 dosage (0, 1, or 2 copies of the 4 allele) as it is a well-known ADrisk factor, and MAPT H1 haplotype dosage (0, 1, or 2 copies of the H1 haplotype) given that MAPT H1 haplotype is associated with higher brain levels of MAPT
We also performed exploratory analyses that did not adjust for APOE 4 dosage (Model 2) or MAPT H1 haplotype dosage (Model 3) in order to assess the individual genetic effects of MAPT or APOE, respectively.
In the main analyses, batch 1 (AD only) and batch 2 (AD and controls) were analyzed jointly, while appropriately adjusting for potential batch effects (Table
Secondary analyses stratified by batch and by diagnosis were also conducted to determine whether the findings were driven by either of these strata (Supplementary Tables
We also evaluated the relationship between each pair of biomarkers using multivariable linear regression where log2 transformed plasma levels of each biomarker were tested as the dependent variable in models which assessed all other biomarkers individually as independent variables.
These analyses were adjusted for APOE 4 dosage, age, sex, diagnosis, years of plasma storage, plate, and batch.
All association analyses were performed using linear fixed-effects models in R version 3.4.4.
Data was visualized using the ggplot2 package in R. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Type 1 error rate was considered as 0.05.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated in R version 3.6.2
using residuals from the model that included all the variables except for diagnosis.

RESULTS
A total of 23 plasma samples were excluded from the corresponding protein analyses due to quantification failure; 20 for IL6, 2 for IL10, and 1 for TNF␣.
Two tau measurements exceeded the CoV threshold and were excluded from subsequent analyses.
The average CoV for all measurements was 3%, highlighting the high degree of precision in repeat measurements.
Participant demographics and summary statistics for the plasma proteins analyzed are shown in Table
These data are also shown stratified by diagnosis, sex, APOE genotypes and MAPT haplotypes, as well as measurement batch in Supplementary Table
Controls were significantly older than AD cases both in the combined analysis (Table
AD participants from batch 2 were also significantly older than AD cases in batch 1 (data not shown).
There were no differences in the distribution of sex between the diagnostic groups in batch 2 or in the combined analysis (Table
As expected
There was no difference in the MAPT haplotype frequency between AD cases and controls (Table
Following log2 transformation, all plasma protein measurements were normally distributed within each of the AD and control groups and in all samples combined (Supplementary Figure
Age was significant for three of the five tested plasma proteins in these African-American samples.
In the combined analysis, higher plasma levels of A␤ 42 , tau, and TNF␣ were significantly associated with older age (Table
Associations with age were strongest for plasma A␤ 42 under all models (Table
Association between age and tau levels was most significant for the older AD participants in batch 2, which may be suggestive of an influence of both disease and age on this biomarker (Supplementary Table
This is supported by the observation that plasma tau levels were significantly higher in AD participants compared to controls.
TNF␣ was significantly associated with age only in the control participants (Supplementary Table
Higher plasma IL6 was significantly associated with older age in the combined set of AD cases and controls in batch 2 (Supplementary Table
Higher IL10 levels were associated with older age that was significant only in AD cases in batch 1 (Supplementary Table
APOE 4 dosage was significantly associated with lower A␤ 42 and tau levels (Table
These associations were observed in both diagnostic groups and in both batches (Supplementary Table
No significant associations were observed with MAPT H1 haplotype dosage in the combined analysis (Table
Female sex was associated with lower plasma IL10 levels in the combined analysis (Table
Although the other two inflammatory biomarkers, IL6 (Supplementary Figure
IL10 associations and TNF␣ trends with sex appeared to be driven by AD with the strongest effects observed in batch 1 and batch 2, respectively (Supplementary Table
The only biomarker that showed significant association with diagnosis in the combined analysis was tau, which was higher in AD (Table
We note that AD cases had slightly lower, though insignificant, mean tau levels compared to controls (Table
However, in our study, controls were older and had lower APOE 4 frequency, and plasma samples of AD cases were stored longer (median plasma storage time = 13.44 years) than controls (7.36 years) which led to strong associations with the technical variable of years of plasma storage and lower plasma tau levels (data not shown).
After adjusting for biological and technical variables, AD diagnosis was associated with higher plasma tau levels.
This association was independent of MAPT haplotypes and persisted whether they were included (Model 1) or excluded (Model 3) from the analyses.
Analysis of sensitivity and specificity of plasma tau concentrations as discriminator of AD diagnosis showed an area under the ROC curve of 0.55 and the highest estimated value of (sensitivity + specificity)/2 was obtained at a cut-point where the sensitivity is 63% and the specificity is 50%.
IL6 levels were significantly higher in AD cases than in controls in batch 2 (Supplementary Table
To evaluate the relationship of these plasma biomarkers, pairwise analyses were performed adjusting for biological and technical covariates.
All observed protein-protein associations had positive regression coefficients (Table
Strong associations were observed between plasma A␤ 42 and tau levels, whether A␤ 42 or tau were analyzed as the dependent variable.
Significant positive associations were also observed amongst the inflammatory biomarkers IL6, IL10, and TNF␣.
Among the inflammatory biomarkers, TNF␣ was positively associated with A␤ 42 , and to a lesser but still statistically significant level with tau.
Plasma IL6 levels were also positively associated with A␤ 42 , but displaying only a marginal trend with tau.
The pairwise associations of these plasma biomarkers were in general consistently observed when AD cases and controls were analyzed separately (Supplementary Table
Scatter plots showing pairwise protein correlations are shown in Supplementary Figure

DISCUSSION
Our study sought to evaluate the diagnostic potential of five potential plasma biomarkers, namely A␤ 42 , total tau, IL6, IL10, and TNF␣.
These plasma protein measurements were obtained via single molecule array technology implemented in the Simoa HD1 platform, known for its sensitivity and reproducibility even at low concentrations
The association of biological variables including age, sex, APOE 4 dosage, MAPT H1dosage, and AD diagnosis was also evaluated in our study.
We found significantly higher levels of plasma total tau in African-American AD cases compared to elderly, cognitively unimpaired controls, after adjusting for biological and technical variables.
AD cases had slightly lower, though insignificant, mean tau levels compared to controls, when no covariate adjustments are made.
However, in our study, Table
All analyses were adjusted for technical variables, APOE 4 dosage, age, and sex.
Variables in the rows represent the dependent variables and those in the columns the tested independent variables in the models.
To aid interpretability of results, the estimated coefficients were transformed to provide estimates of percent change in plasma level associated with the specified change in value of the independent variable.
The transformation was: (100*(2 ∧ beta-1)) where beta was the raw estimated coefficient.
95% CI refer to 95% confidence intervals of the change.
controls were older and had lower APOE 4 frequency, which may lead to increases in their plasma tau levels.
Further, we observed strong associations with the technical variable of years of plasma storage and lower plasma tau levels.
If unadjusted for, this would also confound the results toward lower tau levels in AD, as plasma samples of AD cases were stored longer.
These results highlight the importance of adequate evaluation and adjustment for variables in biomarker studies.
Previous studies conducted in European
More recently, a comprehensive meta-analysis of biomarker studies evaluated plasma or serum data from 271 AD participants and 394 controls
This meta-analysis identified significantly higher total tau levels in AD participants, consistent with our findings.
Interestingly, of the peripheral biomarkers meta-analyzed in that study (YKL-40, HFABP, A␤ 40 , A␤ 42 , MCP-1, NSE, and tau), total tau was the only one significantly associated with AD.
In our study, we did not identify significant associations with AD for any of the other biomarkers assessed, namely A␤ 42 and the inflammatory proteins, IL6, IL10, and TNF␣.
Previous cross-sectional studies on plasma A␤ levels as a diagnostic AD biomarker revealed conflicting results
Prospective studies which evaluated baseline A␤ levels as a predictive biomarker for cognitive decline and/or incident AD also had some discrepancies.
In some prospective studies, higher levels of plasma A␤ 42 at baseline were associated with greater risk of incident AD
Others determined that lower baseline A␤ 42 /A␤ 40
To our knowledge, there are no studies in African Americans that evaluated cytokines as potential AD diagnostic biomarkers.
Neuroinflammation is considered an integral part of AD pathophysiology
A recent meta-analysis of peripheral cytokines and chemokines
In this larger meta-analysis, only higher plasma IL6 levels had significant association with AD.
Neither TNF␣ nor IL10 plasma levels had significant associations with AD, although CSF levels of IL10 were higher in AD than controls in a meta-analysis of three studies
We took advantage of the multiplex assay from Simoa to investigate in our FCA 3 DS case-control series three cytokines, IL6, IL10, and TNF␣, which have previously been studied in many European
None of these biomarkers were significantly associated with AD in the overall FCA 3 DS case-control series.
Among the biological variables tested as potential modifiers of plasma biomarker levels (age, sex, APOE 4 dosage, and MAPT H1 haplotype dosage), age, APOE 4 dosage, and sex showed significant effects.
Older age had significant associations with elevated plasma levels of A␤ 42 , tau, and TNF␣.
Plasma A␤ 42 and/or A␤ 40 levels were previously shown to be elevated with age in both cross-sectional
In our cross-sectional study, age had significant influence on plasma A␤ 42 levels in both AD cases and controls, even when analyzed separately.
Higher plasma tau levels were also associated with older age in our study.
These findings are consistent both with the notion that plasma tau is likely a biomarker of neurodegeneration
We also identified association between older age and TNF␣, as previously reported
Indeed, aging is thought to be associated with chronic low grade inflammation.
Increased levels of cytokines including TNF␣ and IL6 are correlated with frailty, cognitive decline, other morbidities, and increased mortality in the elderly
In our study, the strongest influence of age on TNF␣ was detected in the controls, which had the oldest mean age of 82.7.
We also observed a significant association of APOE 4 dosage with lower plasma A␤ 42 levels in the overall case-control series, as well as in AD cases and controls separately.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies, including one on LOAD families of European ancestry in which our group identified association of the APOE 4/4 genotype with lower plasma A␤ 42 levels
Even though the estimated risk of AD conferred by APOE 4 is lower in African Americans than that in individuals of European ancestry
An inverse relationship was also observed between APOE 4 and plasma tau levels in our study.
In a previous study of two cohorts of European ancestry, plasma tau was increased in APOE 4 carriers in one cohort but not in the other
Future studies that include additional African Americans and individuals of European ancestry, as well as other race/ethnicities are needed to determine whether these conflicting findings represent actual population differences in the effect of APOE on plasma tau levels.
Furthermore, an association of female sex with lower plasma IL10 levels was observed in our study.
IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, lower levels of which are thought to result in an enhanced inflammatory status
IL10 was previously shown to be lower in African-American women who were disproportionately affected by metabolic conditions
The implications of these findings, specifically for AD risk, and whether this is an indication of sex-specific differences in the general inflammatory status in this population remain to be established.
Underrepresentation of African Americans in biomarker studies poses a major barrier to the discovery of population-specific risk factors and translation of such findings to therapeutic targets, biomarkers and management approaches relevant to this population
Given the existing healthcare disparities for African Americans reflected in their delayed presentation for evaluation and lower likelihood to receive dementia treatment
AD diagnostic and predictive potential of plasma biomarkers are unknown for African Americans, despite the fact that some plasma biomarkers have already been assessed in as many as >1,000
It is probable that utilizing multiple biomarkers jointly, rather than individually, will provide more robust outcomes and may also provide insight about disease pathophysiology
In this context, it is also useful to characterize correlations or associations between different biomarkers.
We identified positive associations between A␤ 42 and tau with the inflammatory cytokines; as well as between TNF␣ and both A␤ 42 and tau.
These associations were similar in AD cases and controls, suggesting they are not driven by clinical AD.
Correlative biomarker studies are scarce.
One study identified no correlations between plasma A␤ levels and IL6, IL10, or TNF␣
We postulate that the correlated plasma A␤ 42 , tau, and TNF␣ levels may be reflective of both age-and AD-related increases in brain A␤ 42 and tau, with concurrent enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Future neuroimaging and CSF biomarker studies in this population would enable validation of this hypothesis.
In summary, our study provides detailed assessment of five plasma biomarkers in an African-American case-control series consisting of 159 AD participants and 162 controls.
Our plasma biomarker study has a sizable representation of African-American AD cases, in comparison to prior studies of this population, which either lacked or had limited numbers of AD participants of less than 50
Our evaluation of both primary AD neuropathology biomarkers (A␤ and tau), and those of inflammation (IL6, IL10, TNF␣) aims to yield information on different facets of AD pathophysiology.
Another strength of our study is its experimental rigor, which includes single molecule array technology for biomarker measurements, multiplex assay of three cytokines, performing of all measurements in a limited time period and adjusting for multiple technical variables.
Our findings support AD related changes in plasma tau levels in African Americans.
Even though plasma tau cannot be used alone as a diagnostic biomarker for AD given overlap of its levels with controls, as shown by our sensitivity and specificity analysis, it can potentially be considered as part of a panel for patient stratification or disease staging in African-American populations, as proposed for European study participants
Our study also demonstrates influence of APOE 4, age at measurement, and sex on a variety of plasma proteins, which should serve as a practical guide for experimental design and analytic plan for future studies of these biomarkers in African Americans and other populations.
Correlative plasma biomarker results generate hypotheses on concerted biological processes, which must be tested in future studies that assess complementary neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers in this and other populations.
Despite these strengths, our study also has several weaknesses.
Given that it is a cross-sectional study, the findings are prone to inter-individual variability of biomarkers that may not be related with AD, or to the other variables we adjusted for in this study.
For this reason, longitudinal measurements of biomarkers and assessment of their prospective intra-individual variability is advocated as a more reliable biomarker
Another limitation of this study is that information regarding family history was not available for 80/159 (50%) of the controls.
Among the 79 controls for whom family history was recorded, 40 had family history of dementia and 39 did not.
This proportion of positive family history is higher than that estimated in a study by
This potential ascertainment bias in our study may have led to an underestimate of the effect size of the association of plasma tau protein in African American AD versus cognitively unimpaired controls.
Although the association of plasma tau with diagnosis would not reach significance after correction for the five plasma proteins tested, the nominal associations we identified in the context of this understudied population are consistent with previously published work in European, European American, and Taiwanese cohorts and thus highly plausible.
Despite having a sizable representation of AD participants and elderly controls, the sample size of our African-American case-control series is still a fraction of that collectively assessed in plasma biomarker meta-analyses of European ancestry cohorts
Although our study provides a thorough characterization of five plasma biomarkers in this understudied population, the field needs studies with even larger African-American series for replication of our results.
Evaluation of other plasma protein biomarkers, such as ptau and A␤ 40 , is also needed; however, at the time when this study was conducted, the ptau assay had not been validated yet in plasma, and the amount of plasma available was insufficient for additional measurements.
The findings from our study including effect sizes, which were previously lacking in the literature for this population, should help guide design of such future studies.
Finally, future plasma biomarker studies of African Americans and other understudied minority populations should include markers of disease severity such as detailed neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures.
Studies which can control for other factors that can influence plasma protein levels such as information on presence of infection or inflammation at the time of blood collection
This cross-sectional biomarker study on 321 FCA 3 DS AD cases and elderly, cognitively unimpaired controls provides a previously lacking detailed evaluation of five plasma proteins representing core AD pathology and inflammation in this understudied population.
The findings of this study support further investigations of plasma tau as a potential AD biomarker and should help guide future studies of these biomarkers in African Americans.
