The central role of tau in Alzheimer’s disease: From neurofibrillary tangle maturation to the induction of cell death
The tau protein (τ) is one of the two hallmark proteins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) together with the amyloid β protein (Aβ).
In contrast to Aβ, abnormal phosphorylated τ (p-τ) can also be found in non-AD tauopathies.
In AD, p-τ is the main component of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which result from aggregation of abnormal phosphorylated and folded τ.
In this review, we discuss the role of p-τ pathology in Alzheimer's disease considering neuropathological, biochemical, cellular, animal model, and clinical findings.
We discuss the relationship between p-τ and other AD-related proteins such as Aβ and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43).
In light of the current state of knowledge, we conclude that p-τ aggregation known as primary age-related tauopathy (PART) may represent a prerequisite for the development of AD rather that a downstream effect of Aβ toxicity.
However, Aβ as well as TDP-43 pathology appear to accelerate accumulation and propagation of p-τ pathology once initiated, ultimately leading to the full-blown picture in AD. τ seeds can induce granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), AD-typical lesions in which the activated necrosomerequired for the execution of necroptosis, a programmed form of cell death -can be found.
GVD is associated with a decreasing neuronal density.
Thus, we speculate that p-τ pathology is a major driver for neuron loss in AD via GVD-mediated necroptosis.
Accordingly, p-τ seems to play a central role in AD as it appears to constitute a prerequisite for AD development which can then be accelerated by co-factors.
This would fit in a probabilistic model of AD, related to the presence and severity of the respective co-factors such as Aβ, TDP-43, and others.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementing disorder in the elderly
It is characterized by its hallmark lesions, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
Amyloid plaques consist of extracellular aggregates of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ)
The cleavage of APP by the β-and γ-secretase releases Aβ
The active center of γ-secretase is represented by either presenilin 1 or 2
NFTs are intraneuronal aggregates of abnormal phosphorylated tau (τ)-protein
Given that mutations in the APP gene, the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and 2 (PSEN2) genes lead to familial forms of AD
Unfortunately, clinical trials using antibodies against Aβ, active vaccination strategies, or secretase inhibitors did not lead to a major modification of the course of the disease although amyloid plaques were reduced
This raised the question whether the amyloid hypothesis needs to be replaced by a pathogenetic concept that can explain the failure of the anti-amyloid trials.
Moreover, NFT pathology correlates better with clinical dementia scores than Aβ pathology
However, none of the τ-targeting therapies developed so far was successfully tested in a clinical trial: one was ineffective whereas other studies are still ongoing
Recently, a probabilistic concept was suggested in which the genetic drivers of familial AD as well as apolipoprotein E still have a significant weight but are
In this review article, we will describe the basic biochemical/biophysical and neuropathological features of τ and its roles in AD as a prerequisite for disease development as well as a critical player in the execution of neurodegeneration.

The τ protein: Aggregation, phosphorylation and maturation
τ protein is a microtubule associated protein that stabilizes the microtubules in the axon and regulates axonal transport
Alternative splicing of exon 10 of the τ gene (MAPT) leads to 6 different τ isoforms (D'
Three of them carry three repeats (3-repeat τ (3R τ)) in the repeat region of the protein, whereas the remaining three isoforms have four repeats (4-repeat τ (4R τ)).
Accumulation of τ protein forms protofibrils which are then converted to fibrils by forming straight and paired helical filaments (PHFs).
Protofibrils exhibit disease specific folding architectures at the cryo electron microscopy level that allow to distinguish an "Alzheimer fold" from τ folds seen in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Pick's disease and corticobasal degeneration
In AD, τ lesions are composed of 3R and 4R τ
However, the extracellular "ghost" tangles are enriched in 3R τ
Phosphorylation of τ protein is a physiological process and is required for the regulation of the axonal transport by maintaining microtubule integrity
The physiological phosphorylation of τ occurs in normal processes such as neural development
Abnormal phosphorylation of τ, on the other hand, leads to its mislocalization into the somatodendritic compartment of neurons
Different τ phosphorylation sites are involved in the abnormal phosphorylation of τ (Fig.
First, phospho-threonine 231 (pT231, detected with the AT180 antibody) occurs in somatodendritic compartment as "initial cytoplasmic τ".
Nearly simultaneously, phospho-serines 396 and 404 (pS396/pS404, detected with the PHF1 antibody) are found in axonal/synaptic compartments of neurons, referred to as "initial neuropil τ" (Aragao
This is followed by the formation of pretangles exhibiting also pS202/pT205-τ (detected with the AT8 antibody).
Subsequently, an abnormal conformation of the τ protein, called the "paperclip conformation" or "MC1" conformation, is detected prior to formation of argyrophilic and ubiquitin/p62 immunoreactive NFTs (Figs. 1, 2) (Aragao
The p-τ forms that are measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as AD biomarkers, pT181-τ and pT217-τ, have been reported to occur in p-τ lesions also exhibiting pS202/pT205-τ, pT231-τ, and pS396/pS404-τ (Aragao
Although it is well known that abnormal phosphorylation often leads to τ aggregation and results in neurotoxicity, τ phosphorylation can also have beneficial effects.
Specifically, the phosphorylation at T18 promotes normal axonal trafficking
Another study has also observed that the phosphorylation at sites S214, and S262 prevents τ fibrillization into PHFs, suggesting that τ phosphorylation in AD may not necessarily result in τ aggregation
Corroborating these data, Strang and colleagues reported that S305 phosphorylation also inhibited aggregation in vitro
Additionally, a protective effect of site-specific τ phosphorylation by kinase p38γ was observed in vivo, precluding Aβ toxicity
Finally, there are reports of τ phosphorylation constituting a protective mechanism against oxidative stress in AD
A recent review suggested that in advanced disease stages, aberrant phosphorylation of τ may overwhelm protective phosphorylation mechanisms and promotes neuronal demise
These studies highlight that τ phosphorylation in the brain is a highly complex process involving multiple possible phosphorylation sites.
AD-related p-τ formation in this context involves tauopathy related phosphorylation sites presumably destabilizing the physiological balance of aggregation-prone and aggregation-inhibiting τ phosphorylation sites.
In addition to phosphorylation, proteomic studies revealed a wide range of additional posttransitional modifications of τ, including ubiquitylation, acetylation and truncation in AD
Colocalization with the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in a large subset of AD cases
TDP-43 accumulation in this context can be seen as early as in the pretangle stage (Fig.

τ pathology: Lesions, distribution and propagation

Neuropathological aspects
Neuropathologically, we distinguish NFTs, pretangles and neuropil threads in the AD brain (Fig.
Inclusions in non-neuronal cells, i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, are restricted to non-AD tauopathies
In addition to NFTs, pretangles, and neuropil threads, initial τ aggregates in the cytoplasm of neurons and in the neurites exhibiting only single phosphoepitopes of τ have been described as precursor lesions for pretangles.
Initial cytoplasmic τ aggregates exhibit pT231-τ (Fig.
The first region in the human brain that exhibits p-τ pathology is the locus coeruleus.
Here, only neuropil threads occur first (Braak NFT stage "a"), being later accompanied by pretangles
Next, pretangle pathology extends into other subcortical nuclei, namely the raphe nuclei and the basal nucleus of Meynert (Braak NFT-stage "c")
The cortical involvement in p-τ pathology starts with the transentorhinal cortex (Braak NFT stages "1a, 1b", I), followed by the entorhinal cortex
Finally, the primary cortical fields become involved as well (Braak NFT stage VI)
This pattern was described by first Heiko and Eva Braak
NFT pathology is by definition currently considered as AD neuropathological change (ADNC) when Aβ plaques are present as well
In the event that NFTs are seen in the absence of Aβ plaque pathology they are considered to represent a primary age-related tauopathy (PART)
However, emerging evidence points out that PART may represent in most cases an early, pre-amyloid stage of the pathogenesis of AD.
This evidence is related to the clear sequence of events of p-τ pathology evolution (a) based on the topographical expansion pattern according to the Braak NFT stages
Another argument for PART being part of the AD pathological continuum is the seeding potential similarity of p-τ aggregates from PART and ADNC patientderived brain homogenates
Moreover, most PART patients (≥52%) exhibited clinical signs of AD
However, at the moment that PART is diagnosed as PART, one cannot exclude that it does not develop in a different tauopathy than AD, such as NFT-predominant dementia (equals PART with clinical symptoms), argyrophilic grain disease and other form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with τ pathology (FTLD-tau)
The presence of genetic risk factors for tauopathies other than AD in PART cases
In approx.
40 % of the PART cases clinical symptoms do not fit well with that of AD
Interestingly, symptomatic cases with PART usually exhibited co-pathologies (best cerebrovascular pathology) that better correlated with cognitive function than the Braak NFT-stage
Other researchers showed that PART cases only show language deficits correlating with anterior temporal atrophy whereas atrophy and the spectrum of cognitive deficits was more widespread in AD than in PART
This difference may be explained by the limited distribution of p-τ pathology in PART cases, most frequently representing Braak NFT stages I and II whereas AD spectrum cases had usually high Braak stages (IV-VI) in this study
Accordingly, this study does in our opinion not argue against the hypothesis that AD develops from PART as initiating pathology.
In this context, less frequently other tauopathies may also arise from the "precursor" lesion PART as proposed earlier
This indicates in our opinion that PART is a "precursor" lesion for a number of tauopathies with AD being the by far biggest player among them.
Interestingly, when accepting the locus coeruleus, the raphe nuclei and the basal nucleus of Meynert as initiating foci kicking off the evolution of AD pathology, one can explain the spread towards later affected brain regions by anterograde transmission of pathology (Fig.
This hypothesis is supported by the finding that p-τ accumulation in pre-α neurons of the entorhinal cortex is first restricted to dendrites and the cytoplasm before
Thal & Tomé 10 p-τ can be visualized in the axonal region of these neurons in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in a later stage
Thus, p-τ may be transported within the neuron from the somatodendritic compartment to the axon terminals via regular anterograde axonal transport as a prerequisite for anterograde neuron-to-neuron spreading.
This has been confirmed in-vitro in a three-chamber neuron culture system.
Here, it was also shown that synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms were involved in the neuron-to-neuron transmission of p-τ pathology
Alternatively, nanotubes between neurons have also been discussed to contribute to the transmission of p-τ pathology
In-vivo spreading of p-τ has been demonstrated after injecting seeds into mouse brains
Braak NFT stage "a" changes may occur as early as with six years of age, at least in a small amount of autopsied cases with this age
With increasing age, the frequency of p-τ pathology in the brain also increases.
At 40 years, all investigated cases in a cohort with 2332 cases exhibited at least Braak NFT stage "a"
High Braak NFT stages (V and VI) become apparent in single cases with 40 years of age and increase with age.
In the age group 90-100 years approx.
25% of the cases exhibited Braak NFT stages V and VI
This increase in p-τ pathology is accompanied by the deposition of Aβ plaques and its spreading in the whole brain
Interestingly, Aβ pathology usually occurs slightly later than p-τ lesions, around 17 years of age at the earliest
Fig.
The Braak NFT stages "a-1b" were not determined in this cohort.

Biomarker-related aspects
Thal & Tomé 11
During life, histopathological analysis of different brain regions is not possible without serious side effects for patients and is, therefore, not a diagnostic option.
Accordingly, it is essential to estimate p-τ pathology with the help of biomarkers.
Currently, the measurement of total τ and p-τ levels is possible in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
In this context the fluid biomarkers for pT181-τ, pT217-τ, and pT231-τ are remarkably specific for AD and correlate also with Aβ levels
In contrast to the neuropathological detection of p-τ accumulation neurons, which precedes Aβ pathology in most cases (Fig.
That the detection of p-τ and Aβ biomarkers is different from the neuropathological sequence of events is related to a lower sensitivity of the biomarkers compared to the identification of single NFTs or Aβ plaques by microscopic examination in the brain.
In this context p-τ biomarkers appear to be less sensitive than Aβrelated biomarkers.
For example, the sensitivity of the flortaucipir τ PET had been investigated in an end-of-life study
Here, detection of τ pathology was restricted to Braak NFT-stages V and VI, i.e., the end stages of AD.
Braak stage I and II cases were detected in less than 75% of the investigated cases
Likewise, blood p-τ showed an increase with Braak NFT stages using assays detecting p-τ 181 with Braak stages I-III showing levels not significantly different from p-τ negative cases
Thus, it is difficult to detect preclinical AD cases with τ biomarkers.
Amyloid PET, on the other hand, can identify Aβ phase 3-5 cases covering usually non-demented individuals with Aβ phase 3 (La
Moreover, one study did not find a correlation between CSF p-τ and the post-mortem Braak NFT stage
pT231-τ was in this context the most sensitive marker

Interplay between τ, Aβ, TDP-43, α-synuclein, and noradrenalin metabolites

Interplay with Aβ
In AD cases, p-τ pathology is accompanied with Aβ plaque pathology.
Both pathologies increase in parallel in amount and distribution among the brain regions
However, a significant number of Braak NFT-stage I and II cases exhibit no Aβ plaque pathology, indicating that p-τ precedes Aβ plaque pathology
Cases showing Aβ plaques in the absence of p-τ pathology are, on the other hand, very rare
Since the current recommendations of the National Institute of Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) for the assessment of AD neuropathological changes define Alzheimer pathology by the presence of Aβ plaques, those cases with p-τ pathology in the absence of Aβ do not fall under this definition of AD and have been referred to as cases having a primary age-related tauopathy (PART)
Interestingly, the increase of p-τ towards Braak NFT stages V and VI is always accompanied with an increase in Aβ plaque pathology
This parallel increase of p-τ and Aβ pathology was also seen in cases with severe p-τ pathology in a recent longitudinal amyloid and τ imaging study
Thus, if PART proceeds in the absence of Aβ it will lead to a non-AD tauopathy, e.g., NFT-predominant dementia.
P-τ and Aβ pathology do not only accumulate in parallel during the preclinical and symptomatic stages of AD, but also interact with one another as indirectly shown in animal models and imaging studies
This interaction of Aβ and τ is best documented in mouse models.
In single (τ P301L) and double-transgenic mouse models (τ JNPL3/APPTg2576; APP23xTAU58), Aβ accelerated p-τ pathology
On a cellular and biochemical level, there is evidence that the cellular prion protein (PrP C ) plays an important role in the interaction between Aβ and p-τ because both proteins bind to PrP C in APP23xTAU58 mouse and in human AD brain
Moreover, functional analysis of the role of PrP C in this context revealed that PrP C is essential for this pathological interaction.
In the absence of PrP C , Aβ had no major pathological impact on τ and neuronal function in iPSC-derived neuronal cell cultures
An explanation for the role of PrP C in the interplay between Aβ and p-τ could be the fact that PrP C has been described to act as a receptor for soluble, oligomeric Aβ species responsible for synaptic impairment
This hypothesis is supported by the fact that APP-transgenic mice show no synaptic impairment when bred on a Prnp-knockout background
Other authors did not find such a protection when crossing APP-transgenic and Prnp-knockout mice
Moreover, a possible mechanism for PrP C to accelerate p-τ pathology is being an interaction partner of soluble Aβ oligomers activating Fyn
These interactions between Aβ and p-τ are mainly related to soluble Aβ species and can be observed even in the absence of amyloid plaque pathology in APP23xTAU58 mice
This means that soluble Aβ aggregates can accelerate p-τ pathology in the absence of Aβ plaques.
Accordingly, one cannot exclude that even early p-τ lesions occurring in the absence of Aβ plaques in the human brain can likewise be interacting with soluble Aβ aggregates.
On the other hand, the presence of Aβ plaques in the absence of significant p-τ pathology in neocortical brain regions of non-demented individuals with AD neuropathological changes
τpathology, e.g., PART, as a precursor lesion appears to be essential for Aβ to accelerate it
This hypothesis is supported by the finding that APP-transgenic mice on a τ knockout background did not develop cognitive deficits that were usually seen in APP-transgenic mice

Interplay with TDP-43
The accumulation of TDP-43 pathology in AD cases and in elderly individuals with AD-like dementia lacking sufficient amounts of AD pathology is frequent and currently designated as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC)
Up to 70% of AD cases present co-morbid LATE-NC.
These AD patients have smaller hippocampal volumes and a more severe clinical phenotype, when compared to demented individuals showing LATE-NC or ADNC alone
Of note, phosphorylated TDP-43 protein (pTDP-43) has been shown to co-aggregate with NFTs in AD
NFT-like aggregates containing TDP-43 have been considered to represent a distinct morphological subtype of TDP-43 proteinopathy in non-FTLD brains, typeβ, which is predominant in the limbic system
Interestingly, these NFTlike material exhibiting pTDP-43 mainly contained C-terminal species, including nonphosphorylated TDP-43 and pTDP-43 (serines 409/410, but not 403/404)
We recently observed that τ and TDP-43 proteins interact in symptomatic AD, and that this interaction occurs between p-τ and C-terminal TDP-43 species (Fig.
An impact of TDP-43 on τ expression levels was also seen in in vitro and in APP/PS1-transgenic mice expressing human TDP-43
In Caenorhabditis elegans, it was shown that TDP-43 can increase the toxicity and accumulation of τ
This is supported by findings in human cases with ADNC.
Here, the absence of TDP-43 has been associated with resilience and resistance to p-τ pathology
Consistently, post-mortem AD cases with TDP-43 pathology exhibited higher Braak NFT stages, reflecting a more widespread τ distribution than those without
We also observed this phenomenon in a recent study
Taken together, these studies support synergy between TDP-43 and τ.
Thus, it is tempting to speculate that TDP-43 is an important player in AD worsening its clinical course.
This does not mean that TDP-43 drives p-τ pathology.
Both pathologies appear to develop in parallel and TDP-43 acts as accelerator for p-τ.
Accordingly, despite the interplay between τ and TDP-43 in intraneuronal aggregates, today most researchers consider TDP-43 pathology and p-τ pathology in AD cases as lesions of separate origin, TDP-43 linked to LATE and p-τ to AD/PART
Thal & Tomé 16

Interplay with α-synuclein
The accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is another common co-pathology present in many AD patients
Its neuropathological stage is associated with younger ages at death and a faster and more aggressive progression of pathology than in AD cases lacking α-syn co-pathology
Studies have suggested that the involvement of α-syn is relevant in early stages of the disease
Consistently, an accumulating body of work postulates that α-syn contributes to AD pathophysiology
Similarly, patients with dementia with Lewy Body (DLB) also frequently exhibit p-τ pathology together with α-syn aggregates, usually co-localizing in NFTs, neurites or Lewy bodies
Plasma p-τ can detect ADNC in patients with Lewy body disease
Importantly, Parkinson's Disease patients are usually at risk for dementia and the neuropathological burden is associated with cognitive decline
An interaction between p-τ and α-syn, specifically with the C-terminal domain of α-syn, has also been described
Specifically, α-syn was shown to increase τ phosphorylation and increase its aggregation in vitro
Moreover, α-synuclein was observed to modulate p-τ pathology in transgenic mice
Overall, these studies also suggest a crosstalk between τ and α-synuclein proteins in the context of AD and DLB, although the biological and clinical implications of this interaction are not yet fully elucidated

Interplay with noradrenaline metabolites
Recently it was shown that τ can be modified by the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) metabolite of norepinephrine 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL) towards an increased aggregation and propagation throughout the brain
This modification is due to the reaction of DOPEGAL with the Lys353 residue of τ.
They observed a similar effect after replacing Lys353 residue of τ by Arg353
These findings may have importance because the locus coeruleus, one of the earliest sites of p-τ accumulation in the brain
Accordingly, it is tempting to speculate that norepinephrine oxidation by MAO-A into DOPEGAL leads to an interaction with τ that causes production and aggregation of p-τ in locus coeruleus neurons.
Furthermore, chronic stress can lead to an increased production of norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that stress has impact on the amount of τ phosphorylation and aggregation.
Moreover, the neurons of the locus coeruleus project in multiple different brain regions and are involved in stress and sleep-wake regulation
These widespread afferents (Fig.

τ pathology, granulovacuolar degeneration, necroptosis and neuron loss
The presence of ghost tangles is known for decades and demonstrates that neurons with NFTs, i.e., with p-τ pathology are subject to neuronal death (Fig.
Although apoptosis has been scarcely observed in AD, it may not be a major contributor for AD-related neuron death
Multiple other programmed forms of cell death exist
Recently, necroptosisa programmed form of necrosis -has been reported in AD
Necroptosis is characterized by the formation of the necrosome complex consisting of phosphorylated receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (pRIPK1), pRIPK3, and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL).
pMKLK oligomers act, in this context, as final executor of necroptosis
Recently, we described that in AD brain, the necrosome is formed in lesions that are morphologically defined as granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD)
GVD consists of accumulated vacuoles with granules which exhibit autophagy markers
In these vacuoles and granules, all activated necrosome components are also found
Interestingly, GVD occurs in τ transgenic but not in APP transgenic mice
A recent study indeed showed that p-τ induces necroptosis and inflammation in
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that τ pathology induces GVD and, by doing so, the activation of the necroptosis pathway.
Since necrosome expression in GVD was associated with a reduction of the neuronal density in AD
Recently, we observed that the expression of the necroptosis executor pMLKL was augmented in AD cases with co-morbid LATE-NC
Given that p-τ and TDP-43 also interact in AD, it is tempting to speculate that both τ and TDP-43 contribute to the induction of GVD-mediated necrosis.
Initial evidence for a TDP-43 contribution on GVD-mediated necroptosis was seen in the hippocampal formation of ALS patients.
Here, necrosome activation in GVD was associated not only with p-τ but also with TDP-43 pathology
On the other hand, brain regions showing only pTDP-43 pathology in ALS, such as the motor cortex or the spinal cord, did not show GVD or any kind of necrosome accumulation pointing to the presence of pτ as a potential prerequisite for the accumulation of the necrosome.
Overall, the road from p-τ accumulation to GVD-mediated necroptosis may deserve more attention in the future as it offers potential for therapeutic intervention probably by employing already available inhibitors such as Nec-1 that showed a rescue of neurons in τ-transgenic mice
Interestingly, the GVD distribution across the brain indicates that those brain regions related to chronic stress regulation and the modulation of the sleep-wakefulness state appear to be most vulnerable for GVD
All these regions receive afferent fibers from locus coeruleus
Accordingly, these regions are presumably exposed to p-τ aggregates that can trigger GVD and necroptosis since the initiation of p-τ pathology in the brain.

A central role for τ in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (Fig.
In light of the described neuropathological age-related prevalence of p-τ pathology, its maturation in a given region, its propagation into further brain regions, and its interaction with Aβ and other proteins/metabolites, one can conclude that p-τ pathology is a prerequisite for the development of Alzheimer's disease, even though Aβ may be necessary for the conversion from the preclinical and mild cognitive impairment stage to full-blown dementia
Arguments in favor of this hypothesis are (1) all symptomatic AD cases have p-τ pathology, usually of Braak NFT stage IV and higher
Braak NFT stage V/VI τ pathology is usually not seen in cases with PART and NFTpredominant type of dementia
Another argument favoring this hypothesis is the fact that APP overexpressing mouse models do not develop neurofibrillary pathology
Given that the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus are the first to be involved in the development of p-τ pathology
Neuron-to-neuron propagation appears to be accelerated by Aβ probably via a PrP C -linked mechanism
Another way of accelerating p-τ pathology spreading could be related to TDP-43 aggregates, which have been shown to propagate from neuron-to-neuron as well
Finally, τ fibrils are capable of initiating GVD-meditated activation of the necroptosis pathway
Accordingly, it is tempting to reject the amyloid hypothesis and to replace it with a hypothesis that gives τ a more central role employing a probabilistic model in which genetic, environmental players and co-pathologies contribute towards the development of dementia
Such a central role of τ in the pathogenesis of AD explains, in this context, the lacking or low efficiency of Aβ targeting therapeutical approaches and strongly encourages the development of τ targeting therapies including those directed against downstream execution pathways of neurodegeneration, e.g., the necroptosis pathway.

Figures
Figure
This may be initiated by interaction of the norepinephrine metabolite DOPEGAL with τ leading to an accelerated phosphorylation and propagation of p-τ pathology
After the first seeds are available, the primary tauopathy can increase in severity and starts to spread into brain regions that become affected in later stages.
In AD, this spreading and increase of τ pathology is presumably accelerated by additional factors, i.e., Aβ and, in cases with TDP-43 pathology, probably TDP-43
Maturation and neuron death: In parallel, neurons with p-τ pathology undergo maturation from initial cytoplasmic/ neuropil τ (IC-τ/IN-τ) accumulation, pretangle and NFT formation in each region (Aragao
This probably leads to GVD-mediated necroptosis and neuron death
Whether other cell death pathways also contribute to p-τ induced neuron death is not yet fully understood.
