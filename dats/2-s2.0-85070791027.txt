Novel Benzothiazole-Based Ureas as 17β-HSD10 Inhibitors, A Potential Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment
It has long been established that mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients can trigger pathological changes in cell metabolism by altering metabolic enzymes such as the mitochondrial 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17β-HSD10), also known as amyloid-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD).
We and others have shown that frentizole and riluzole derivatives can inhibit 17β-HSD10 and that this inhibition is beneficial and holds therapeutic merit for the treatment of AD.
Here we evaluate several novel series based on benzothiazolylurea scaffold evaluating key structural and activity relationships required for the inhibition of 17β-HSD10.
Results show that the most promising of these compounds have markedly increased potency on our previously published inhibitors, with the most promising exhibiting advantageous features like low cytotoxicity and target engagement in living cells.

Introduction
There is a strong, well-documented connection between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mitochondrial dysfunction
Mitochondrial changes in AD patients are an early event, preceding the onset of amyloid plaque formation, and include morphology abnormalities and changes in metabolism stemming from alterations in the complexes of the electron transport chain, the enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and changes in components of the mitochondrial membrane involved in import/export flux.
Mitochondria are key to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids.
Mitochondrial dysfunction in AD includes activity changes in many enzymes involved in these processes and contributes to the reduction in energy metabolism in AD
Mitochondrial dysfunction is also exacerbated by the presence of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) within mitochondria
One mitochondrial enzyme affected in AD is 17β-HSD10 (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10, also known as amyloid-β binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) or 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase).
17β-HSD10's primary role is to HSD10 (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10, also known as amyloid-β binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD) or 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase).
17β-HSD10's primary role is to utilise several substrates to produce energy in the β-fatty acid oxidation pathway, the energy source when glucose levels are low, playing a prominent role in AD, where glucose metabolism is significantly decreased
Importantly, we and others have shown that inhibition of this enzyme is beneficial in both in vitro and in vivo AD models in its own right and also protects against Aβ toxicity in both cellular and transgenic mouse models of AD
A current working hypothesis is that by inhibiting the enzyme activity of 17β-HSD10 (a contributor to the β-fatty acid oxidation pathway) this can help re-balance alterations in glucose metabolism observed in AD
17β-HSD10 was first identified as an Aβ binding protein in 1997
17β-HSD10 is known to interact with the two major plaque forming isoforms of Aβ, namely Aβ  and Aβ , leading to distortion of the enzyme structure and inhibition of its normal function as an energy provider for cells
In vitro experiments have shown that the interaction between 17β-HSD10 and Aβ is cytotoxic and 17β-HSD10's function is altered with a build-up of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and toxins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.
Using site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance protein interaction assays (SPR),
Using SPR assays it has been shown that this 17β-HSD10 decoy peptide can prevent the binding of 17β-HSD10 to Aβ  and Aβ .
Significantly, inhibition of the interaction between 17β-HSD10 and Aβ by the 17β-HSD10-decoy peptide was shown to translate into a cytoprotective effect in cell culture experiments.
Cortical neurons exposed to Aβ  showed a significant increase in cell death, as measured by cytochrome-c release, whilst those pre-incubated with the 17β-HSD10 decoy peptide did not.
Critically, for the first time, this work demonstrated that inhibition of the 17β-HSD10-Aβ interaction may target potential disease-relevant mechanisms.
Other than the disruption of the 17β-HSD10/Aβ interaction, there is a second approach which may hold merit in treating AD: the direct modulation of 17β-HSD10 enzyme activity.
In vitro experiments with neuronal-like SHSY-5Y cells exposed to the 17β-HSD10 inhibitor AG18051, showed a reduction in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress associated with the interaction between 17β-HSD10 and Aβ and protected the cells from Aβ-mediated cytotoxicity
This proved that inhibiting 17β-HSD10 activity may also be a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.
In our previously published work
Briefly, many benzothiazole analogues have been shown to possess various biological activities in the central nervous system, with riluzole itself highlighted as neuroprotective.
Thus, we focused on generating potent 17β-HSD10 inhibitors based on the benzothiazole scaffold, identifying several potent inhibitors (Figure
These compounds highlighted key structural features required for 17β-HSD10 inhibition with the 6-trifluromethoxy and 6-halogen substitution of the benzothiazole moiety and 3-chloro, 4hydroxy substitution of the phenyl moiety proving the most favourable, however, with limited solubility the compounds were not optimal for cellular evaluation.
The aim of this study was not only to generate benzothiazole urea scaffolds which would show improved potency, but to also generate These compounds highlighted key structural features required for 17β-HSD10 inhibition with the 6-trifluromethoxy and 6-halogen substitution of the benzothiazole moiety and 3-chloro, 4-hydroxy substitution of the phenyl moiety proving the most favourable, however, with limited solubility the compounds were not optimal for cellular evaluation.
The aim of this study was not only to generate benzothiazole urea scaffolds which would show improved potency, but to also generate compounds with improved tolerance and less cytotoxicity within our cellular assays, i.e., better pharmacokinetic parameters.
To that end, four series of compounds have been synthesised targeting the key areas of benzothiazole moiety, phenyl ring and urea linker (Figure

Primary Enzyme Assay Results
Full results for the primary nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) assay screens are shown in Figure
Our first analogue series
In this series, compounds 5 and 6 showed a huge improvement in potency with remaining 17β-HSD10 activity of 13.45% and 6.72%, respectively, at 25 µM.
A significant finding from our previous work indicated that a p-hydroxy along m-chlorine substitution pattern displayed the most pronounced inhibitory activity
Our findings in this series further support this, and establish that the bulkier, 3-bromo and 3-iodo substitutions are even more favourable at this position.
Replacement of the phenolic hydroxyl with an amine or methylhydroxy group led to loss of activity, which further confirms the importance of the 4-positioned phenolic hydroxyl as was previously suggested
The second analogue series ; Table
Unfortunately, any variation from the urea linker resulted in a dramatic decrease of inhibitory activity (Figure
This was further supported by the inclusion of compounds (34-36) previously published by
Indeed, all linker variations resulted in negligible changes to 17β-HSD10 activity with the exception of compound 24.
Although the secondary amide substitution (with amide nitrogen attached to benzothiazole moiety) in compound 24 appeared slightly more favourable than most, it was still not as potent as the original urea moiety and just outside of the threshold for further analysis at 47.19% 17β-HSD10 activity remaining at 25 µM (Figure
Mono and dimethylation of the urea linker to enforce sp 3 , rather than sp 2 character, showed a clear detrimental effect on the activity in compound 45-49.
The third series of compounds (61-67) focused on evaluating substitutions within the benzothiazole ring, predominantly to exploit position 6, a key area highlighted previously
Our previous findings indicated that a 6-trifluromethoxy moiety and a 6-halogen moiety led to an increased inhibitory ability towards 17β-HSD10.
This series appear to be the most promising displaying the largest decrease in 17β-HSD10 activity (indicated in Figure
This is particularly apparent in compounds 61 and 62 whereby, as the functional group size increases at position 6, 17β-HSD10 activity decreases with 6-t-butyl (62) inhibiting 17β-HSD10 by 78.36% and the 6-isopropyl substitution (61) inhibiting 17β-HSD10 by 77.37% at 25 µM.
Other key structure activity relationships in this series have been established through
Again, bulkier substituents produce a larger inhibitory effect with the 6-sulfonyl (66) less effective than the 6-trifluoromethylsulfonyl (67) with 32.16% and 16.16% 17β-HSD10 activity remaining at 25 µM.
The most potent compound in this series (65) introduced the pseudo-halogenic 6-thiocyanate moiety, which inhibited 17β-HSD10 activity by 85.69% at 25 µM.
In order to validate the importance of the benzothiazol-2-yl moiety, several structural analogues were prepared and evaluated in the fourth series (71-78; Table
Indeed, any deviation from the benzothiazol-2-yl moiety resulted in decreased biological activity and only the symmetrical compound (78) showed real inhibitory activity with 17β-HSD10 activity reduced to 40.69% at 25 µM (Figure
Overall, after primary screening we were left with 10 compounds which would progress down the pipeline: compounds 5, 6, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 and 78.

Orthogonal Counter Screens
During our enzymatic assay development, it was noted that the assay was susceptible to false positives through redox cycling and aggregation mechanism
The addition of the detergent Triton X-100 to the assay buffer prevents the hydrophobic interactions required for aggregation, by which a reduction in inhibition in the presence of Triton X-100 indicates the undesirable inhibitory mode of action whereby, the compound could be potentially inhibiting the enzyme through the indirect sequestration of the protein.
Results (Table
Compounds 65 and 67 also showed some reduction in activity but this is much less pronounced.
Given that these three compounds were part of a small series we decided to advance them into the next step of screening.
With the inclusion of the strong reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in the assay buffer, compounds can appear as a false positive as DTT is capable of generating H 2 O 2 causing indirect enzyme inhibition and assay interference.
The fluorescence change during the reduction of resazurin to resorufin can be measured as an indication of any redox cycling compounds.
The results indicate that none of the compounds appear to be acting via this undesirable mode of action (Table

Dose Response and Kinetic Evaluation
Our most promising compounds demonstrate reasonable IC 50 values of around 1-2 µM (Table
Significantly, these compounds all display a mixed mechanism of inhibition with respect to both substrate acetoacetyl-Coenzyme A and co-factor NADH whereby at low concentrations they appear to act in a competitive manner, but at high concentrations they are inhibiting in other sites (Table
This is favourable over other previously published work

Cellular Screening
Compound toxicity and potency was also assessed using HEK293 mts17β-HSD10 cells; results are shown in Table
Our fluorogenic probe, (-)-CHANA, a 17β-HSD10 substrate
Compounds 61, 62 and 63 proved to be the most potent in our cellular assay with IC 50 values of 7.88, 3.77 and 2.29 µM, respectively.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a colorimetric assay routinely used to quantitatively measure LDH released into the media from damaged cells as a biomarker for cellular cytotoxicity and cytolysis.
HEK293 mts17β-HSD10 cells were treated with compound (100 and 25 µM) for 24 h before measurements were taken.
At 25 µM compounds showed around 10-30% cytotoxicity, however, this concentration is substantially higher than the measured IC 50 values and as such is not a cause for concern.
Compound 65 showed a remarkably higher IC 50 value in the (-)-CHANA assay which suggests that the uptake of compound by cells and 17β-HSD10 target engagement is not as favourable as others.

Materials and Methods

General Chemistry
All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources (Sigma Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic; Activate Scientific, Prien, Germany; Alfa Aesar, Kandel, Germany; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; Penta Chemicals, Prague, Czech Republic and VWR, Stribrna Skalice, Czech Republic) and they were used without any further purification.
Low boiling point (≥90% 40-60 • C) petroleum ether (PE) was used if not stated otherwise.
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for reaction monitoring was performed on Merck aluminium sheets, silica gel 60 F 254 (Darmstadt, Germany).
Visualisation was performed either via UV (254 nm) or appropriate stain reagent solutions (alternatively in combination of both).
Preparative column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh, 63-200 µm, 60 Å pore size).
Melting points were determined on a Stuart SMP30 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired at 500/126/202 MHz ( 1 H, 13 C and 31 P) on a Varian S500 spectrometer or at 300/75 MHz ( 1 H and 13 C) on a Varian Gemini 300 spectrometer (both produced by Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Chemical shifts δ are given in ppm and referenced to the signal center of solvent peaks (DMSO-d 6 : δ 2.50 ppm and 39.52 ppm for 1 H and 13 C, respectively;  Chloroform-d: δ 7.26 ppm and 77.16 ppm for 1 H and 13 C, respectively), thus indirectly correlated to TMS standard (δ 0 ppm).
Chemical shifts δ for 31 P are given in ppm and referenced to the phosphoric acid standard (δ 0 ppm).
Coupling constants are expressed in Hz.
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded by coupled LC-MS system consisting of Dionex UltiMate 3000 analytical LC system and Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap spectrometer (both produced by ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
As an ion-source, heated electro-spray ionization (HESI) was utilised (setting: sheath gas flow rate 40, aux gas flow rate 10, sweep gas flow rate 2, spray voltage 3.2 kV, capillary temperature 350 • C, aux gas temperature 300 • C, S-lens RF level 50).
Positive ions were monitored in the range of 100-1500 m/z with the resolution set to 140,000.
Obtained mass spectra were processed in Xcalibur 3.0.63
software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay
Cell cytotoxicity was assessed via the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase leakage into the culture medium using a commercially available kit from Pierce (Thermo Scientific, UK, cat no.
88953).
This was carried out in accordance with the kit guidelines, with the activity of LDH being calculated from the change in absorbance at 340 nm as NADH is reduced.
HEK293 cells overexpressing mts17β-HSD10 were cultured in phenol-red free media (10% FBS, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 100 units Penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL Streptomycin and 2 mM L-Glutamine) and seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well (100 µL, 96-well plates).
Cells were then treated with compound of interest at 2 concentrations (25 µM and 100 µM in DMSO) in triplicate.
Treated cells were then incubated at 37 • C and CO 2 (5%) for 24 hours before the LDH assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Spontaneous control (water) and maximum control (lysis buffer) used in accordance with the kit guide.
Absorbance was measured at 490 nm and 680 nm using the SpectraMaxM2e spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices,
