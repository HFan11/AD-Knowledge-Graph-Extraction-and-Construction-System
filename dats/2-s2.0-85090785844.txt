Pre-symptomatic Caspase-1 inhibitor delays cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease and aging
Early therapeutic interventions are essential to prevent Alzheimer Disease (AD).
The association of several inflammation-related genetic markers with AD and the early activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in AD suggest inflammation as a plausible therapeutic target.
Inflammatory Caspase-1 has a significant impact on AD-like pathophysiology and Caspase-1 inhibitor, VX-765, reverses cognitive deficits in AD mouse models.
Here, a one-month presymptomatic treatment of Swedish/Indiana mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP Sw/Ind ) J20 and wild-type mice with VX-765 delays both APP Sw/Ind -and age-induced episodic and spatial memory deficits.
VX-765 delays inflammation without considerably affecting soluble and aggregated amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) levels.
Episodic memory scores correlate negatively with microglial activation.
These results suggest that Caspase-1-mediated inflammation occurs early in the disease and raise hope that VX-765, a previously Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for human CNS clinical trials, may be a useful drug to prevent the onset of cognitive deficits and brain inflammation in AD.

T
here is an urgent need to assess alternative early therapeutic targets against Alzheimer disease (AD).
Aβ, Tau protein, neurotransmitters, and metabolic pathways represent the four main therapeutic targets in AD
Cholinesterase inhibitors and the memantine N-methyl-D-aspartate acid (NMDA) antagonist are standard AD-specific symptomatic drugs which have shown beneficial but modest clinical effects against cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD
Disease modifying immunotherapies against Aβ, predominantly studied in clinical trials, have yet to demonstrate clinical efficacy
Tau therapies are still in early developmental stages
Aging is the most prevalent risk factor for AD and provides insight into disease etiology and progression.
Inflammation is an altered physiological process during senescence and there are agerelated changes in immune-related genes
Genetic and experimental evidence also support a pathogenic role for inflammation in AD
The common mediators between aging and AD are predominantly proinflammatory and involve the increased expression of various cytokines, including interleukin-1-beta converting enzyme (IL-1β), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).
Dysregulation of the inflammatory system in aging and AD could impact brain function and facilitate cognitive impairment.
Early epidemiological studies have shown an association between long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and lower AD risk
NSAIDs reduce inflammation, minimize Aβ accumulation and improve cognition in AD animal models
Different NSAIDs are being considered to improve treatment efficacy
Recently, danger-or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs) have been linked via inflammasome and Caspase-1 (Casp1) activation to the excess IL-1β found in AD brains
Inhibition of the inflammasome Nod-like receptor protein 1 (Nlrp1)
Similarly, knockout or immunotherapy against the inflammasome adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activated and recruitment domain (ASC), decreases Aβ deposition and improve cognitive behaviour in the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 mutant (APP/PS1) AD mouse model
The Nlrp1-Casp1-Casp6 pathway represents an early therapeutic target against AD
This pathway links Nlrp1-and Casp1-mediated inflammation to Casp6-mediated neurodegeneration and AD pathologies including Aβ increased production, Tau cleavage, misfolded protein proteasomal clearance problems, cleavage of several cytoskeletal and synaptic proteins, and IL-1β production
In human primary CNS neuron cultures, Nlrp1 inflammasome-mediated Casp1 activation activates neurodegeneration-related Casp6
Transfection of human neurons with mutant or wild-type APP induces Casp6-dependent, but Aβ-independent, neuritic degeneration
Active Casp6 in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) is sufficient to induce age-dependent cognitive deficits in mice
Theta-burst long-term potentiation cannot be initiated in mice acute brain slice hippocampal CA1 neurons expressing active Casp6
Furthermore, injection of active Casp6 in wild-type mice CA1 neurons impairs synaptic transmission and induces neurodegeneration
Active Casp6 and Nlrp1 are highly increased and co-localized in AD neurons.
Active Casp6, which is abundantly present in AD neuritic plaques, pre-and mature neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads
Inflammasome and Casp6 inhibitors are not yet available for human clinical trials.
However, Casp1 inhibitors have been developed to treat inflammatory diseases
Casp1 knockout in APP/PS1
VX-765, a blood-brain barrier permeable and nontoxic Casp1 inhibitor, reverses spatial and episodic memory deficits, inflammation and synaptic loss, and prevents progressive Aβ accumulation when given at the onset of the J20 mouse symptoms
VX-765 has also been shown to reduce inflammation by suppressing CD4 T-cell death and pyroptosis in HIV
VX-765 is an orally absorbed prodrug of the active metabolite, VRT-043198.
The IC 50 is 3.68 and 9.91 nM
A 50 mg • kg -1 dose of VX-765 reversed cognitive deficits in early symptomatic J20 mice reaching ~2-5 μM concentrations of VX-765 and VRT-043198 in the J20 brain after carotid infusion
Here, we show that VX-765 prevents AD-related memory deficits and pathologies in the J20 AD mouse model.

Results

VX-765 pre-symptomatic treatment delays cognitive deficits.
To determine if sufficient VX-765 reaches the brain after intraperitoneal (IP) injections at 50 mg • kg -1 , VX-765 and VRT-043198 concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS in the plasma, whole brain, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h after a single intraperitoneal injection (Fig.
VX-765 and VRT-043198 reached plasma concentrations 100-and 20,000-fold (Table
VRT-043198 levels surpassed VX-765 concentrations, which indicates the rapid conversion of the prodrug, VX-765, into VRT-043198 in all three compartments.
The t 1/2 half-life of VX-765 was 3.2 h in plasma (Table
The t 1/2 of VRT-043198 was 1 h in brain but could not be calculated in plasma or in CSF.
Although brain VX-765 and VRT-043198 levels were short-lived, the LC-MS/MS 0.025 and 0.049 μM lower limit of quantification for VX-765 for VRT-043198, respectively, prevented the detection of the low nM concentrations inhibiting Casp1.
Nevertheless, these results confirm VX-765's good clinical profile, particularly its stable plasma levels.
Most importantly, the data confirms that VX-765 and VRT-043198 reach the brain at concentrations sufficient to inhibit Casp1 after a single IP injection of VX-765.
To determine whether pre-symptomatic inhibition of Casp1 can slow cognitive deficits, 2-month-old wild-type (WT) and APP Sw/Ind mutant J20 mice were treated for 1 month with 3 injections per week of 50 mg • kg -1 VX-765.
Mice were behaviourally assessed at 4 months of age, 4 weeks after their last injection, when they normally exhibit cognitive deficits and hyperactivity, and again at 6 and 8 months of age (4-, 12-and 20week washout [WO]) (Fig.
To ensure a complete analysis of the J20's behavioural progression, a smaller number of mice were also behaviourally assessed at 8-and 16-week WO.
At each WO period, a subset of animals was euthanized for post-mortem analyses.
Mice were repeatedly tested between 4-and 20-week WO with novel object recognition (NOR) to assess episodic memory.
A strong impairment was found in vehicle-treated J20 compared to vehicle-treated WT mice at 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-and 20-week WO (Fig.
VX-765 treatment protected J20 mice against NOR impairment at all WO periods.
NOR performance in the groups of mice utilized for post-mortem analyses corroborated these findings (Supplementary Fig.
Nevertheless, NOR performance declined between 4-and 20week WO (Fig.
The percentage of NOR impaired mice increased consistently between 4-and 20week WO in VX-765-treated J20 mice (Supplementary Fig.
Together, these results show that VX-765 delays the onset of cognitive impairment in J20 mice by at least 5 months, but there is a gradual loss of VX-765's effect over time, as expected from a drug washout.
In WT mice, NOR performance decreased in 8-month-old (20week WO) compared to 4-month-old (4-week WO) vehicletreated mice (Fig.
In contrast, NOR performance increased in VX-765-treated 8-month-old (20-week WO) mice compared to same age vehicle-treated WT mice, and in VX-765-treated 6month-old (12-week WO) compared to VX-765-treated 4month-old WT mice.
Consistently, the percentage of NOR impaired mice increased between 12-and 20-week WO in the vehicle-treated, but not VX-765-treated WT mice (Supplementary Fig.
These results indicate VX-765 protection against age-dependent cognitive impairment in WT mice.
In mice tested repeatedly to 20-week WO (Fig.
VX-765 treatment attenuated hyperactivity in J20 mice only at 4-week WO but had no effect on WT mice at any WO period.
Even though WT mice gradually moved less with time (Fig.
Therefore, cognitive differences assessed with NOR were not dependent on hyperactivity, motivation or anxiety.
Spatial learning and memory were examined with the Barnes maze at 12-and 20-week WO because spatial memory deficits appear at 6 months of age (12-week WO) in J20 mice.
At 12-week WO, vehicle-treated J20 mice committed significantly more errors locating the target than vehicle-or VX-765-treated WT mice (Fig.
VX-765 treatment prevented this learning deficit in J20 mice and reduced the number of errors committed to near WT levels by the end of the 4-day training phase.
During training, primary latency to find the target did not differ between groups (Supplementary Fig.
During the probe, carried out 24 h after the last training day to assess memory retention, primary latency did not differ between vehicle-or VX-765-treated J20 and vehicle-treated WT groups (Fig.
Nevertheless, vehicle-treated J20 mice committed significantly more errors compared to WT and VX-765 treatment prevented this deficit.
All groups, except the vehicle-treated J20 group, showed a preference towards the target area (Fig.
Similarly, vehicle-, but not VX-765-treated, J20 mice exhibited learning deficits at 20-week WO (Fig.
Vehicle-treated J20 mice were slower and committed more errors to reach the target compared to WT mice, and these deficits were prevented with VX-765 treatment (Fig.
Interestingly, VX-765-treated WT mice at 12-week WO had decreased primary latency and primary errors compared to vehicle-treated WT mice (Fig.
This effect was attenuated at 20-week WO, although both vehicle-and VX-765-treated WT mice showed preference for the target area during the probe test (Fig.
Together, these results indicate that pre-treatment with VX-765 can significantly delay the onset of episodic and spatial memory deficits, but not hyperactivity, in J20 mice up to 20 weeks after treatment.
In addition, VX-765 improves WT mice memory performance.
Together, these preclinical results raise hope that pre-symptomatic treatment with VX-765 might prevent cognitive deficits in humans.
VX-765 pre-symptomatic treatment does not alter APP levels.
To determine if VX-765 affects APP expression and processing and could explain the delay in cognitive deficits, real-time PCR and western blots against full-length APP and APP C-terminal fragments (CTF) were performed.
VX-765 did not alter human APP mRNA levels in the hippocampus at 4-, 12-or 20-week WO (Fig.
Human APP protein levels in J20 mice at 4-week WO were variable and consisted of both mature and immature forms (Fig.
By 20-week WO, variability between J20 mice was reduced and more mature than immature APP was present.
Human APP protein levels, like mRNA levels, were not altered by VX-765 in the hippocampus at 4-or 20-week WO (Fig.
Similar to the absence of human APP expression in WT mouse hippocampus (Fig.
Relative to endogenous mouse APP, APP protein levels, detected with the anti-APP C-terminal antibody that detects both human and mouse protein, were increased significantly in J20 mouse hippocampus confirming APP transgene overexpression (Supplementary Fig.
APP levels were not affected by VX-765.
There were no differences in βCTF and αCTF levels between vehicle-and VX-765-treated J20 mice at 4-or 20-week WO (Supplementary Fig.
Together, these results indicate that alterations in the APP Sw/Ind transgene expression cannot account for VX-765's beneficial cognitive effects.
VX-765 pre-symptomatic treatment delays glial activation.
Microglial activation has long been implicated in AD etiology and is an early pathological feature preceding Aβ deposition in J20 mice
Microglial activation involves increased inflammatory cytokine production, activation-dependent morphological changes and increased cell numbers
Iba1, a marker for activated microglia and inflammation
Iba1-positive microglia increased in the hippocampus and cortex of vehicletreated J20, compared to WT mice, at all WO periods (Fig.
Vehicle-treated J20 mice contained a lower percentage of resting type I and higher amount of type II activated microglia compared to WT mice in the hippocampus and cortex across all WO periods (Fig.
VX-765 treatment reverted the profile in J20 mice back to a near WT profile at 4week WO, but it slowly shifted from a resting to an activated state morphologically similar to vehicle-treated J20 mice from 12-week WO onwards.
Type III, amoeboid-appearing, microglia were low at 4-and 12-week WO but significantly higher in vehicle-and VX-765-treated J20 mice at 20-week WO.
Type IV microglia, which were rarely seen in WT and vehicle-treated J20 mice, were elevated in the hippocampus of VX-765-treated J20 mice at 20week WO.
To determine whether type IV microglia constitute phagocytic microglia, the type IV microglial profile observed at 20-week WO was further characterized using CD68 to identify phagocytic microglia and macrophages.
CD68 positive staining was sparse in the hippocampus and cortex of J20 mice.
Only a few CD68 positive cells resembling type IV microglia were identified, while the majority of cells that were CD68 positive resembled perivascular macrophages (Supplementary Fig.
CD68 was seen only in VX-765-treated J20 mice: four out of the five VX-765-treated J20 mice showed CD68 positive staining whereas no staining was found in any vehicle-treated J20 (Supplementary Fig,
This suggests that despite seeing increased Iba1-positive morphologically-identified phagocytic microglia after VX-765 treatment, the lack of CD68 staining makes it unlikely that microglial phagocytosis plays a direct role in VX-765's mechanism of action.
Nevertheless, overall these results suggest that VX-765 can reduce microglial activation up to 4 months in the hippocampus and 5 months in the cortex of J20 mice and exert a long-term change on the morphology of microglia.
Hippocampal glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels (Fig.
Comparatively, immunopositive GFAP astrogliosis (Supplementary Fig.
VX-765 treatment prevented astrogliosis until 8-and 12-week WO in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively.
The discrepancy between the western blot and immunostaining data at 4-and 20-week WO is possibly due to differences in the regions of interest analysed, or the dilution of GFAP with other cell proteins during extraction.
Overall, these results suggest that VX-765 pre-treatment delays GFAP astrogliosis for 3 months in J20 mice.
VX-765 pre-treatment normalizes IL-1β levels.
Activated Casp1 cleaves the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 into their active states, leading to IL-1β-mediated inflammation through microglial activation and astrogliosis.
IL-1β and IL-18 were assessed to determine whether Casp1 is directly implicated in inflammation in the J20 brain.
There were no differences in hippocampal IL-1β and IL-18 mRNA levels between groups across any WO period, except for increased Il-1β mRNA in the J20 hippocampus that was normalized with VX-765 treatment at 16-week WO (Fig.
Pro-, active (Δ) and total (pro + active) IL-1β protein levels were measured by western blot in the hippocampus and cortex at 4-and 20-week WO (Fig.
While hippocampal pro IL-1β levels remained unchanged (Fig.
This trend of increased active and total hippocampal IL-1β levels was not observed with VX-765 treatment.
Active IL-1β levels were significantly higher in vehicletreated J20 cortex but were normalized with VX-765 treatment at 20-week WO (Fig.
Total protein IL-1β levels did not differ between treatment groups in the hippocampus at 4-, 12-, or 20-week WO when measured by ELISA (Fig.
However, hippocampal IL-1β levels seemed to increase in vehicle-treated J20 versus WT mice at 12-and 20-week WO.
This increase was not observed after VX-765 treatment.
Cortical IL-1β levels did not differ between groups at any WO.
The low constitutive expression of IL-1β
Quantitative PCR was also performed to determine whether inflammasome-related proteins or AD-associated caspases were upregulated in the J20 hippocampus at the mRNA level.
Nlrp1, Nlrp3 and Asc hippocampal mRNA levels did not differ between the three treatment groups at any of the WO periods, although  there was a trend towards increased Nlrp1 mRNA levels in vehicle-, but not VX-765-treated, J20 mice at 16-and 20-week WO (Supplementary Fig.
Furthermore, no differences were observed in inflammation-related Casp1, Casp6, Casp11 and apoptosis-related Casp3 hippocampal mRNA levels (Fig.
A western blot to detect full-length and processed active p33 and p20 Casp1 subunits was performed with proteins from vehicle-treated WT and J20 and VX-765-treated J20 cortex at 20week WO (Supplementary Fig.
Full-length Casp1 was detected in both WT and J20 mice at equivalent levels (Supplementary Fig.
VX-765 treatment reduced full-length Casp1 levels slightly compared to vehicle-treated J20 mice, but this did not reach statistical significance.
Cleaved-Casp1 active subunits were not detected in mouse cortical proteins despite being easily detected in the positive control tumour colon proteins and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/nigericin-treated J774A.1 microglial cell culture medium.
Our inability to detect active Casp1 subunits, which contrasts with results obtained previously in the 16-month-old APP/PS1 mouse brains
VX-765 pre-symptomatic treatment does not alter Aβ levels.
Aβ plaques, a pathological hallmark of AD, begin to develop in the dentate gyrus and cortex of APP-overexpressing J20 mice between 5 and 7 months of age, with widespread deposition by 8-10 months of age
In situ, Aβ deposition was concentrated in the SLM and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cortical retrosplenial area in J20 mice and appeared unchanged after VX-765 treatment by 20-week WO (Fig.
Aβ gradually accumulated with age and was more elevated in the hippocampus than cortex in J20 mice (Supplementary Fig.
VX-765 significantly decreased Aβ staining density only in the cortex at 12-week WO, although Aβ staining seemed lower in the hippocampus in some WO periods, and from 4-to 12-week WO in the cortex (Fig.
ELISA-measured RIPA-soluble total Aβ levels were higher in the hippocampus than the cortex (Fig.
There were no significant differences in RIPA-soluble Aβ 38 , Aβ 40 , Aβ 42 or total Aβ levels between vehicle-and VX-765treated J20 mice in the hippocampus or cortex across all WO periods (Supplementary Fig.
However, RIPA-soluble Aβ 42 / total Aβ ratio was significantly higher in vehicle-compared to VX-765-treated hippocampus in J20 mice at 20-week WO (Fig.
Similar to Aβ immunohistological results, formic acid (FA)soluble total Aβ levels increased after 12-week WO but did not differ between vehicle and VX-765 treatment in the hippocampus or cortex of J20 mice at any WO period (Fig.
Together, these results suggest that pre-treatment with VX-765 does not delay the progressive deposition of Aβ in J20 mice.
VX-765 pre-symptomatic treatment does not alter IDE and Nep.
Aβ-degrading insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (Nep) were measured to assess whether VX-765 affects Aβ clearance enzymes
IDE mRNA (Supplementary Fig.
Similarly, Nep mRNA (Supplementary Fig.
Since these two important Aβ-clearing enzymes are unchanged and Aβ levels are also unaffected after VX-765 treatment, it is likely that VX-765 does not act on Aβ clearance.
Glial activation, not Aβ, associates with cognitive deficits.
Our data suggests that APP overexpression in the J20 mouse causes cognitive deficits through inflammation, rather than Aβ deposition.
Indeed, there was a strong negative correlation between Iba1-positive microglial density and NOR discrimination index in the hippocampus and cortex of WT and J20 mice (Fig.
There was, however, no relationship between total IL-1β levels and NOR behaviour (Fig.
Neither Aβ staining density nor ELISAmeasured total RIPA-soluble Aβ levels correlated with NOR discrimination index in J20 mice (Fig.
These results suggest that microglial activation, rather than Aβ, is associated with cognitive deficits in the J20 mouse.

Discussion
Our data indicates that VX-765 is an effective treatment, without a sustained administration, in delaying cognitive deterioration in an AD mouse model.
A 1-month pre-symptomatic administration of VX-765 can delay cognitive impairment by at least 5 months in J20 mice.
Conversion of mice age and time of treatment to human age suggests that a 3-4-year presymptomatic treatment in humans could prevent age-dependent cognitive deficits for ~10-15 years
Only a few studies implemented similar experimental paradigms
Van Dam and colleagues observed improved acquisition and spatial memory in the Morris water maze at 3-week WO with a 2-month galantamine or memantine pre-symptomatic treatment of APP23 mice
Smith and colleagues observed continued improved performance in NOR in a 1-month pre-treatment with saracatinib, but not memantine, in APP/PS1 at 3-week WO
Therefore, it is impressive to observe the VX-765's disease modifying effect on preventing episodic and spatial memory deficits for up to 5 months after treatment.
These results support the notion that successfully treating AD requires early intervention.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the use of VX-765 is not limited to a preventative effect.
The Casp1 inhibitor, VX-765, can reverse episodic and spatial memory deficits when therapeutically given after symptom onset in J20 mice
Taken together, these studies suggest that VX-765 may be beneficial in both prevention and treatment of AD.
Preventing cognitive decline with VX-765 suggests that mutant APP expression in J20 mice causes cognitive impairment via Casp1-mediated inflammation.
Our current and previous studies suggest the following order of pathological events: neuronal APP Sw/Ind expression under the PDGF-β promoter → neuronal degeneration → increased microglial activation → cognitive impairment → Aβ accumulation and deposition.
Whether inflammation is controlled by VX-765 in neurons, microglia or both is debatable.
Microglia are implicated in this model since J20 mice have increased Iba1-positive microglia numbers as early as 4 months of age and microglial density is strongly correlated with declining cognitive performance.
VX-765 normalizes this; therefore, we can conclude that the action of VX-765 is, in part, through microglia.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the beneficial action of VX-765 preventative treatment targets neurons.
Stress by serum deprivation or overexpression of WT or mutant APP in primary human neuron cultures induces a Nlrp1-Casp1-Casp6 neurodegenerative pathway resulting in the aggregation of several proteins including Tau, ubiquitin and microtubule-associated protein 2
We hypothesized that neuronal Casp1 activation leads to Casp6-mediated neurodegeneration, increases Aβ production
The fact that Il-1β levels are extremely low in J20 mice brains (shown here and previously
VX-765's beneficial effect on normal mice exposed a subtle age-related cognitive decline underscoring pathways common to aging and AD, albeit accelerated in AD.
VX-765 eliminated agedependent episodic and spatial memory decline in WT mice.
Recent work has shown that the age-dependent breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, leading to the influx of toxic products into the brain, can induce neuronal dysfunction and impair cognition
This can potentially lead to inflammaging, a lowgrade inflammation that occurs in aging
Given VX-765's effect on delaying microglial activation in J20 mice, it is not unreasonable to suggest that VX-765 acts to inhibit neurodegenerative and inflammatory pathways common in ADand age-related cognitive decline.
The in vivo activation of inflammasomes and Casp1 is a transient process.
The generation of the active, inflammasomebound, Casp1 p33/p10 species is followed by a second selfcleavage event releasing Casp1 p20/p10 subunits from the inflammasome
The p20/p10 subunits are unstable leading to their release from the inflammasome, thereby deactivating Casp1.
Casp1 mRNA and protein did not change, and were unaltered by VX-765, in the J20 compared to WT brain.
Furthermore, active Casp1 subunits were undetectable in brains.
It is possible that (1) 8-month-old J20 brain inflammation is insufficient to detect active Casp1 subunits by western blots, (2) active Casp1 subunits are rapidly secreted and degraded in the extracellular milieu of the brain, or (3) VX-765 against Casp1 occurs in neurons where levels are very low.
Only Heneka and colleagues
Their mice were twice the age (16 months) of J20 mice (8 months), an age where amyloid deposits are quite extensive compared to the younger J20.
Even if we could detect the active Casp1 subunits in J20 brains, we would not expect a change with VX-765, since it is a reversible inhibitor and should not stop Casp1 processing.
Nevertheless, the role of Casp1 is undeniable in the J20 model since J20 on a Casp1 null background fails to develop cognitive deficits
One limitation in this study is the low effect of VX-765 on IL-1β.
We expected VX-765 to directly reduce IL-1β
Possibly.
IL-1β levels were low, although within the detection limit, because of the young age or lack of priming in J20 brains.
IL-1β activation depends on priming that leads to the transcriptional activation of IL1B
Aβ is a priming agonist that induces inflammasome activation
Alternatively, VX-765 may exert its effect on neurons, where Il-1β levels are low.
Although we
Aβ does not appear to be responsible for cognitive deficits in J20 mice.
Despite its important delay in cognitive decline, preventative VX-765 treatment did not alter brain Aβ in J20 brains.
No association was observed between soluble and insoluble Aβ levels and NOR performance in J20 mice.
Therefore, our data are inconsistent with the amyloid hypothesis that presents Aβ accumulation as the primary event to neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction
Consistent with our findings, episodic memory impairments in J20 mice develop well before Aβ accumulation
Finally, a systematic review of transgenic AD mice corroborates no overall correlation between Aβ levels and cognitive function
How these observations translate clinically remains to be seen but they are consistent with several findings.
First, elderly patients with high amyloid levels do not necessarily suffer from AD
Second, amyloid pathology precedes dementia by decades
While some see this as evidence of causation, the possibility that amyloid deposition is merely an associated event coinciding with or exacerbating disease cannot be excluded.
Finally, immunotherapies that strongly decrease Aβ levels have so far not improved AD severity, duration or progression
In contrast, VX-765 preventative treatment delays microglial activation and suggests that altering the inflammatory milieu early is critical and can induce disease modifying effects to improve cognition.
Recent clinical trials with NSAIDs have disappointedly failed to show beneficial effects
NSAIDs prevented cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 AD mice, independently from Aβ levels or Iba1-positive microglial activation effects
Therefore, VX-765 differs significantly from NSAIDs, notwithstanding the different targets of NSAIDs (i.e.
cyclooxygenases) and VX-765 (i.e.
Casp1).
VX-765 can reduce microglial and astroglial activation
Fenamate NSAIDs inhibiting the Nlrp3 inflammasome and protecting against amyloid-injected rat or the AD 3x transgenic mouse
Together, these results indicate that preventing Casp1mediated inflammation pre-symptomatically with a VX-765 short-term treatment is sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive deficits in J20 mice.
It is likely that VX-765 may prevent an early APP mutant-mediated and Casp1-dependent deleterious neuronal pathway that causes cognitive deficits and also controls subsequent microglial activation.
In the future, it would be interesting to assess the molecular patterns associated with VX-765 treatment in J20 mice in hopes of identifying novel therapeutic targets against cognitive deficits.

Methods
Experimental design and VX-765 treatment.
All animal procedures followed the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines and were approved by the McGill University Animal Care committee.
Male and female J20 mice (JAX Stock No. 006293, Jackson Laboratories, ME, USA) and their C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) littermates were used.
Mice were group-housed between 2 and 4 mice per cage in macrolon cages under 12-h reverse light-dark cycle and controlled environmental conditions.
Food and water available ad libitum.
VX-765 (Adooq Bioscience, Irvine, CA, USA) was dissolved 5 mg • ml -1 in 20% cremophor in dH 2 O 60 (Sigma-Aldrich, ON, Canada) and administered IPWT and J20 mice received three injections per week of either 50 mg • kg -1 VX-765 or 20% cremophor vehicle for 4 weeks between 2 and 3 months of age.
Mice were longitudinally followed starting 4 weeks after the last injection [4-week washout (WO)], then every other month at 12-and 20-week WO (6 and 8 months of age, respectively).
Intermediate 8-and 16-week WO periods were also looked at with a smaller number of mice.
After each WO period, animals were randomly chosen, independent of behavioural performance, for sacrifice and assigned to either histological or biochemical analysis (Fig.
VX-765 and VRT-043198 pharmacokinetics.
Plasma, whole brain and CSF concentrations of VX-765 and its active metabolite, VRT-043198, were determined by LC-MS/MS at Paraza Pharma (Montreal, QC, Canada).
Fourteen C57BL/6J female mice received a single IP dose of 50 mg • kg -1 VX-765 and 2 mice per time point were euthanized at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8 and 24 h post-injection.
Mice were isoflurane anesthetized to collect CSF and perform a cardiac puncture followed by whole body perfusion with PBS.
Plasma samples were extracted 1:1 in spiking solution and internal standard solution containing 0.1 μM glyburide in acetonitrile.
Brain and CSF samples were extracted 1:1 in spiking solution and internal standard solution containing 0.2 μM labetalol in 50:50 methanol:acetonitrile.
Samples were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the plasma supernatant diluted 1:1 and the brain and CSF supernatant diluted 1:2 in H 2 O, and 5 μl was injected into a Quantis LC-MS/MS system for analysis.
Behavioural analysis.
Open-field and novel object recognition (NOR) were measured at all WO periods.
The Barnes maze was assessed at 12-and 20-week WO.
Open field: Mice were placed in an open-field chamber, composed of a plexiglass box with no ceiling and white floor, and allowed to explore for 5 min.
NOR: Mice were pre-exposed to two identical objects in the open-field chamber for 5 min.
Two hours after pre-exposure, mice were placed back into the chamber and exposed to one familiar object and one novel object for 5 min (test phase).
Mice were exposed to a specific object only once across multiple test sessions.
Barnes maze: Learning acquisition (days 1-4)-each mouse was trained to find the target and enter the escape box within 180 s.
Four trials per day, ~15 min apart, were performed for 4 consecutive days.
Probe (day 5)-a single, 90 s trial was performed on each mouse to measure primary latency and number of errors to reach the blocked target.
Target hole location was changed between the two separate test sessions.
Behavioural scoring was blinded to mouse genotype and treatment.
Immunohistochemistry and quantification.
Mice for immunohistochemistry were isoflurane anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (Sigma-Aldrich).
Brains were post-fixed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (ThermoFisher Scientific, ON, Canada) and transferred to 70% ethanol for paraffin embedding and sectioning at 4 μm.
Tissue slides underwent heat-induced antigen retrieval with citrate or EDTA buffer.
Immunostaining was performed using the Dako Autostainer Plus slide processor and EnVision Flex system (Dako, ON, Canada).
Sections were peroxidase treated, blocked in Serum-Free Protein Block, and immunostained with the following antibodies: 1:2000 rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, VA, USA), 1:500 rat anti-CD68 (clone FA-11, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 1:8000 rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako) and 1:2000 rabbit anti-Aβ 1-40 (F25276, laboratory developed).
CD68 antibody required an additional rabbit anti-rat IgG/HRP secondary reagent (Dako) incubation.
Immunoreactivity was revealed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and diaminobenzidine and hematoxylin counterstain.
Sections were digitally scanned with MIRAX SCAN (Zeiss, ON, Canada) and used for subsequent analyses.
Representative images have only been cropped and did not undergo any post-processing.
Iba1-positive microglia were quantified using a modified version of an areaspecific counting frame
The number of Iba1-positive cells per mm 3 in the anterior CA1 region and cortex was estimated across four sections, spaced 60 μm apart.
Microglial activation level was determined based on morphological measurements
Aβ 1-40 and GFAP immunostaining density was measured across four sections using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Quantification was blinded to treatment and genotype.
Protein extraction.
Mice for biochemical analyses were isoflurane anesthetized, sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the hippocampus and cortex dissected out and immediately frozen on dry ice.
Brain tissue was homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH: 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, with protease inhibitors), and supernatants placed in Laemmli (5% 2-β mercaptoethanol with protease inhibitors).
For Casp1 positive control, J774A.1 murine macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Wisent, QC, Canada).
Twenty-four hours before treatment, cells were plated in 6-well plates, washed with PBS, and then treated with 200 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Millipore, ON, Canada) in DMEM for 4 h.
Nigericin (Sigma) or an equivalent volume of DMSO/ethanol (1:1) was then added to the media to reach a final concentration of 13.8 μM and incubated an additional 2 h.
Culture medium was collected, centrifuged at 94 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris, and proteins from 500 μl of supernatant were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 40 μl of loading buffer.
Cells were washed with PBS and harvested in RIPA buffer.
Western blot and quantification.
Twenty to sixty micrograms of protein or 16 μl of precipitated protein from culture medium were separated on SDS-PAGE or 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with MES buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Membranes were probed with the following antibodies: 1:1000 mouse anti-Aβ 1-16 (6E10) (BioLegend, CA, USA), 1:2000 rabbit anti-APP C-terminus (A8717) (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:1000 rabbit anti-neprilysin (Nep, Abcam, ON, Canada), 1:500 rabbit anti-insulin degrading enzyme (IDE, Abcam), 1:3000 rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako), 1:1000 rabbit anti-IL-1β (Abcam), 1:1000 rat anti-Caspase-1 (clone 4B4.2.1, kindly provided by Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) and 1:1000 mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunoreactivity was revealed with 1:5000 HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA or GE Healthcare BioSciences, NJ, USA) and detected with ECL (GE Amersham, ON, Canada).
Signals were visualized with the ImageQuant LAS 4000 imaging system and densitometric analyses were performed with Image Gauge analysis software 3.0 (Fujifilm USA, NY, USA).
Protein extracts from three independent mice in each group were run together on each blot.
Protein levels were normalized to β-actin and expressed as a percentage relative to the vehicle-treated WT group, except for APP which was compared to the vehicletreated J20 group.
Representative full blots are shown in the Source data file.
ELISA.
ELISA samples were prepared in RIPA described above.
RIPA-insoluble pellets were further extracted in 70% formic acid (FA) in dH 2 O. FA was evaporated in a speed vacuum, and the resulting pellet was solubilized in 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.
IL-1β and Aβ levels (which include Aβ 38 , Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 ) were measured using Meso Scale Discovery ELISA kits (Rockville, MD, USA).
Standards and samples were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols and run in duplicate.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR.
RNA was extracted with Qiazol and purified using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, CA, USA).
RNA quality and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer (DS-11 FX+, DeNovix, DE, USA) and RNA was reverse transcribed using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Real-time PCR experiments were performed with SYBR Green Taq Mastermix (Quanta BioSciences, MD, USA) in a real-time cycler ABI 7500 Fast Block (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
Primer sequences are described in the supplementary material.
Casp1 (MP201790) and Casp6 (MP201796) primers were purchased from Origene (MD, USA).
Results are presented as individual data points using the 2 -ΔCt method
Statistics and reproducibility.
Mouse behavioural experiments were performed on five independent cohorts generated at different times.
Each cohort produced similar results with low variability between experiments.
Post-mortem histological and biochemical analyses were performed on all cohorts.
Immunohistochemistry was performed within each of the five independent experiments and produced similar results when repeated across each experiment.
Western blots, ELISA and PCR were performed all together after all behavioural testing was finished and when tissues from all WO periods were available.
All mice are indicated as individual data points in the figures and values are expressed as mean and s.e.m.
Statistical analyses for behaviour were performed with regular or repeated-measures two-way ANOVA and either Dunnett's post hoc compared to WT + vehicle (used between treatment groups within WO periods) or Bonferroni's post hoc (used between same group across different WO periods).
Histological and biochemical analyses were performed with unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc compared to WT + vehicle or J20 + vehicle.
Statistical significance for group comparisons was set to p < 0.05.
Pearson correlation and linear regression was performed between behavioural performance and Iba1-positive microglial density, IL-1β levels, Aβ staining density and total RIPA-soluble Aβ levels.
Given the numerous correlations, a Bonferroni's adjustment was used to reduce the significance level to p < 0.01
All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA).
Total numbers (n), F and p values are described in the figure legends.
