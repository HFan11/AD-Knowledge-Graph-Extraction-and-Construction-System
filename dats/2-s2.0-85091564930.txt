SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD
This systematic review examined whether event-related potentials (ERPs) during higher cognitive processing can detect subtle, early signs of neurodegenerative disease.
Original, empirical studies retrieved from PsycINFO and PubMed were reviewed if they analyzed patterns in cognitive ERPs (³150ms post-stimulus) differentiating mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), or cognitively intact elders who carry AD risk through the Apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele (ε4+) from healthy older adult controls (HC).
The 100 studies meeting inclusion criteria (MCI=47; AD=47; ε4+=6) analyzed N200, P300, N400, and occasionally, later components.
While there was variability across studies, patterns of reduced amplitude and delayed latency were apparent in pathological aging, consistent with AD-related brain atrophy and cognitive impairment.
These effects were particularly evident in advanced disease progression (i.e., AD > MCI) and in later ERP components measured during complex tasks.
Although ERP studies in intact ε4+ elders are thus far scarce, a similar pattern of delayed latency was notable, along with a contrasting pattern of increased amplitude, consistent with compensatory neural activation.
This limited work suggests ERPs might be able to index early neural changes indicative of future cognitive decline in otherwise healthy elders.
As ERPs are also accessible and affordable relative to other neuroimaging methods, their addition to cognitive assessment might substantively enhance early identification and characterization of neural dysfunction, allowing opportunity for earlier differential diagnosis and targeting of intervention.
To evaluate this possibility there is urgent need for well-powered studies assessing late cognitive ERPs during complex tasks, particularly in healthy elders at risk for cognitive decline.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is closely associated with an accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and brain atrophy
Symptoms of the disease include marked cognitive decline from baseline functioning in areas such as planning, problem solving, memory, language, and orientation, as well as impairment in completing instrumental activities of daily living
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a prodromal form of AD due to the comparable though less severe neuropathology and cognitive decline; approximately 10% of those with MCI convert to AD each year
Early detection is especially important in AD as its neuropathological hallmarks may be present decades before onset of symptoms
One primary factor associated with risk for AD is carrying the Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) ε4 allele.
Those who carry one of two copies of the ε4 allele have a 3-4x greater than average risk of AD, while those who carry both ε4 alleles have 10x greater risk
The investigation of neural biomarkers, such as those using neuroimaging measures for AD is an important and burgeoning field.
A biomarker is a measure that offers an objective index of structural or functional differences that can be used to predict or track a disease
Although methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dominate the literature, electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) hold particular promise due to their accessibility, affordability, and superior temporal specificity compared with other neuroimaging modalities.
Thus, ERPs could be a valuable addition to cognitive assessment in identifying and tracking disease onset and progression.

EEG is a neurophysiological methodology in which electrical activity of the brain (i.e., summed postsynaptic potentials) is recorded via electrodes placed on the scalp.
ERPs are an application of EEG that specifically time-lock such electrophysiological activity to a stimulus or a behavioral response.
The amplitude and latency of changes in voltage provide insight into the magnitude and timing of information processing in the brain
The present systematic review focuses on 'cognitive' ERPs occurring at least 150ms post-stimulus, reflecting higher order cognitive processes such as executive functioning, memory encoding and retrieval, and semantic processing
Previous research on earlier sensory components has relatively consistently revealed intact early components in groups with AD compared to healthy older adult groups, suggesting that more automatic perception of stimuli may remain intact, while more complex cognitive processing of such stimuli declines, at least in mild to moderate AD
Considering ERPs as biomarkers of AD-related neuropathology could expand upon the spatial knowledge provided by structural and functional MRI studies and enhance understanding of the temporal nature of communication and connectivity of neural networks associated with AD.
Most recent neuroimaging studies have used MRI, fMRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) to examine MCI and AD.
Overall, AD studies demonstrate reduced regional brain volume and cortical thickness, and decreased activation in the amygdala, hippocampus, inferior and medial temporal lobes, anterior cingulate cortex, and regions of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., orbitofrontal) and parietal lobes
Additionally, while typical aging may be accompanied by a widespread decline in functional connectivity, exaggerated decline is observed in those with AD, especially in regions associated with the Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 6 default mode network, such as posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobules, lateral temporal cortices, and the hippocampi
Findings in MCI are more varied, sometimes indicating increased activation and other times indicating decreased activation in AD-relevant regions, such as the medial temporal lobe and the default mode network.
This variability is largely attributed to task differences (e.g., cognitive demand) and variation in MCI and AD severity across studies
Studies of early indicators of neural decline in healthy, cognitively intact APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers are scarce.
The available research with fMRI suggests that cognitively intact ε4 carriers exhibit a period of increased, compensatory activation relative to their lower risk counterparts
Yet, over time, activation in ε4-steadily increases while in ε4+ it decreases, becoming more comparable with what is seen with MCI and AD, indicative of advancing neuropathology
Whereas fMRI has exceptional spatial localization, ERPs compliment and expand upon this research by providing a more direct and temporally precise understanding of neural processes.
While fMRI signals are a proxy for neural activity, generated seconds afterward by capillary-level blood oxygenation, ERPs directly capture neuronal activity with millisecond-level precision
Furthermore, individuals that are unable or unwilling to undergo MRI scans can still participate in EEG sessions.
This non-invasive and relatively low-cost option is viable for individuals with medical devices such as pacemakers, joint replacements and other implants, high body mass index, tattoos, extensive dental work, and anxiety about confined spaces.
These advantages make EEG and ERPs particularly appealing as a form of early detection of AD risk.

Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD
This present study is a systematic review of MCI, AD, and intact APOE ε4-carrier groups relative to healthy controls with ERPs reflecting higher cognitive functions (defined herein as >150 ms post-stimulus onset).
While reviews of ERPs in AD have been conducted
Although a 2017 paper examined ERPs associated with MCI
The present review therefore systematically highlights specific patterns in the literature relative to each individual component examined, investigates variability and contradictory results; evaluates demographic and task-related variables that may account for variable findings; and discusses pattern similarities and differences across components that can help direct future research attempting to distinguish these groups.

Article Selection
Figure
As the first step of article evaluation, duplicate articles were deleted.
The remaining returns were then evaluated based on title and abstract, and were only included in the next step if they: 1) were original, empirical studies, 2) analyzed cognitive event-related potentials (i.e., 150ms post-stimulus or later), 3) employed a sample of participants with MCI, AD, or intact participants deemed at risk for AD as carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, and 4) compared an MCI/AD/APOE ε4 group with a healthy older adult control group.
Studies that survived this title and abstract review were subjected to full article evaluation.
Studies excluded at this phase failed criteria for the following reasons: nonempirical study (n=16), no between-group comparison of cognitive ERPs (n=20), no AD/MCI group (n=12), no healthy older adult control group (n=12), a sample size < five participants per group (n=1), use of non-traditional MCI subjects (e.g., MCI in stroke patients; n=3), and single trial methodology not comparable with other studies (n=1).
Note that some excluded papers failed multiple inclusion criteria, but each was recorded under one category for simplicity.
The final samples included in the review were 47 MCI, 47 AD, and 6 APOE ε4 studies.

Results
The 47 MCI, 47 AD, and six APOE studies reviewed herein are described in Table
These studies overall identified several cognitive ERP components that may be altered in the progression of AD-related neuropathology.
The most frequently investigated components were N200 (21 MCI, 13 AD, 4 APOE), P300 (30 MCI, 33 AD, 5 APOE), and N400 (6 MCI, 16 AD, 1 APOE).
Although rarely investigated, some studies examined the late positive component (LPC, aka P600), the parietal old/new effect, late slow waves, the late positive potential (LPP), and some other uncommon components (e.g., N250r, C250, contingent negative variation (CNV)).
Study of components with less than three supporting articles are not comprehensively discussed [e.g.,
Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD  [Table
The actual differences between comparison groups may even be greater than we report, since some studies could not be tabulated due to only reporting age ranges; in some cases there were greater extremes than we report (e.g., MCI studies youngest reported age was 40 years).

MMSE Scores
The Mini- may have contributed to differences in study outcomes (see Tables
For example, Pedroso et al.'s

Task Paradigms
Oddball paradigms were the most frequently used task across all groups, accounting for language, semantic processing, and recognition memory
Some of the studies also included LPC, N300, and P300 components.
Only one of the six healthy APOE group studies (17%) also used a semantic task, examining N400.
This was the most complex of the tasks, and the latest ERP component employed with these healthy subjects.
Finally, six studies examined episodic memory (MCI: 4/47, AD: 2/47), primarily focusing on N400, and other late components (e.g., LPP, late frontal effect (LFE), parietal effect (PE)).

Electrode Sites
The vast majority of studies, particularly those analyzing N200 and P300 components, analyzed only midline electrodes (N200: 80% of studies providing electrode information, MCI:
15/18, AD: 9/13, and APOE: 4/4; P300: 77%; MCI: 21/29, AD: 25/32, and APOE: 5/5).
Lateral sites, however, may be uniquely sensitive to age-and AD pathology-related neural changes
Indeed, one study with healthy APOE groups
Lateral electrodes may also best detect group differences for particularly lateralized tasks, since midline electrodes might underestimate or exclude lateral activity, depending on source distance from midline.
For example, in a tool-using gesture paradigm
Overall, group differences were generally found at sites consistent with typical component maxima, where reported.
For example, with N200, including both fronto-central and parietal electrodes, revealed differences between MCI and HC groups; these reflect different underlying processes in N200 and may be differentially impacted by pathological aging processes
P300 differences were primarily found at parietal sites (the usual maxima)
Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD and sometimes at centro-parietal sites.
Yet, adding frontal electrodes was revealing in the studies that did so, in part due to capture of anterior age-related shifts
Specifically, frontal electrodes frequently added group discrimination for N200, P300, N400, and LPC components, in addition to findings at component-specific maxima sites.
This was particularly notable for N400, despite its typically centro-parietal maxima.
Similar frontal shift-related effects were apparent in some P300 studies, but P300a and P300b were rarely distinguished, which would be important in order to draw meaningful conclusions.
Notably, few AD studies reported the loci of group differences.
Finally, some studies combined electrodes (i.e., ROI approach), but the number of electrodes combined was much larger for late than for early components.
Specifically, N200 and P300 ROIs typically included 3 to 4 electrodes (group averages = 3.0 to 4.1).
In contrast, ROIs for N400 and LPC included 2 to 7 times more electrodes (N400 group average ranged from 11 to 32; LPC group average ranged from 13.2 to 14), making the source of these ROIs much less specific.

Event-Related Potential Results
An overview of the general pattern of findings for all ERP components investigated by at least three studies in this review are summarized in Table
The most common trends within each component are summarized by diagnostic group to highlight patterns both within and across groups.
Toward capturing non-majority patterns that may impact future research, trends evident in the remainder of the studies are also summarized within each ERP component and diagnostic group.
[Table
Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 16

N200
The N200 component is a negative-going wave that typically peaks within 100-300ms post-stimulus and can be broken down into two subcomponents: N200a (i.e., the mismatch negativity; MMN) and N200b.
N200a is thought to reflect automated sensory processing, specifically in response to novel stimuli
N200b tends to index conscious and intentional attention to stimuli, especially those that deviate from the expected stimulus (e.g., oddball paradigms)
Within inhibitory control paradigms, N200b also reflects alerting to the need to activate inhibition preceding motor inhibition
While many studies investigating the N200 component did not separate N200a and N200b, those that specifically isolated N200a (i.e., mismatch negativity) were excluded from the present review due to the earlier, more automatic and sensory nature of this component
Comprehensive reviews of the N200a subcomponent with age and AD have already been reported
A few studies assessed specific subcomponents of the N200 ERP including N2pc, N2cc, and N250r
Given the limited research with these ERPs they are not discussed in the review; see Tables
amplitudes were smallest in progressive MCI compared to non-progressive MCI and healthy controls
These studies primarily used more complex tasks than the traditional oddball Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 17 paradigm, including Go/No-Go and Flanker tasks (i.e., 3/4; 75%).
Of the 12 studies that did not detect group differences, 50% used simple visual or auditory oddball paradigms, suggesting that differences in N200 amplitudes may not be sufficiently evident using simple oddball paradigms.

MCI
The remaining two studies, both from the same laboratory, in fact reported larger N200 amplitudes in the MCI group [i.e., 11%; 106,107].
One of these studies used particularly uneven sample sizes, with 91 MCI participants and 30 HC
Notably, these MCI participants were at the young end of the range for these studies and at the high end for MMSE.
This may reflect early compensatory activation that precedes decline

AD Amplitude.
Eleven studies analyzed N200 amplitude differences between AD and HC, nine of which reported no significant between-group differences [i.e., 82%;
All but one of these studies employed auditory oddball tasks.
In contrast, the two studies that reported significant differences both used more complex executive function tasks; both demonstrated smaller N200 amplitudes in AD compared to HC groups [i.e., 18%; 84,145].
Specifically, Wang et al.
Both of these tasks tap inhibitory control and attention in a visual modality, thereby differing in both modality and stimulus complexity from an auditory oddball paradigm.

Cognitively Intact APOE ɛ4
Carriers Amplitude.
Four of the six APOE studies investigated N200 amplitude; all four reported no significant differences between ε4 carriers and non-carriers
Yet, all studies used simple auditory oddball or odor identification tasks, which as noted even with MCI and AD where cognitive symptoms are present, may not be ideal for detecting AD-related differences in N200 amplitude.
Furthermore, very high risk) compared to ɛ4/ɛ3 (i.e., heterozygotes; high risk).
Yet, ɛ4 homozygotes only differed from low risk ɛ3/ɛ3 (i.e., ɛ4-) participants at a trend level
The samples in all these studies were quite small, precluding strong conclusions.

P300
The P300 component is a positive-going wave that peaks between 250-700ms poststimulus.
As with the N200 component, P300 is divided into P300a and P300b subcomponents.
P300a generally occurs within 250-280ms, tends to have a fronto-central maxima, and is associated with novel stimulus detection (i.e., infrequent perceptual stimuli in oddball paradigms), which may be modulated by attentional demand
P300b tends to peak around 250-500+ms with a parietal maxima, and is associated with aspects of executive functioning, such as updating of working memory, subsequent memory storage, inhibitory control, and selective attentional processes
P300 has been the frequent target of ERP studies, including in the limited literature on MCI and AD.
The majority of the studies assessing the P300 component in this review did not specify P300a vs. P300b.
Thus, results and interpretation could not be divided by subcomponent.
executive functioning tasks (e.g., N-back, Go/No-go).
In contrast, 72% of the studies that reported no group differences used oddball tasks, and two of the studies that did report differences using oddball paradigms had particularly large sample sizes
The remaining two studies demonstrated larger P300 amplitudes in the MCI group [i.e., 7%; 82,120], but both studies were unique in that they compared P300 condition/stimulus difference waves instead of un-subtracted waveforms.
These two studies specifically highlight abnormally enhanced P300 amplitudes to less relevant stimuli (e.g., non-match vs. match) in MCI, in contrast to HC who appropriately devoted more resources to processing novel and relevant stimuli

MCI
These two studies were therefore consistent with the other studies reporting MCI differences.
Thus, at least when more complex tasks were employed with reasonable statistical power, P300 amplitude discriminated between groups, reflecting underlying neural deficits in MCI. .
Bennys and colleagues
Thus, P300 latency was more sensitive to neural differences in MCI than N200, even though most studies showing such differences used simple tasks (75% oddball tasks).
However, it was notable that sample sizes in these studies were amongst the largest (e.g., 34 participants per group), perhaps allowing for greater sensitivity, even with a simple task.
samples (e.g., ten per cell).

AD

AD

N400
The N400 is a negative-going wave that peaks approximately 300-600ms after stimulus onset and is associated with the evaluation of meaningfulness, including semantic and language processing, and recognition memory
This component can be elicited with various task paradigms.
For example, N400 amplitude has an inverse relationship with semantic priming, in which novel stimuli tend to elicit larger amplitudes than primed stimuli [i.e., priming effect; using a word recognition task with infrequent animal targets and had small sample sizes
Although there is some inconsistency in this small literature, particularly with different tasks and methods of calculating N400 metrics, N400 amplitude nevertheless appears to differentiate between AD and HC more consistently (76%) than N200 (18%) and P300 (60%) amplitudes.

Cognitively Intact APOE ɛ4
Carriers.
Only one study with healthy, cognitively intact APOE groups examined the N400 component
Carriers of the APOE ɛ4 allele had greater N400 amplitude than non-carriers in the right hemisphere during an odor-image congruency task, which is typically a left-hemisphere dominant task.
Midline N400 amplitudes, on the other hand, highlighted smaller amplitudes in the ɛ4+ compared to ɛ4-group.
Consistent with MCI and AD studies, N400 amplitude discriminated between APOE groups more effectively than earlier (i.e., N200, P300) components.
The late positive component (LPC) is a positive-going wave that typically peaks around 500-800ms post-stimulus.
The LPC is thought to reflect memory encoding and retrieval, especially for explicit recognition memory, and is often calculated as the difference between old and new trials (i.e., old/new effect).
LPC also indexes semantic and syntactic processing, and may be investigated in a repetition paradigm similar to the N400 component
The parietal effect (also ~500-800ms) is a recognition memory old/new effect (new>old) that is specifically largest over parietal electrodes
Relatedly, the late positive potential (LPP) falls under these same parameters (e.g., new>old ~400-800ms) but is particularly evident during emotive tasks

MCI

MCI Comparisons.
Two of the three studies that investigated LPC amplitude reported smaller amplitudes in the MCI compared to HC groups [i.e., 67%; 16,100].
Both of these studies used repetition tasks, one an emotive image repetition with a working memory component
The remaining study also reported smaller amplitudes in MCI compared to HC in the right hemisphere, but larger amplitudes in the left hemisphere during an olfactory oddball paradigm [i.e., 33%; 67].
This greater left hemisphere LPC magnitude was interpreted as a compensatory mechanism associated with deficits in earlier, sensory-level processing.
The only study that assessed LPC latency did not find significant between-group differences
There were no studies specific to the parietal effect or late positive potential with AD groups or any of these components in cognitively intact elders stratified by APOE ɛ4.

Slow Waves
Slow wave ERPs follow the P300 component and are characterized by their slow onset, resembling plateaus rather than peaks.
The specific role of slow wave potentials is still debated, but they are thought to generally reflect ongoing higher-order processing of stimuli
No studies have been reported examining AD or ɛ4 compared with controls, but four studies exist in MCI, which examined positive-and negative-slow waves during Go/No-go, auditory oddball, and task switching.
Both studies that assessed slow wave amplitude reported larger amplitude in MCI compared to HC groups, including greater amplitude in single domain MCI compared to both multiple domain MCI and controls
Furthermore, both studies of slow wave latency highlighted prolonged latency in MCI compared to HC

Discussion
Overall, the literature examining cognitive ERPs in MCI, AD, or risk for AD (APOE ɛ4) relative to HC is quite small.
The 100 studies meeting criteria for this review predominantly Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 27 covered N200, P300 and N400, but they did so with mostly small samples and a wide range of approaches and sample characteristics.
Yet, there is some consistency in findings across studies that lends confidence in the importance of cognitive ERPs toward assessment and early predictions of cognitive decline, as well as in directing future research.
Here we endeavor to highlight those consistencies and directions.

N200
Given the frequency of oddball paradigms in the reviewed studies, the N200 component as we have covered it herein tends to index conscious, intentional attention to stimuli, especially to deviations from an expected stimulus
Since attentional deficits are often evident in early stages of AD and may contribute to decline in other higher order cognitive processes, such as memory and planning
Despite this possibility, the majority of N200 amplitude studies detected no significant group differences (ɛ4: 100%; MCI: 67%; AD: 82%; see Table
However, conclusions from these studies are limited by an almost universal use of small, unbalanced samples (e.g., cells often ≤ 10) and simple, even passive, oddball paradigms.
Indeed, during lesser-used higher-order cognitive tasks, such as executive attention or inhibitory control, or visual modality rather than auditory, N200 amplitude was significantly reduced in MCI and AD relative to HC. N200 in the context of executive functioning tasks may reflect conflict monitoring and pre-motoric alerting of the need to activate inhibitory control processes
More research is needed to better understand the underlying processes associated with the N200 component with higher-order cognitive processes and to assess the discriminative ability of N200 in this context.

Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD

28
N200 latency discriminated between groups in approximately half of the studies (ɛ4: 100%; MCI: 47%; AD: 50%; see Table
Indeed, even in cognitively intact elders at risk for AD by carrying the APOE ɛ4 allele, prolonged N200 latency was apparent in all four studies regardless of task type and small samples.
Moreover, follow-up testing in one of these studies demonstrated that N200 latency predicted verbal learning decline 3.5 years later
Future investigation of the N200 component, particularly with visual or complex executive and attentional tasks, is important toward confirming whether the N200 is a robust index of early neural changes associated with pathological aging.

P300
The P300 component, which is associated with detection of novel stimuli, updating of working memory, inhibitory control, and selective attentional processes
As such, P300 has been the most studied ERP component in this context.
We note that despite different sources and cognitive processes associated with P300a vs. P300b, we were precluded from interpreting these distinctions because few of the studies specified P300 subcomponents.
Thus, distinguishing these subcomponents is an important future direction.
Our review highlighted a diagnostic severity-indexed trend across studies of reduced P300 amplitude (ɛ4: 0%; MCI: 38%; AD: 60%; see Table
P300 amplitude differences were best highlighted by executive function tasks, while P300 latency uniquely differentiated groups even during oddball paradigms when using larger samples.
Thus, P300 latency was more robust to these group Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 29 differences than N200 latency in oddball tasks.
Indeed, one P300 auditory oddball study further distinguished groups by severity of AD showing P300 amplitude was reduced late, in the moderate AD stage, while P300 latency was progressively delayed coincident with level of cognitive impairment, and evident earlier in the disease course than amplitude differences
Although the literature in cognitively intact elders carrying APOE ɛ4 is very small with P300 (five studies), an olfactory identification task showed prolonged P300 latency in ɛ4+ that oddball tasks did not reveal.
Olfactory tasks may be robust to group differences at various stages, though this modality requires specially built olfactometers and careful control over the sensory environment, which may limit their broad use.
Despite the relatively consistent pattern of reduced P300 amplitude and delayed P300 latency in well-powered AD studies, this pattern nevertheless was representative of only about 60-65% of the available studies.
As such, conclusions about the sensitivity of P300 to early AD pathology should be made with caution.
Notably, one study using a Stroop color-word interference task found delayed P300 latency in a middle-aged MCI group compared to middleaged HC, with 0.9 sensitivity and specificity to distinguish the groups, suggesting that complex attention or executive tasks may be best able to characterize neural changes evident early in the course of neuropathology
Thus, future research, particularly with complex attention and executive tasks assessing group differences in P300 amplitude, will be key to determining the value of P300 to early stage disease differences (e.g., APOE ɛ4 AD risk, MCI).

N400
The N400 component is associated with the evaluation of meaningfulness, including semantic and language processing, and recognition memory
Deficits in multiple domains
Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 30 of semantic and language processing are core features of AD progression
Indeed, although episodic memory deficit is a hallmark of AD, semantic memory impairment is estimated to affect at least 50-82% of those with AD
While less commonly investigated, there is also evidence of semantic deficits in MCI
Thus, the N400 may be an important candidate for indexing early neural changes associated with AD.
Consistent with this contention, N400 amplitude most consistently differentiated MCI (67%) and AD (76%) from HC groups across the components we reviewed (see Table
Amplitudes were generally smaller in MCI and AD compared to HC using raw waveforms, priming, congruity, and repetition effects, accompanied by evidence of reduced or absent priming and repetition effects in MCI and AD.
These consistent patterns across various approaches highlight the disruption of semantic networks evident with AD pathology.
Furthermore, MCI studies particularly highlighted the importance of the frontal N400 [i.e., FN400, early frontal effect; 144], which is thought to index familiarity and arguably identical in source to the traditional N400 [but also
Importantly, during recognition memory paradigms, it both distinguished MCI from HC group and correlated with episodic memory performance and medial temporal lobe gray matter volume
Despite these promising findings, research with the N400 is lacking, particularly in MCI, compared with other components; only 6 MCI studies exist (see Tables
Even less well studied is N400 latency, despite the generally strong indication that it is prolonged in AD (67%; see Table
Moreover, only one study analyzed N400 amplitude with cognitively intact APOE ɛ4 carriers, revealing right hemisphere recruitment during a left hemisphere task, thereby suggesting a compensatory function
This was the only available study of AD risk Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 31 groups that examined a later cognitive ERP component or used a more complex cognitive task.
Indeed, it was also the only study to reveal significant differences in ERP amplitude between cognitively intact AD risk groups, despite having only ten participants per group.
Thus, the N400 component demonstrates promise for distinguishing between healthy and pathological aging.
Future N400 research using complex cognitive tasks with MCI, AD, and healthy AD risk groups is critical to improve understanding of early changes that presage cognitive decline.

Other late components and non-traditional approaches
While little investigated, other later components reflective of recognition memory show promise for discriminating MCI (LPC, PE, and LPP) and AD (LPC) from healthy control groups, generally showing reduced amplitude in MCI and AD (see Table
No studies have yet investigated latency for these components between these groups.
Similarly, slow waves, which may reflect cognitive processes such as memory or emotion processing depending on the context, have been little studied in MCI and AD, but the two existing studies showed smaller amplitude and delayed latency in MCI relative to HC across both low-level and complex tasks (see Table
Future research on these components is particularly important given promising results in so few studies that varied greatly in task and study characteristics.
As noted based on components that have received more study than these, additional studies using complex tasks might be particularly effective at discriminating between groups, perhaps especially at an early stage preceding measurable cognitive impairment.

Conclusions and Future Directions
The existing literature in MCI, AD, and APOE ɛ4 risk for AD suggests more research is warranted investigating cognitive ERPs as potential biomarkers of AD-related neuropathology.

The studies reviewed highlight overall patterns of reduced amplitude and delayed latency in pathological aging (MCI, AD) compared to healthy controls, particularly in advanced disease progression and when examining later ERP components with relatively complex cognitive tasks.
Such patterns are particularly evident in AD, where reduced P300 and N400 amplitude and prolonged N200, P300, and N400 latency were common findings.
Similar but less robust patterns were evident in MCI.
Strikingly, only six studies examining cognitively intact participants with risk for AD met inclusion criteria for this review, four of which used olfactory ERPs.
They typically showed prolonged ERP latencies in ɛ4 carriers relative to non-carriers, while only one differentiated ERP amplitude by AD risk; using a late component (N400) and a complex task with relevant lateral electrodes, increased right hemisphere amplitude suggested compensatory activation in ɛ4 carriers
This finding was consistent with recent fMRI research showing initially greater neural activation in cognitively intact older adults who carry the APOE ɛ4 allele
Our review also highlighted the gaps in this scant literature, including the small number of existing studies, small samples, vastly varying paradigms and analytical methods, lack of subcomponent differentiation and lateral electrode analysis, and variability in age and cognitive functioning in comparison groups.
Indeed, such differences, and an overall paucity of reporting of key contrast data or effect sizes substantively deter meaningful and reproducible metaanalyses within and across components.
Yet, these limitations did not preclude the ability to see overall patterns hinting at promise for ERPs as a feasible approach to an early index of AD.
Future studies that specifically examine later cognitive ERP components in AD, MCI and cognitively intact AD-risk with larger, comparable groups and preferably complex cognitive tasks are urgently needed to evaluate that promise.
Future research must also aim to establish the sensitivity and specificity of ERPs in differentiating between groups.
This would allow determination of whether ERPs could be useful in combination with neuropsychological testing toward identification, prediction, and tracking of neural changes prior to and coinciding with cognitive decline, thereby assisting with targeting for intervention.

p<.001,  " # = .25).
MCI studies had significantly larger samples (ps <.001; MMCI = 25.9,
SD = 14.5, MED = 22.5, range = 5-91; MHC = 23.2,
SD = 11.0,

SD = 7.1, MED = 14, range = 6-36; MHC = 15.6,
SD = 6.7,
MED = 15, range = 8-39) and ε4 studies (Mε4+ = 12, SD = 5.1, MED = 10, range = 9-21; Mε4-=11.6,
SD = 4.8, MED = 10, range 8-20), which did not significantly differ.
Some MCI studies subdivided their samples by MCI type, resulting in group sizes generally more comparable to those in AD studies.

These search terms turned out a combined 379 initial articles (153 PsycINFO; 226 PubMed).
Notably, Running head: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF COGNITIVE ERPS IN MCI AND AD 8 there were far fewer initial returns for APOE/Apolipoprotein-E searches (20) compared to Alzheimer's or MCI (359 and 211, respectively).

This review covers a total of 3,922 participants (2,359 MCI v. HC; 1,445 AD v. HC; 118 APOE ε4+/-).
Within each study type (MCI, AD, or ε4), sample size was not significantly different between the comparison groups (MCI v. HC: t(47) = 1.5, p=.15; AD v. HC: t(44) = -0.7,
p=.52; ε4+ v.

Specifically, healthy controls tended to be younger than the diagnostic group in both studies of MCI (t(32) = 5.4, p<.001; MMCI = 71.3,

28,29,51,78,81,83,86,106,120,142]ng N200 latency reported no significant between-group differences [i.e., 53%;28,29,51,78,81,83,86,106,120,142].Of those that did detect significant differences, all nine reported prolonged latencies in MCI compared to healthy control groups [i.e., 47%; 11,12,22,30,53,90,94,107,145].
Missonier and colleagues further specified that N200 latencies were prolonged in progressive MCI compared to both non-


Amplitude.
Sixteen of the 29 total studies assessing P300 amplitude in MCI


and simple tasks was common to all of them.
Based on findings with MCI and AD, they may not have had the sensitivity to detect subtle differences.


[144]0]f six studies that assessed N400 amplitude in MCI groups reported smaller amplitudes in MCI compared to healthy controls [i.e., 50%; 1,48,64].Two of these studies used recognition memory paradigms [i.e., old/new effects; 1,64], while the third demonstrated a lack of visual object priming in MCI[48].All three of these studies specifically assessed N400 amplitude at frontal electrodes (i.e., frontal N400, FN400), which has been suggested to index familiarity and conceptual implicit memory[32,80], with others suggesting no functional distinction between N400 components with frontal vs. centro-parietal peaks[144].
A fourth study revealed larger N400 amplitudes in MCI vs. HC groups during a priming task.
As amplitude should decrease to primed stimuli, this study indicated semantic priming deficits in the MCI group [i.e., 17%; 137], consistent with the other studies showing deficits in MCI vs. HC.
The two final studies reported no significant group differences in N400 amplitude [i.e., 33%; 100,154] using word repetition and face recognition tasks.
Thus, although few studies are yet available, N400 amplitude successfully differentiated between MCI and HC in 67% of studies.
