Hybrid Quinoline-Thiosemicarbazone Therapeutics as a New Treatment Opportunity for Alzheimer’s Disease‒Synthesis, In Vitro Cholinesterase Inhibitory Potential and Computational Modeling Analysis
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide.
The limited pharmacological approaches based on cholinesterase inhibitors only provide symptomatic relief to AD patients.
Moreover, the adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, muscle cramps, and headaches associated with these drugs and numerous clinical trial failures present substantial limitations on the use of medications and call for a detailed insight of disease heterogeneity and development of preventive and multifactorial therapeutic strategies on urgent basis.
In this context, we herein report a series of quinoline-thiosemicarbazone hybrid therapeutics as selective and potent inhibitors of cholinesterases.
A facile multistep synthetic approach was utilized to generate target structures bearing multiple sites for chemical modifications and establishing drug-receptor interactions.
The structures of all the synthesized compounds were fully established using readily available spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, 1 H-and 13 C-NMR).
In vitro inhibitory results revealed compound 5b as a promising and lead inhibitor with an IC 50 value of 0.12 ± 0.02 µM, a 5-fold higher potency than standard drug (galantamine; IC 50 = 0.62 ± 0.01 µM).
The synergistic effect of electron-rich (methoxy) group and ethylmorpholine moiety in quinolinethiosemicarbazone conjugates contributes significantly in improving the inhibition level.
Molecular docking analysis revealed various vital interactions of potent compounds with amino acid residues and reinforced the in vitro results.
Kinetics experiments revealed the competitive mode of inhibition while ADME properties favored the translation of identified inhibitors into safe and promising drug candidates for pre-clinical testing.
Collectively, inhibitory activity data and results from key physicochemical properties merit further research to ensure the design and development of safe and high-quality drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of senile dementia.
The typical symptoms include the memory dysfunction, cognitive impairment, psychiatric and behavioral abnormality, and difficulty in performing everyday tasks
This multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder is one of the leading causes of death in elderly people and continues to be a social, health and economic burden on society.
The exact molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of AD is not well-understood yet; however, several hypotheses have been proposed explaining the initiation of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
These include cholinergic hypothesis (pathological changes and the dysfunction of the neuro-cholinergic system), amyloid hypothesis (β-amyloid tangles and aggregations inducing neural apoptosis, tau protein hyperphosphorylation forming senile plaque), oxidative stress hypothesis (neuro-inflammation and increasing level of reactive oxygen radicals), and bio-metal hypothesis (deregulation of transition bio-metals in AD patients).
Among these, the design and development of new and potent inhibitors based on central cholinergic hypothesis remains the most common and clinically tested strategy for AD therapy
Cholinesterase (ChE), namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7)
and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE, EC 3.1.1.8),
catalyze the hydrolysis of cholinergic neurotransmitters.
Acetylcholine (ACh) is predominantly decomposed by AChE compared to BuChE, thus the inhibition of AChE to increase the level of ACh remains a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
The crystal structure of this enzyme reveals the presence of a catalytic active site (CAS) and a peripheral anionic site (PAS) linked through a 20 Å long gorge.
Furthermore, the role of AChE in the induction of AD through the proaggregation activity of the Aβ protein, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium dysregulation, and neuronal dysfunction has been observed.
Therefore, bioactive molecules with a potential to interact specifically with both catalytic site (PAS or CAS) residues can significantly help in the inhibition of AChE while eliminating Aβ aggregation
The current treatment strategy provides only a symptomatic relief to AD patients.
The previously approved (marketed) drugs, including tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, despite being diverse in structural features and pharmacokinetic profiles, are proving ineffective as medications in stopping or reversing the progression of AD
Although, after 20 years, the approval of Aducanumab, treating the possible cause of the neurodegenerative disorder, rather than just the symptoms, provides a hope against this intractable condition
Therefore, employing a wellknown pharmacophore hybridization strategy could prove effective in exerting a beneficial role in the treatment of AD
Quinoline (1-aza-naphthalene or benzo[b]pyridine) represents a class of nitrogencontaining heterocycles, which are well recognized for a diverse variety of pharmacological applications
Various natural products, bioactive drug molecules, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals incorporate quinoline pharmacophore
Notable medicinal applications associated with the quinoline heterocycle include anticancer, anti-tubercular, antiproliferative, anti-malarial, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-protozoal, anti-fungal, anti-tumor, antioxidant, anti-HIV, anti-hypertensive, alkaline phosphatase inhibition and for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders
In parallel, thiosemicarbazones also display a wide plethora of biological properties ranging from anticancer, anti-bacterial, anti-tumor, anti-protozoal, anti-fungal, anti-leishmanial, and antiviral activities
Thiosemicarbazone derivatives have also been employed as NDRG1 up-regulators, cathepsin inhibitors, and cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease

Spectroscopic Characterization
The condensation reaction of formylquinolines 3a-f with thiosemicarbazides 4a or 4b affording quinoline-thiosemicarbazones 5a-k was confirmed through 1 H NMR spectroscopy where the target products feature a distinct singlet for azomethine (N=CH) proton
Two additional signals attributable to secondary thioamide protons, out of which =N-NH proton resonated at a relatively more downfield chemical shift as a singlet peak at 11.76-12.23
ppm compared to C-NH proton (10.15-10.29 ppm) also confirmed the structures of thiosemicarbazones 5f-k.
However, in case of compounds 5a-e, C-NH proton displayed a comparatively upfield triplet signal (8.54-8.70 ppm) due to coupling with the adjacent methylene protons.
Moreover, the disappearance of a very distinct aldehyde peak around 10 ppm also confirmed the consumption of 3a-f during the course of reaction for the formation of target compounds 5a-k.
The aromatic protons showed chemical shifts between 6.80 and 9.40 ppm according to their chemical environment, with H-4 of quinoline heterocycle appearing as the most deshielded proton.
Moreover, in 1 H NMR spectra of thiosemicarbazones 5a-e, the morpholine ring protons gave two sets of signals around 2.45 and 3.60 ppm in addition to linear chain methylene protons that also exhibit a similar pattern.
The structures 5a-e were further confirmed from 13 C NMR data.
The C=S carbon resonated at the highest chemical shift near 177 ppm.
The signals, referring to aromatic and azomethine carbon atoms, appeared between 106 and 163 ppm.
In case of compounds 5a-e, signals for morpholine ring carbon atoms appeared around 57.0 and 66.0 ppm.
The ethyl chain between the morpholine and thioamide group showed peaks near 40.8 and 53.5 ppm, however the former carbon signals were overlapped by NMR solvent signal (DMSO-d 6 ).
Overall, proton integration and appropriate number of carbon signals in 1 H and 13 C NMR showed complete agreement with the corresponding structures.
Furthermore, the elemental analyses of all the quinoline-thiosemicarbazones were in accordance with the proposed structures.

The results of inhibitory assays for target compounds are presented in Table
The designed molecules consist of two basic components: (i) the quinoline heterocycle with varied degree of structural features (R 1 & R 2 ), which is mainly involved in π-π stacking and π-alkyl interactions, and (ii) an acyclic thiosemicarbazone fragment bearing a suitable terminal attachment (R 3 ) in the form of an aromatic ring (phenyl) and a saturated heterocyclic ring (morpholine) linked through an aliphatic linker (Figure
Various nitrogen atoms can act as hydrogen bond donor sites for establishing vital interactions with the amino acid residues in the active site of enzymes.
Hence, the hybridization concept not only delivered new and diversified lead structures but also maintained significantly pharmacokinetically relevant parameters, such as molar mass.
As such, various dynamic structure-activity relationship analyses could be manifested depicting the effect of functional group/substituent variation on the biological potential.

The evaluation of activity results presented in Table
In general, all the tested hybrid derivatives were completely selective towards AChE and showed inhibition in the range of 0.12-60.9
μM.
The presence of ethylmorpholine as R 3 on the thioamide unit was significantly preferred over phenyl ring and the derivatives bearing this moiety were identified as the lead candidates.
Compound 5b showed the highest inhibitory efficacy with an IC50 value of 0.12 ± 0.02 μM, 5-fold more potent than the standard drug (galantamine; IC50 = 0.62 ± 0.01 μM).
For further exploration of structure-activity relationships, various alterations were considered taking into account the substituents pattern on The evaluation of activity results presented in Table

For further exploration of structure-activity relationships, various alterations were considered taking into account the substituents pattern on different sites of the hybrid structure (Figure
For instance, switching the position of methoxy group from 6-position (R 1 ) to 7-position (R 2 ) on quinoline ring led to reduced potency (5c; IC 50 = 5.53 ± 0.11 µM), however, the effect of replacing ethylmorpholine with a phenyl ring was completely detrimental (5i; IC 50 = 60.9 ± 6.57 µM).
Replacement of methoxy group in 5c with a methyl substituent reinstated the activity and compound 5d showed slightly better inhibition profile than galantamine with an IC 50 value of 0.55 ± 0.01 µM.
Similar trend was observed for compound 5j.
Disappointingly, the introduction of a halogen substituent (Cl) as R 2 produced deleterious effect in both cases (5e & 5k); however, the compound bearing an ethylmorpholine (5e) was less affected compared to its congener (5k), which showed a sharp decrease in potency (IC 50 = 47.1 ± 1.45 µM).
Further modifications to compound 5b, the lead molecule, were made while removing all the substituents at quinoline ring and the results unveiled the importance of methoxy substituent at 6-position for better in vitro inhibitory properties.
The resulting compound 5a showed significant activity (IC 50 = 2.95 ± 0.24 µM), but less than lead inhibitor and standard drug (Figure
Collectively, the presence of both R 1 and R 2 substituents in combination with ethylmorpholine in an interactive manner is necessary for the quinoline-thiosemicarbazone hybrids to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase with maximum efficiency.

Molecular Docking Studies

Molecular docking analysis of all the tested compounds was performed against AChE to explore the The synthesized hybrids 5a-k have also been investigated for their potential to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase enzyme, however, the compounds showed exclusive selectivity towards acetylcholinesterase. Against butyrylcholinesterase, all the compounds showed <50% inhibition; however, in contrast to AChE results, the modest enhancement in potency preferred the presence of an aromatic (phenyl) ring instead of ethylmorpholine and a methoxy substituent appeared to be crucial for activity.
The lead example was compound 5g with an IC 50 value of 11.3 ± 0.67 µM while other derivatives 5h-k showed inhibition of BChE in the range of 16-32%.
Hence, the results obtained for BChE confirmed the importance of aromatic moiety on the thioamide core, albeit low activity.

Mechanism of Inhibition
With the help of kinetics studies, the mode of action of the most potent compounds 5b and 5d was determined using acetylthiocholine iodide as a substrate.
Enzyme kinetics were used to determine the mechanism of acetylcholinesterase inhibition.
Lineweaver-Burk graph (reciprocal of rate of reaction 1/S and reciprocal of substrate concentration 1/V) were used for the determination of the type of inhibition and analysis of effect of inhibitor on V max and K m .
The slope K m /V max of each line in the Lineweaver-Burk plot was plotted against different concentrations of substrate and chemicals to determine the value of K i .
Kinetics studies were performed on 5b and 5d with different concentrations of compounds and substrate.
Four concentrations of 1 mM compound 5b (0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18 µM), compound 5d (0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 µM) and four concentrations of substrate (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mM showing 1/S as 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.667 and 0.5, respectively) were made.
Both compounds competes with substrate (acetylthiocholine iodide) for binding in the active site of acetylcholinesterase. V max of enzyme was not affected and K m of acetylcholinesterase was increased which showed competitive inhibition as shown in   The most potent compound 5b presented multiple important interactions with amino acids of active pocket like π-π T-shaped (6.23 Å ) by quinoline ring and π-sulfur (4.34 Å ) by sulfur atom in the thiosemicarbazone moiety with Trp86, the most important amino acid residue within the active pocket of AChE.
Hydrogen bonding was noticed between oxygen atom and Gly122 (2.82 Å ).
However, Trp439 (4.68 Å ) and Tyr449 (5.86 Å ) exhibited π-sulfur interactions with sulfur atom in the thiosemicarbazone moiety of 5b.
Methoxy oxygen showed hydrogen bond with Gly122 (2.82 Å ), while chloro atom formed π-lone pair (2.80 Å ) with Tyr337.
Moreover, nitrogen atom of morpholine ring exhibited attractive charge interactions (4.93 Å ) with Glu452 (Figure
It was clearly noted that methoxy group did not occupied the deep cleft of catalytic site.

Molecular docking analysis of all the tested compounds was performed against AChE to explore the possible binding modes.
An overview of the active site of AChE containing cognate ligand and all the inhibitors was presented in Figure
The orientation of the most potent and selective compounds 5b and 5d along with the crystallographic inhibitor huprine W were presented in the active site of AChE (Figure
The active pocket of AChE was surrounded by amino acid residues Leu76, Tyr124, Phe338, Gly122, Trp286, Tyr337, Val 340, Phe297, Leu289, Tyr72, Ser298, Ser125, Arg 296, Ser203, Tyr341, Ala204 and His447.
The hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions were noticed by the most potent inhibitor 5b as well as by huprine W as reported previously
The cognate ligand (huprine W) showed two conventional hydrogen bonds with Ser203 (2.33 Å) and Gly122 (2.96 Å) and multiple π-π stacking interactions (4.00, 5.30 The type of interactions between ligands (5b and 5d) and receptor (4BDT) along with the distance and atoms involved in the interactions are presented in 2D interactions in Figure
The docking studies revealed that the most potent compound 5b, having 6-methoxy at quinoline ring was responsible for the conformational changes and the best binding of compound within the active pocket of enzyme.
In vitro results of all the compounds showing variable inhibition against acetylcholinesterase were justified from their binding interactions within the catalytic region of the enzyme.
Moreover, the selected compounds presented negative free energy values and were found to bind with significant affinity.
Taken together, results presented herein showed that quinoline morpholinoethyl hydrazine carbothioamide derivatives are promising inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.    Additionally, the nitrogen atom of morpholine ring was involved in the formation of the salt bridge (2.69 Å) andπ-cation (4.78 Å), and interactions with Glu452 and Tyr449, respectively.
Moreover, multiple π-alkyl (5.14, 5.37 and 3.76 Å) interactions were formed by methyl group with Tyr337, Tyr124 and Tyr341, respectively.
The chloro group at the quinoline ring showed π-alkyl interactions (5.43 and 3.32 Å) with Trp439 and Tyr337, respectively, as shown in Figure
Both compounds exhibited mostly similar interactions with the same residues, except for the presence of 6-methoxy and 7-methyl at the quinoline ring.
These multiple interactions, especially π-π and strong hydrogen bonds by the potent compounds deep inside the catalytic cleft of acetylcholinesterase, can be the possible reason for their significant inhibitory profile.
The binding poses of all the derivatives were shown in Figure
However, other residues do not show binding at the same position, instead showed binding with other amino acids and are slightly away from the active pocket

The potent inhibitors bind to the receptor with a very high binding affinity compared to the cognate ligands of the enzyme.
Moreover, moderately and less active compounds exhibited low binding affinity as compared to potent compounds.

In Vitro Cholinesterase Inhibition Assay
Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase was measured in vitro by spectrophotometric method developed by Ellman
Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 60 µL phosphate buffers (KH 2 PO 4 /KOH), pH 7.7, 10 µL of test compound dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration was 2%) and 10 µL of enzyme (0.5 and 3.4 U/mg of AChE or BChE, respectively).
Reaction contents were mixed thoroughly and kept for 10 min during pre-incubation at 37 • C.
After the pre-incubation, 10 µL of 1 mM acetythiocholine chloride or butyrylthiocholine chloride was added to the respective AChE or BChE enzyme solution to start the enzymatic reactions.
DTNB (10 µL, 0.5 mM) was also added as a coloring reagent.
The reaction mixture was again incubated for 20 min at 37 • C and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using 96-well micro-plate reader.
All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Galantamine (0.1 mM) was used as a standard inhibitor.
In order to measure the activity of enzyme, assay was performed with a blank containing all of the components except inhibitor.
The percent inhibition was calculated by the following formula:
Where "A c " and "A f " are absorbance obtained for the respective enzyme (AChE and BChE) in the presence or absence of inhibitors, after subtracting the respective background (pre-read absorbance).
Compounds exhibiting > 50% inhibition against ChEs were further evaluated for the determination of IC 50 values which were calculated by non-linear curve fitting program 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).

Kinetics Studies
Michaelis-Menten kinetics experiments were used to determine the type of enzyme inhibition.
Detailed kinetics studies of the potent compounds 5b and 5d were performed to probe the potential mechanism of action to inhibit the enzyme.
For this purpose, the initial rates of the enzyme inhibition at four concentrations of substrate (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mM) in the absence and presence of four different concentrations of compound 5b (0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18 µM) and compound 5d (0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 µM) against acetylcholinesterase were measured.

Molecular Docking Protocols

Structure Selection and Preparation
Molecular docking studies were conducted to investigate the putative interactions of the compounds making complex with the acetylcholinesterase enzyme.
In order to perform docking studies, the crystallographic structure of human AChE (PDB ID: 4BDT) was obtained from the RCSB PDB database
Prior to the experiments, the structures of the enzyme and compounds were prepared as follows.
The enzyme structure was protonated with the Protonate3D
The structure was energy minimized using Amber99 force field including all crystallographic solvent molecules.
The backbone atoms were restrained with a small force in order to avoid collapse of the binding pockets during energy minimization calculations.
Subsequently, the co-crystallized ligands and solvent molecules were removed.
The crystallographic water molecules were removed and hypothetical hydrogen atoms were added to the X-ray structure in standard geometries with the MOE.

Compounds Preparation
The 3D structural coordinates of compounds were generated using MOE followed by assignment of protonation and ionization states in physiological pH range by using the "wash" module.
Afterwards, the structures of compounds were energy minimized with the MMFF94x force field for docking studies.

Docking Studies
For docking studies, calculations were performed using LeadIT from BioSolveIT, GmbH Germany
Receptor was loaded by Load or Prepare Receptor utility of the LeadIT software.
The binding site for the receptor was defined in 9.0 Å spacing of the amino acid residues.
By FlexX utility of LeadIT, docking of compounds was performed.
For this purpose, compounds were docked inside the active site of receptor and 50 conformations for each ligand-receptor complex were produced based on binding free energies.
Default docking parameters were not modified and top 30 highest scoring docked positions were kept for further analysis
Poses with lowest free binding energy values were considered as the most stable ones having the highest affinity to interact with the receptor.
Each ligandprotein complex having lowest binding free energy for interactions was examined and 3D putative binding modes were visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer v4

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
The crystallographic structure of human AChE (PDB ID: 4BDT)
accessed on 14 September 2021).
Protein manipulation and protonation were made with the help of GROMOS96 force field having the 43a1 parameter set.
The GROMACS (Groningen Machine for Chemical Simulation) simulation packages, 5.1.4
were used for the MD simulations and protocol for molecular dynamics simulations was used according to previously developed methods
Parameterization of compound 5b and Huprine W were done using the PRODRG servers
MOE and VMD
The crystallographic structure was solvated (addition of water molecule) and counter ions were incorporated to neutralize the receptor.
Subsequently, the energy minimization of the system was done, followed by equilibration using two sequential NVT (100 ps) and NPT (100 ps) runs during which protein's atoms were restrained.
After minimization, the resulting ensembles were submitted to 30 ns MD simulations with a time-step of 2 fs for each simulation.
Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were applied during all the simulations.
Steepest descent method was used for simple energy minimizations.
All NVT and NPT runs used the Berendsen thermostat and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat for temperature (approx.
303 K) and pressure coupling (approx.
1.01 bar), respectively.
The cut-off radius of 10 Å and smooth Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) protocol were observed for long-range method.
The root mean square deviations, fluctuations and radius of gyration were plotted using XMGRACE v5.1.19

Conclusions
In summary, a series of new quinoline-thiosemicarbazone hybrids was designed and synthesized using a facile multistep protocol.
Several commercially available anilines were successfully employed to construct quinoline heterocycle via Vilsmeyer-Haack formylation reaction.
Hybridization of quinoline carbaldehydes with thiosemicarbazides afforded target compounds in excellent yields, devoiding the need of column chromatographic purification.
Evaluation of cholinesterase inhibitory potential revealed the discovery of numerous potent and highly efficacious inhibitors.
In particular, compound 5b inhibited the acetylcholinesterase selectively showing an IC 50 value of 0.12 ± 0.02 µM, a 5-fold high potency than galantamine (standard).
Structure-activity relationship analysis showed the importance of electron-rich (methoxy) substituent at quinoline ring and ethylmorpholine on the carbothioamide unit, playing a vital role in obtaining high therapeutic efficacy.
Docking, physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water solubility, pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry properties were also calculated for the potent inhibitors suggesting the safer profile to be investigated as drug molecules and have high probability of blood-brain penetration and absorption.
Collectively, our findings established that compound 5b is a potent, selective and competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and can serve as a promising candidate for further preclinical development for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease.

π-π T-shaped interactions are shown as fuscia, hydrogen bond as green, π-sulfur as yellow and π-alkyl interaction as light green dashed lines.The most potent compound 5b presented multiple important interactions with amino acids of active pocket like π-π T-shaped (6.23 Å) by quinoline ring and π-sulfur (4.34 Å) by sulfur atom in the thiosemicarbazone moiety with Trp86, the most important amino acid residue within the active pocket of AChE.
Hydrogen bonding was noticed between oxygen atom and Gly122 (2.82 Å).
However, Trp439 (4.68 Å) and Tyr449 (5.86 Å) exhibited π-sulfur interactions with sulfur atom in the thiosemicarbazone moiety of 5b.
Methoxy oxygen showed hydrogen bond with Gly122 (2.82 Å), while chloro atom formed π-lone pair (2.80 Å) with Tyr337.
Moreover, nitrogen atom of morpholine ring exhibited attractive charge interactions (4.93 Å) with Glu452 (Figure5b).
It was clearly noted that methoxy group did not occupied the deep cleft of catalytic site.Another potent and selective compound 5d docked inside the AChE represented several important interactions.
These include π-π T-shaped (5.43 Å) by the methyl quinoline ring, hydrogen bond (3.30
Å), by the sulfur atom of thiosemicarbazone moiety and πcation interactions (5.26 Å), and by the nitrogen atom of morpholine ring with Trp86.
Additionally, the nitrogen atom of morpholine ring was involved in the formation of the salt bridge (2.69 Å) andπ-cation (4.78 Å), and interactions with Glu452 and Tyr449, respectively.
Moreover, multiple π-alkyl (5.14, 5.37 and 3.76 Å) interactions were formed by methyl group with Tyr337, Tyr124 and Tyr341, respectively.
The chloro group at the quinoline ring showed π-alkyl interactions (5.43 and 3.32 Å) with Trp439 and Tyr337, respectively, as shown in Figure5c.
Both compounds exhibited mostly similar interactions with the same residues, except for the presence of 6-methoxy and 7-methyl at the quinoline ring.
These multiple interactions, especially π-π and strong hydrogen bonds by the potent compounds deep inside the catalytic cleft of acetylcholinesterase, can be the possible reason for their significant inhibitory profile.The binding poses of all the derivatives were shown in FigureS3, which clearly represents the binding of compound 5b and 5d near cognate ligand showing interactions with important residues as Huprine W does.
However, other residues do not show binding at the same position, instead showed binding with other amino acids and are slightly away from the active pocketThe type of interactions between ligands (5b and 5d) and receptor (4BDT) along with the distance and atoms involved in the interactions are presented in 2D interactions in FigureS4and Table2.
