Long non-coding RNA ANRIL knockdown suppresses apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines while enhancing neurite outgrowth via binding microRNA-125a in a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease
The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the long non-coding rna antisense non-coding rna in the inK4 locus (lnc-anril) knockdown on apoptosis, neurite outgrowth and inflammation based on a PC12 cellular alzheimer's disease (ad) model.
a cellular ad model was constructed by treating nerve growth factor stimulated PC12 cells with amyloid β (aβ) 1-42 and then control knockdown plasmid and lnc-anril knockdown plasmid were transfected in the Pc12 cellular ad model as the Kd-negative control (nc) group or the ad-anril group respectively.
Apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, pro-inflammatory cytokines and microrna (mir)-125a were assessed.
rescue experiments were conducted by transfecting lnc-ANRIL knockdown plasmid and lnc-anril knockdown plasmid and mir-125a inhibitor in the PC12 cellular AD model as the KD-ANRIL group or Kd-anril + Kd-mir-125a group respectively.
Following transfection, cell apoptosis deccreased while neurite outgrowth increased in the Kd-anril group compared with the Kd-nc group (all P<0.01).
concerning inf lammation, tumor necrosis factor-α (TnF-α) and interleukin (il)-1β, il-6 and il-17 were decreased in the Kd-anril group compared with the Kd-nc group (all P<0.01).
miR-125a was negatively regulated by lnc-ANRIL and therefore rescue experiments were subsequently conducted.
in the rescue experiments, cell apoptosis was increased while total neurite outgrowth was inhibited in the Kd-anril + Kd-mir-125a group compared with the Kd-anril group (all P<0.01), and TnF-α, il-1β, il-6 and il-17 were increased in the Kd-anril + Kd-mir-125a group compared with the Kd-anril group (all P<0.01).
a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that lnc-ANRIL directly bound miR-125a.
lnc-ANRIL knockdown suppressed cell apoptosis and inflammation while promoting neurite outgrowth via binding of miR-125a in AD.

Introduction
alzheimer's disease (ad), a disease of the nervous system associated with neurodegeneration, is responsible for the majority of cases of dementia worldwide and presents with an increasing incidence, partly due to the aging of the population worldwide
Patients with ad always experience a decrease in quality of life resulting from the impairment of cognitive and physical function, which also brings rise to a heavy burden to their carers
Currently, the mainstay of AD treatment is the combination of daily life care from the carers or nurses of the patients and drug therapy, with the latter mainly including cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate antagonists
However, ad remains a disease that cannot yet be cured, even though accumulating factors have been found to be useful in AD management; therefore, further efforts are required to explore the underlying mechanisms of ad pathogenesis
long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) are a category of noncoding rnas (ncrnas) that have almost no protein coding function and a length of >200 nucleotides
an intriguing lncrna, lnc-antisense non-coding rna in the inK4 locus (lnc-ANRIL), has been identified in a number of diseases with a pathology related to inflammation and neurodysfunction, including diabetic retinopathy, coronary artery disease and spinal cord injury
These findings indicate that lnc-ANRIL may be a genetic factor participating in the regulation of inflammation and neurodysfunction; thus, it was hypothesized that lnc-anril may also mediate neurodegeneration and inflammation in AD.
However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study to date has been performed to investigate this.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of lnc-anril knockdown on apoptosis, neurite outgrowth and inflammation based on a PC12 cellular model of ad.

Materials and methods
Cell culture.
The rat pheochromocytoma cell line (Pc12 cell) was purchased from the china center for Type culture collection and cultured in 85% rPMi-1640 Medium (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated horse serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, inc.).
293T cells were purchased from Shanghai Hongshun Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and incubated in 90% DMEM Medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with 10% FBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.).
All cells were maintained in 95% air and 5% co 2 at 37˚C.
PC12 cellular AD model.
As described in a previous study
Subsequently, the oligomerized aβ1-42 (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), which was pre-incubated for 7 days at 37˚C to accelerate aggregation, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 1 mM; finally, 1 µM oligomerized Aβ1-42 peptide was added to nGF-stimulated Pc12 cells for 24 h for the construction of the cellular model of ad.
Following the aβ1-42 insult, the cell counting Kit-8 (ccK-8, dojindo Molecular Technologies, inc.) assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol to assess the cell viability for validation of the Pc12 cellular ad model.
in addition, reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was performed to assess lnc-anril expression.
The Pc12 cells without aβ1-42 insult served as the controls in the CCK-8 and RT-qPCR assays.

The sequence of lnc-ANRIL small hairpin (sh) rna was 5'-caccaaaTccaGaacccTcTGacaTTT GccGaaGcaaaTGTcaGaGGGTTcTGGa-3, the sequence of miR-125a inhibitor was 5'-UCACAGGUUAAA GGGUCUCAGGGA-3, the sequence of the negative control for lnc-anril shrna was 5'-caccGTTcT ccGaacGTGTcacGTcGaaacGTGacacGTTcGGaG AA-3' , and the sequence of the negative control for miR-125a inhibitor was 5'-UUGUACUACACAAAAGUACUG-3'.
After 24 h, lnc-anril and mir-125a expression in the groups was detected by RT-qPCR; at 48 h, the cell apoptotic rate and neurite outgrowth were assessed using Hoechst/propidium iodide (PI) staining (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Corporation; magnification, x200) in five randomly selected fields of view.
The apoptosis data were obtained by counting the PI-positive cells (apoptotic cells) and Hoechst 33342-positive cells (viable cells) in the visual field using Image Pro Plus (v6.0;
Media Cybernetics, Inc.), then calculating the cell apoptotic rate by dividing the total cells in the visual field by the number of positive cells.
additionally, the supernatant in each group was collected at 48 h, and the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TnF-α) and interleukin (il)-1β, il-6 and il-17 were measured using eliSa kits (cat.

In addition, the transcript of miR-125a that was evaluated in the present study was mir-125a-5p.
CCK-8 assay.
Cell viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay, which was conducted as follows: 10 µl CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) and 90 µl serum-free cell freezing medium rPMi-1640 medium were added to the plate.
The plate was then incubated for 2 h with 5% CO 2 in 37˚C, after which a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, inc.) was used to detect the optical density value at a wavelength of 450 nm to assess the cell viability.
Luciferase reporter assay.
Wild-type (WT) and mutant-type (Mut) lnc-anril luciferase reporter plasmids, mir-125a overexpression and control overexpression plasmids were constructed by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd.
Lipofectamine ® 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was applied to transfect the plasmids into 293T cells, and the transfected cells were then divided into the wild-type/negative control (WT/nc), wild-type/mir-125a overexpression (WT/ oe-mir-125a), mutant-type/negative control (Mut/nc) and mutant-type/mir-125a overexpression (Mut/oe-mir-125a) groups.
The dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega corp.) was applied to measure the luciferase activity following the manufacturer's protocol.
RT-qPCR.
The total rna was extracted from the cells (1x10 5 ) using Trizol ® reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and the concentration was evaluated by a spectrophotometer.
An iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) was used for the reverse transcription procedure, following which the quantification was performed using the Quantinova SYBr-Green Pcr kit (Qiagen GmbH).
The relative expression of lnc-ANRIL was assessed using GaPdH as an internal reference, and the relative expression of mir-125a was evaluated using u6 as an internal reference.
additionally, the following thermocycling conditions were used for qPCR: initial denaturation at 95˚C for 2 min; denaturation at 95˚C for 5 sec and annealing at 61˚C for 10 sec.
all the results were calculated using the 2 -∆∆Cq method

Discussion
in the present study, a Pc12 cellular ad model was constructed, and the effects of lnc-anril knockdown were evaluated on apoptosis, neurite outgrowth and inflammatory cytokine levels.
in addition, whether lnc-anril knockdown regulated cell functions, as well as inflammation by regulating mir-125a, in the Pc12 cellular ad model was determined.
It was determined that: i) lnc-ANRIL knockdown inhibited apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine expression, while it increased neurite outgrowth and mir-125a expression in the PC12 cellular AD model; and ii) miR-125a inhibition weakened the effect of lnc-anril knockdown in the Pc12 cellular AD model, and lnc-ANRIL directly bound miR-125a.
ad is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex etiology, in which the major pathological change that has been established is the formation of Aβ plaques
In order to better understand the development of AD and prevent, as well as treat, the disease, an increasing number of mechanisms apart from neurodegeneration have been revealed, such as the dysregulation of immune cells, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and inflammation
lncRNAs may serve predominant roles in regulating multiple pathways related to ad progression
Therefore, in the present study, one of the most promising lncrnas, lnc-anril, was selected to investigate its possible role in AD pathogenesis based on previous findings of lnc-ANRIL in regulating neuron functions and inflammation
lnc-anril, located on chromosome 9, has 62 transcripts with the longest one being 9091 nt (transcript ID: CDKN2B-AS1:34,
id=ANRIL&page=0).
lnc-ANRIL silencing was demonstrated to reduce the injury induced by H 2 o 2 in a cellular model of spinal cord injury by promoting cell viability, migration and invasion, and suppressing cell apoptosis, as well as autophagy, by mediating miR-499a/programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) axis-regulated Pi3K/akt/mTor/p70S6K signaling
Inflammatory responses regulated by lnc-ANRIL were revealed to reduce the therapeutic effect of rhein in rats with uric acid nephropathy
lnc-anril was revealed to enhance the activation of inflammasome by regulating miR-122-5p/BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) signaling in rat models of uric acid nephropathy
Notably, a previous study revealed that lnc-ANRIL downregulation re-established the learning and memory capabilities and prevented the apoptosis of hippocampal pyramidal neurons by mediating the NF-κB pathway in rat models of diabetic mellitus
These studies suggest that lnc-ANRIL overexpression promotes inflammation, while lnc-anril knockdown reduces inflammation and alleviates neuronal injury.
Notably, there are also studies illustrating an anti-inflammatory role of lnc-anril in various diseases
For example, a high expression of lnc-anril was associated with a decreased risk of acute exacerbation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease stage in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
This indicated that lnc-anril may play a dual role in regulating inflammation.
in the present study, it was revealed that lnc-ANRIL knockdown inhibited apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine expression, promoted neurite outgrowth and negatively regulated mir-125a in the Pc12 cellular ad model, indicating that lnc-ANRIL may be a critical factor in regulating ad pathogenesis.
in view of these results, the present study aimed to elucidate the following: i) The effect of lnc-anril on cell functions in the Pc12 cellular ad model (lnc-ANRIL can promote cell apoptosis, while it inhibits cell growth in the PC12 cellular AD model by regulating multiple signaling pathways, including the mir-499a/Pdcd4 axisregulated PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway); and ii) the effect of lnc-ANRIL on inflammatory cytokines in the PC12 cellular AD model.
Inflammation is a critical process in ad pathogenesis and lnc-anril is an lncrna closely related to the regulation of inflammation by functioning as a regulator of nF-κB signaling; thus, lnc-ANRIL may regulate cytokine expression in the PC12 cellular AD model by mediating nF-κB signaling or via other inflammatory pathways, such as the Brcc3 signaling pathway
mir-125a is a promising factor in the regulation of cell functions and inflammation in diseases related to abnormal inflammatory responses and/or neuronal dysfunction
For instance, miR-125a-5p was revealed to relieve inflammation and seizure in a rat model of pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy by targeting calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV
Additionally, miR-125a inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines by targeting E26 transformation-specific-1 in intestinal mucosa collected from patients with inflammatory bowel disease
In addition, miR-125a negativity modulated the levels of the pro-inflammatory chemokine expressed and secreted by normal T cell, by targeting Krüppel-like factor 13 in T cells separated from patients with Sle (30).
Furthermore, mir-125a could activate vitamin d receptors in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which may enhance the treatment effect of vitamin d in multiple sclerosis; miR-125a and vitamin D receptor are both located at the same neurons of the ventral horn
However, mir-125a appears to act as a pro-inflammatory factor as well.
Bilobalide was revealed to ameliorate the inflammation induced by IL-17 by reducing the expression of miR-125a in ATCD5 cells
These findings suggest that the effect of mir-125a in the mediation of inflammation is bidirectional.
In addition, there are also studies demonstrating the regulatory role of mir-125a in pathological processes related to neurology
For instance, the decrease of mir-125a resulted in the increase of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MaPK) in the trigeminal ganglions of rats with orofacial inflammatory pain
Sodium vitamin C transporter 2 reduced oxidative injury by modulating JnK/p38 MaPK, nF-κB and mirna125a-5p in a rat model of ethanol-induced neurotoxicity
additionally, there are studies that revealed that il-6 is a target of mir-125a in regulating inflammation and other inflammation-related processes
These findings indicated that miR-125a is involved in the regulation of neurodysfunction.
in the present study, it was determined that lnc-anril knockdown suppressed apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine expression, while it enhanced neurite outgrowth in a Pc12 cellular AD model.
In addition, miR-125a inhibition suppressed the effect of lnc-anril knockdown on cell functions and inflammation; lnc-ANRIL also directly bound miR-125a.
These findings revealed a possible mechanism of the regulatory role of lnc-anril in ad pathogenesis.
However, further studies are required to address the more profound mechanisms in the future.
in addition, the present study did not evaluate the effect of mir-125a overexpression on cell functions of the Pc12 cellular ad model with lnc-anril knockdown, which should be investigated in future studies.
However, these experiments were not conducted in the present study since lncanril increased mir-125a expression in the Pc12 cellular ad model, which, to a certain extent, indicated that the addition of a mir-125a overexpression group was not necessary.
There were several limitations to the present study.
First, the present study did not evaluate the expression levels of lnc-anril and its target (mir-125a) in patients with ad or in an animal model; thus, further studies are required to conduct such experiments in the future.
Second, the effect of lnc-anril overexpression on cell functions of the Pc12 cellular model was not detected; this also needs to be assessed in future experiments.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that lnc-ANRIL knockdown suppressed apoptosis and inflammation, while it promoted neurite outgrowth via binding miR-125a in a Pc12 cellular ad model.
