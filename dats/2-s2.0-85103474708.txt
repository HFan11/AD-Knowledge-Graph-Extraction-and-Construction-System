Genetic Variability in Molecular Pathways Implicated in Alzheimer's Disease: A Comprehensive Review
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, affecting a significant part of the population.
The majority of AD cases occur in the elderly with a typical age of onset of the disease above 65 years.
AD presents a major burden for the healthcare system and since population is rapidly aging, the burden of the disease will increase in the future.
However, no effective drug treatment for a full-blown disease has been developed to date.
The genetic background of AD is extensively studied; numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified significant genes associated with increased risk of AD development.
This review summarizes more than 100 risk loci.
Many of them may serve as biomarkers of AD progression, even in the preclinical stage of the disease.
Furthermore, we used GWAS data to identify key pathways of AD pathogenesis: cellular processes, metabolic processes, biological regulation, localization, transport, regulation of cellular processes, and neurological system processes.
Gene clustering into molecular pathways can provide background for identification of novel molecular targets and may support the development of tailored and personalized treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in human brain
The mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are still not entirely elucidated
The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in form of insoluble plaques and aggregation of protein tau in neuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are considered as two important hallmarks of AD
AD is the most common neurodegenerative brain disease and a significant part of worldwide population is affected.
AD, as the leading cause of dementia, contributes to 60-65% of all cognitive decline cases
Reports suggest that roughly 47 million people suffered from dementia in 2015
The mean incidence of AD is estimated to 1-3%, with a prevalence of 10-30% in population above 65 years of age
As population is aging, the prevalence will increase, making dementia one of the most important health issues in the future.
Projections suggest that more than 13 million people will suffer from AD in the United States alone and 11.8% of all people globally will be affected by the 2050
A small proportion of AD cases show familial, highly inheritable form of AD, contributing to <1% of AD.
Early age of onset is associated with this type of AD, that is also known as dominant inherited Alzheimer's disease
Furthermore, mutations in three common genes-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) are associated with early-onset AD (EOAD), developing in fourth or fifth decade of life
However, not all EOAD cases can be explained with these mutations.
Late-onset AD (LOAD) cases comprise the vast majority of all AD patients (>90%), with the typical age of onset above 65 years
Complex genetic and environmental interactions have been associated with risk for sporadic LOAD
Studies suggest LOAD is not as strongly linked to familial background as EOAD, but genetic factors can contribute importantly to AD risk even late in life
Contrary to EOAD, there are no highly penetrant mutations in a set of known genes; instead multiple low penetrance genetic variants can confer risk for LOAD
Although AD generally manifests in older population, first changes in biomarkers levels, such as Aβ 42 and phosphorylated tau (ptau 181 ) can be observed already 15-20 years prior to the onset of the clinical symptoms
Furthermore, functional and molecular imaging of brain with single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography (PET) provides valuable early information about the underlying pathological processes such as glucose metabolism, accumulation of tau and Aβ or neuroinflammation
Biomarkers are usually used to inform and support the diagnostic of the disease when cognitive decline has already become apparent
Using biomarkers for improved diagnostic in non-demented individuals could contribute to better understanding of neurodegenerative changes late in life and support development and implementation of novel therapeutic approaches.
Some asymptomatic changes that precede typical AD cognitive symptoms can be observed in patients before the clinical diagnosis.
For instance, increased biomarkers levels in adults without symptoms of cognitive impairment are typical for preclinical AD, whereas the earliest symptomatic stage when cognitive symptoms are present, but not reaching the threshold for AD dementia diagnosis, is known as prodromal AD
Another clinical stage associated with AD is mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
MCI is a clinical stage of progressive cognitive impairment exceeding the expected cognitive decline for age and education status
Since around 50% of MCI patients develop AD in 5 years from diagnosis, MCI is often considered as an intermediate stage between normal aging and AD
Adults with diagnosed MCI show milder cognitive decline Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid-β; AD, Alzheimer's disease; APP, amyloid precursor protein; EOAD, Early onset Alzheimer's disease; CNS, central nervous system; GO, Gene Ontology; GWAS, genome-wide association study; IGAP, International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project; LOAD, Late onset Alzheimer's disease; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; NFT, neurofibrillary tangles; PET, positron emission tomography; PSEN1, presenilin-1; PSEN2, presenilin-2; T2D, Type 2 diabetes; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
and higher degree of independence in functional status than patients with AD
There are several studies trying to detect or predict the conversion from MCI to AD
Since therapeutic interventions are more efficient during the MCI or in early stage of AD, sensitive and reliable methods for identification of cognitive decline should be used in clinical practice
Common genetic polymorphisms in genes that encode proteins involved in different biological pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of LOAD could influence its development and progression.
This review summarizes the latest knowledge on genetics and genomics of AD susceptibility, compiled by GWASs and their meta-analyses.
In addition we have performed gene clustering of the genomic loci and molecular pathways in development and progression of MCI and AD with the aim of facilitating identification of novel biomarkers or treatment targets.

METHODS
A literature search was performed in NHGRI-EBI platform "GWAS catalog, " aiming to systematically gather vast dataset of genome-wide studies and meta-analysis of complex diseases
A total of 96 GWAS and metaanalyses were included in the database until the end of December 2019.
For each loci, identified by GWAS, a PubMed literature search was performed with the help of the following words: "Alzheimer's disease and gene name" or "Alzheimer's disease and polymorphisms and gene name."
Novel references, assessing the risk for the disease on the genome-wide level, were included in the review.
Applied exclusion criteria were expression studies, studies not implementing case-control design, studies overlapping with other diseases and studies performed on a defined set of genes-not genome-wide design (Supplementary Figure
In total, GWAS (n = 54) and metaanalyses combining multiple GWAS dataset (n = 21) in AD risk evaluation were included (Supplementary Tables
Nine studies combined GWAS and meta-analysis approach in identifying AD risk loci.
Studies evaluating the association of GWAS and meta-analysis dataset with disease biomarkers (n = 16) were analyzed separately (Figure
Multiple studies (n = 13) combined identified genotype alterations in GWAS and metaanalyses with changes in AD-related biomarkers (Figure
A total of 105 AD risk loci were identified with additional 30 loci related to biomarker oscillations.
For the obtained gene loci, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed, using Cytoscape plug-in ClueGO (Figure
This tool enables to find statistically overrepresented GO pathways in a set of genes and their visual representation in a functional network
We focused on GO-biological process only.
Analysis for AD risk and biomarker set of genes was performed separately (Supplementary Tables
Next, list of GO overrepresented pathways was visualized with NaviGO analytic tool, to find common GO parental pathways
Terms were FIGURE 1 | Flowchart of the study design and GO analysis.
Literature search of GWAS and meta-analyses was performed in "GWAS catalog," to obtain a list of AD-related genes.
All of the studies were manually reviewed and some further literature search of identified gene loci was performed in PubMed.
One hundred and five AD risk loci and 30 loci related to biomarker oscillations were used for GO enrichment analysis in two separate gene sets.
Genes that were not enriched in performed GO analysis, were manually annotated to corresponding categories.
manually curated with QuickGO web browser
Genes that did not reach significant threshold in GO analysis, were manually annotated in one of the identified categories, using DAVID functional annotation tool (Figure

GENES AND MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IMPLICATED IN MCI AND AD RISK
In our dataset of genes related to AD risk, we observed significant enrichment for four major GO biological process categories: cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, and localization (Figure

Metabolic Processes
Since accumulation of insoluble proteins like Aβ is one of the hallmarks in neuropathology of AD, different metabolic processes are involved in their processing.
Aβ is proteolytic product of APP cleavage by enzymes of the γ-and β-secretase (BACE) family that includes PS1 and PS2
Studies of inherited form of EOAD suggest that mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes result in overproduction of the hydrophobic Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 peptides, leading to aggregation and formation of insoluble plaques
Normally, Aβ plaques are being degraded and cleared in processes driven by glial cells
Insufficient clearance, due to the excessive aggregation of plaques, can affect surrounding synapses
Several lines of evidence support the genetic basis of amyloid cascade hypothesis.
Firstly, known mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes associated with familial AD or EOAD affect the generation or aggregation propensity of Aβ
Secondly, the APP gene is located on 21th chromosome and patients with Down's syndrome (the trisomy of the 21 chromosome) have increased risk for early development of memory impairment
Thirdly, apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele (APOE4), which is associated with more extensive Aβ deposition is considered a major risk factor for LOAD
It is estimated that 40-65% of AD patients have at least one copy of this allele
However, no successful therapies targeting amyloid accumulation have been implemented to date, suggesting the importance of other pathways that are also disrupted in AD
Genes and key SNPs included in metabolic processes, associated with AD risk in GWAS and meta-analyses, are summarized in Table
Among all AD-related genetic risk factors, APOE on chromosome 19 is considered the strongest one and is also the most investigated in the literature.
Two common APOE polymorphisms, rs429358 (p.Cys112Arg) and rs7412 (p.Arg158Cys) define polymorphic alleles APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 that encode three respective protein variants: apoE2 (Cys112, Cys158), apoE3 (Cys112, Arg158), and apoE4 (Arg112, Arg158)
Substitution of one or two amino acids affects the total charge and structure of APOE, leading to alteration in binding to cellular receptors and lipoprotein particles and possibly changing the stability and rate of production and clearance
Among all populations, APOE3 allele is the most frequent (50-90%), followed by APOE4 (5-35%) and APOE2 allele (1-5%)
The association of APOE4 with increased AD risk and an earlier age of onset of AD was confirmed
One or two copies of the APOE4  allele increases LOAD risk for 3-or 12-fold and contribute to ∼50% LOAD
Although APOE4 allele is widely considered as a major genetic risk factor for AD, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of the disease
On the other hand, a protective effect of APOE2 was shown
GWAS studies confirmed APOE rs429358 was associated with increased AD risk, while rs7412 was associated with decreased AD risk
Furthermore, APOE rs429358 showed increased risk for AD, while a protective role of APOE rs405509 was reported
Role of APOE in catabolism of triglyceriderich lipoproteins is well-studied
APOE regulates their metabolism through binding to ApoE receptors, directing the transport, delivery, and distribution of lipoproteins
Discovery of APOE immunoreactivity in Aβ deposits and NFT, hallmarks of AD pathology, was an important research milestone in AD
Besides APOE, a lot of other LOAD susceptibility loci involved in different metabolic processes have been reported to date (Table

GENES ASSOCIATED WITH AD BIOMARKER LEVELS
Changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma biomarker levels can predict neurodegenerative changes in AD progression and memory decline and are often used in clinical diagnostics.
Except for their diagnostic potential, biomarkers can be applied in studies of AD molecular mechanisms and could be used to monitor the biochemical effects of potential disease intervention
Genetic variability in different molecular pathways can contribute to differences in biomarker levels.
The search for early, reliable and accurate biomarkers for AD progression exceeds genetic approach.
Epigenetic factors may play an important role, and the potential of non-coding regulatory RNAs, especially miRNA as biomarkers of AD progression in body fluids has been extensively studied
Furthermore, functional neuroimaging provides insight into metabolic and biochemical alterations in the brain, such as glucose metabolism, perfusion, deposition of Aβ and tau protein aggregation
Thus, GWAS studies and meta-analyses often implement genome-wide genetic data in biomarker studies, to associate mutations or polymorphisms with measurable changes in components of body fluids and brain imaging in AD (Table
Apart from identifying novel genetic risk loci, Beecham et al. performed the assessment of the presence of neurofibrillary plaques and tangles, immunohistochemical detection of αsynuclein and neuropathological evaluation in most of the IGAP identified risk loci
In the biomarker gene set, seven major GO categories were enriched: cellular process, metabolic process, biological regulation, localization, transport, regulation of cellular process, and neurological system process (Figure
Since biomarker gene set enrichment resulted in three additional major categories, some of the genes can be found in different major categories compared to AD risk gene set.
Furthermore, transport can be understood as a subcategory of metabolic process, while regulation of cellular process is part of biological regulation and cellular process.
Several biomarker associated loci overlap with risk-related genes (CASS4, PICALM, SORL1, APOE, CLU, CD33, CR1, MEF2C, NECTIN2, ZCWPW1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, and PTK2B) linked to molecular pathways identified in this review (Table

CONCLUSION AND FURTHER PERSPECTIVES
Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide.
A lot of research focuses on the identification of genetic factors that may contribute to the development and progression of the disease.
Numerous GWASs and meta-analyses reported different genetic factors associated with AD risk or biomarker levels.
A cumulative effect of small but significant contributions of numerous genetic factors can at least in part elucidate the LOAD progression.
The pathogenic processes in AD may be influenced on a personalized basis by a combination of variants in key genes and pathways.
Apart from serving as a hallmark of the disease, polymorphisms in various genes might help in early diagnostics and prediction of disease progression.
Integration of genetic factors and biomarker status may increase the predictive value of diagnostic or prognostic models.
Through the GO analysis we compiled a list of the most enriched pathways, associated with AD pathology.
Among four GO parental categories in AD risk gene set, immune response, APP metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, endocytosis and biological regulation on different levels can be exposed as important AD related biological processes.
Furthermore, enrichment analysis on smaller AD biomarker gene set pinpointed three additional parental categories.
Besides neurodegeneration, numerous research evidence link AD with neuroinflammation, lipid metabolism as well as receptor mediated endocytosis, supporting scientific background of our analysis.
Several identified genes were associated with more than one biologic process, represented in various GO categories.
The intersection of different biological processes creates a complex interconnected network, suggesting multi-pathway approach in AD genetic background evaluation is needed.
Additionally, manual annotation of genes that were not associated with the most significant pathways in GO analysis, could help to elucidate their function in AD pathogenesis.
This comprehensive summary of genetic variants identified by GWAS studies and their meta-analyses can also provide background for identification of novel molecular targets, and the results may be important for development of personalized medicine.
However, GWAS and meta-analyses cannot explain the molecular mechanisms of the contribution of a novel susceptibility locus to the overall genetic risk.
Therefore, our compiled and annotated results may serve as a basis for the functional studies of pathophysiological mechanisms of risk genes, identified on a genome-wide scale.
Furthermore, better characterization of risk genes functions could enable the stratification of AD patients according to the main molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, supporting development of tailored and personalized treatment of the disease.
