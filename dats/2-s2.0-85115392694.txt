Plasma p-tau181 Level Predicts Neurodegeneration and Progression to Alzheimer's Dementia: A Longitudinal Study
Background: Plasma-based biomarkers would be potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because they are more available and cost-effective than cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or neuroimaging.
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) in plasma could be an accurate AD predictor.
Methods: Participants from the ADNI database included 185 cognitively unimpaired subjects with negative Aβ (CU-), 66 subjects with pre-clinical AD (CU with positive Aβ), 164 subjects with mild cognitive impairment with negative Aβ (MCI-), 254 subjects with prodromal AD (MCI with positive Aβ), and 98 subjects with dementia.
Multiple linear regression models, linear mixed-effects models, and local regression were used to explore cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of plasma p-tau181 with cognition, neuroimaging, or CSF biomarkers adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOE genotype.
Besides, Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox-regression model were performed to predict the risk of progression to dementia.
Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive value of p-tau181.
Results: Plasma p-tau181 level was highest in AD dementia, followed by prodromal AD and pre-clinical AD.
In pre-clinical AD, plasma p-tau181 was negatively associated with hippocampal volume (β = -0.031,
p-value = 0.017).
In prodromal AD, plasma p-tau181 was associated with decreased global cognition, executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial functioning (β range -0.119 to -0.273, p-value < 0.05) and correlated with hippocampal volume (β = -0.028,
p-value < 0.005) and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) volume (β = 0.02, p-value = 0.01).
In AD dementia, increased plasma p-tau181 was associated with worse memory.
In the whole group, baseline plasma p-tau181 was significantly associated with longitudinal increases in multiple neuropsychological test z-scores and correlated with AD-related CSF biomarkers and hippocampal volume (p-value < 0.05).
Meanwhile, CU or MCI with Wang et al.
Plasma p-tau181 and Alzheimer's Dementia high plasma p-tau181 carried a higher risk of progression to dementia.
The area under the curve (AUC) of the adjusted model (age, sex, education, APOE genotype, and plasma p-tau181) was 0.78; that of additionally included CSF biomarkers was 0.84.
Plasma p-tau181 level is related to multiple AD-associated cognitive domains and AD-related CSF biomarkers at the clinical stages of AD.
Moreover, plasma p-tau181 level is related to the change rates of cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy.
Thus, this study confirms the utility of plasma p-tau181 as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection and prediction of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologically characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau, the major components of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of dementia causing progressive cognitive decline
CSF Aβ42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were core AD-diagnostic biomarkers and CSF Aβ42/Aβ 40 could further improve the diagnostic accuracy
The diagnostic criteria for AD was established based on amyloidosis, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proposed by the National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer Association
Though PET and CSF biomarkers are invaluable in AD-related brain pathology, the use of PET imaging and lumbar puncture is restricted to limited centers because of high prices, radiopharmaceuticals, and invasiveness.
Conventional structural MRI neuroimaging is often used to evaluate AD progression.
However, the advanced MR techniques are of limited value in AD diagnosis due to high heterogeneity, low sensitivity, and low signal-to-noise ratios
Therefore, an affordable, non-invasive means is essential for large-scale screening programs and longitudinal studies.
The previous study has developed a new ATN framework, focused on plasma biomarkers including Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratio (A), plasma p-tau181 (T), and neurofilament light (N)
Plasma Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratio was decreased in cognitively normal subjects with subjective cognitive decline, the earliest stage of AD, and plasma Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 level can predict amyloid-PET status
Nevertheless, peripheral production of Aβ peptides makes it difficult for clinical practice
Plasma neurofilament light level was increased in patients with AD
Recent prospective studies found that blood p-tau181 can be a potential diagnostic marker of AD
A study of familial AD indicated that plasma p-tau181 level was increased before symptom onset
However, longitudinal analysis is scarce on plasma p-tau181 prognostic value for progression to dementia and relationships between plasma p-tau181 and multiple ADassociated cognitive domains remain unclear.
In the present study, we investigated longitudinal associations of plasma p-tau181 with AD-related CSF biomarkers, multiple cognitive domains, and volumes of hippocampus and white matter hyperintensity (WMH).
Moreover, we assessed the value of plasma p-tau181 in predicting progression to dementia and compared the diagnostic values of different models.

METHODS

Study Population
Participants were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data (
The ADNI database was initiated in 2003 to detect MCI and early AD dementia progression based on the combinations of CSF or plasma biomarkers, serial MRI, PET, and clinical and neuropsychological information.
This project was approved by institutional review boards of all participating institutions and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before inclusion in the study.
The study included 767 ADNI participants with baseline plasma p-tau181.
Definitions of the participant classifications have been described in the previous study, including cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia
Besides, in this study, the threshold values of Aβ were 880 pg/ml for CSF Aβ1-42 or 1.11 SUVR for AV45-PET scan
Then, CU and MCI subjects were split into four subgroups: subjects with negative Aβ-related pathological changes (CUand MCI-) and subjects with positive Aβ-related pathological changes (CU+ and MCI+).
CU+ subjects were regarded as patients with pre-clinical AD and MCI+ subjects were regarded as patients with prodromal AD.
The enrollment flow chart is given in Supplementary Figure

Plasma p-tau181 Quantification
Level of plasma p-tau181 was quantified with the Single Molecule array (Simoa) technique combined with two monoclonal antibodies (Tau12 and AT270), as described previously
Moreover, the analysis of plasma p-tau181 was carried out at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

Cognitive Evaluation
The general cognition was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and composite scores were used to reflect memory, executive function, and language-related and visuospatial domains.
All these neuropsychological tests were evaluated at baseline and yearly thereafter.

Neuroimaging Analyses
The average of the mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated using four cortical regions (frontal, anterior cingulate, precuneus, and parietal cortex) normalized to the whole cerebellum.
WMH volume was computed with the segmentation of high-resolution 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR sequences based on a Bayesian approach.
The average volume of the right and left hippocampus was obtained using FreeSurfer software (

CSF Measurements
Levels of Aβ, total tau (t-tau), and p-tau in CSF were measured using Elecsys immunoassays at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Sweden (BioFINDER)
or at the Biomarker Research Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, USA

Statistical Analyses
The level of plasma p-tau181 was compared between five subgroups with the Mann-Whitney U test.
The rate of change in plasma p-tau181 was calculated in linear mixedeffects models with age, sex, education, and APOE genotype as covariates.
Baseline associations of plasma p-tau181 with cognition and other biomarkers were tested by linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, education, and APOE genotype.
Associations of baseline plasma p-tau181 with longitudinal level of other biomarkers were tested by linear mixed-effects models.
The local regression was employed for associations between baseline plasma p-tau181 and the change rate of other biomarkers.
Furthermore, clinical progression to dementia was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank test.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) of the key biomarkers of plasma and CSF were calculated to predict progression to dementia.
All tests used

p = 5.44E-08), MOCA (β = -0.089,
p = 4.07E-05), ADNI_EF (β = -0.073,

As demonstrated in Figure

Analyses of Longitudinal Conversion to Dementia
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that subjects with higher levels (>14.982
pg/ml) of plasma p-tau181 were associated with higher progression compared to those with lower levels (<14.981
pg/ml) of plasma p-tau181 (log-rank p < 0.0001; Figure
The basic model (model 1: age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 genotype) discriminated clinical progression with the AUC of 0.69; when it included plasma, p-tau181 (model 2) was 0.77, Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau of CSF (model 3) was 0.83, and all above (model 4) included was 0.84 (Figure

DISCUSSION
This longitudinal study demonstrated that plasma p-tau181 level was elevated during the clinical progression of dementia, and associations with CSF biomarkers, different cognitive and imaging markers were validated.
Our findings highlighted that plasma p-tau181 was (1) positively associated with CSF ttau and p-tau in pre-clinical AD, prodromal AD, and dementia stage; (2) longitudinally correlated with change and change rate of global cognition, executive function, memory, languagerelated, and visuospatial domains and hippocampal volume; (3) significantly predictive of clinical conversion to dementia.
We showed that plasma p-tau181 of subjects with positive Aβ were higher than subjects with negative Aβ.
Consistent with previous investigations, increased plasma p-tau181 level was associated with increased Aβ pathology
Moreover, the change of plasma p-tau181 occurred before the onset of abnormal  Aβ pathology, indicating that accumulation of Aβ could stimulate the early increase in plasma p-tau181
As expected, strong associations were found between plasma and CSF levels of p-tau181, indicating that plasma p-tau181 might be used as a surrogate marker of tau pathology, as well as CSF p-tau
However, the DELCODE study had demonstrated that plasma tau was not related to core markers of CSF in the stage of subjective cognitive decline
In line with the previous study
Additionally, plasma p-tau181 was significantly related to CSF t-tau/Aβ and p-tau/Aβ ratios, but not CSF Aβ, in pre-clinical AD and prodromal AD.
This was supported by previous studies that ratios were more accurate biomarkers than single ones in predicting the progression of AD
Previous studies had demonstrated that plasma p-tau181 was correlated with cognitive decline
Interestingly, the baseline plasma p-tau181 had an S-shaped relationship with global cognition and multiple cognitive domains in our study.
Besides, in the stage of prodromal AD, the baseline plasma p-tau181 showed obvious correlations with changes of cognitions and hippocampal atrophy.
The associations of plasma p-tau181 with hippocampal atrophy and gray matter loss indicated that plasma p-tau181 was related to Alzheimer's neuronal loss
Furthermore, the linear mixed-effects model analysis suggested that plasma p-tau181 related to WMH volume in prodromal AD (p = 0.01).
From this, it could be speculated that plasma p-tau181 was relevant to cerebrovascular disease.
What is more, associations are also presented as S-shaped patterns between plasma p-tau181 and change rates of global cognition, executive function, memory, language-related, and visuospatial abilities, as well as hippocampal atrophy rate.
Therefore, it could be hypothesized that there is a threshold period for p-tau181 and only moderate levels of p-tau181 are associated with change rates of the above indicators.
After a specific range of p-tau181, these effects are gradually leveling out.
The changes of phosphorylation sites are different at different stages of AD progression, besides plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 are increased 20 years before the formation of tau aggregates
Consistent with prior research, plasma p-tau181 was a potential biomarker for diagnosing AD and predicting AD progression
Plasma p-tau181 was a specific marker in AD dementia, which can distinguish AD from frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal basal syndrome, primary progressive aphasia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy
In patients with familial AD, the level of plasma p-tau181 was comparable among APP and PSEN1 mutation carriers
Though plasma p-tau181 changed without a specific gene, it was associated with APOE ε4
The association between tau and APOE ε4 was also independent of Aβ, primarily mediated by activated microglia
Nevertheless, several limitations should be addressed in this study.
Firstly, the ADNI study is mainly based on Caucasoid populations, and consequently, the results may not be directly applied to other racial/ethnic groups.
Secondly, due to the strict inclusion criteria, individuals with severe vascular pathology were excluded, which probably attenuated relevance between plasma p-tau181 and cerebrovascular diseases.
Also, follow-up data of biomarkers were not complete, and therefore, we cannot test whether plasma p-tau181 was congruent with CSF p-tau181 and tau PET.
In summary, plasma p-tau181 was increased from the preclinical stage of AD and longitudinally associated with multiple cognitive domains decline and hippocampal atrophy.
Thus, plasma p-tau181, a readily accessible biomarker, could be of high predictive and diagnostic values for AD.
However, international multicenter, large-sample, and longitudinal studies are needed to validate these hypotheses.
