Nanomedicine: A Promising Way to Manage Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease of the aging population characterized by the progressive and slow brain decay due to the formation of extracellular plaques in the hippocampus.
AD cells encompass tangles of twisted strands of aggregated microtubule binding proteins surrounded by plaques.
Delivering corresponding drugs in the brain to deal with these clinical pathologies, we face a naturally built strong, protective barrier between circulating blood and brain cells called the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Nanomedicines provide state-of-the-art alternative approaches to overcome the challenges in drug transport across the BBB.
The current review presents the advances in the roles of nanomedicines in both the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
We intend to provide an overview of how nanotechnology has revolutionized the approaches used to manage AD and highlight the current key bottlenecks and future perspective in this field.
Furthermore, the emerging nanomedicines for managing brain diseases like AD could promote the booming growth of research and their clinical availability.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition of the aging population characterized by the progressive and slow brain decay due to plaque formation in the hippocampus
It has been found that the formation of those plaques starts up about 20 years before the onset of clinical symptoms, which makes the exact trajectory of pathologies associated with AD unclear
The incidence of AD is rising worldwide.
More than 50 million people were affected with AD in 2019, and its burden is continuously rising, which may lead to an enormous effect on both the world economy and manpower
It is estimated that by the middle of the current century, 13.8 million Americans of age 65 and older may have AD symptoms.
AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where the death rate has increased to 146.2% in 2018 and 122,019 people died
There are several limitations to deal with the pathology of AD.
The drugs used to cure the cognitive impairments of the brain in AD are based on the neurotransmitters or enzyme modulation with the intranasal route for their delivery to the brain
However, with the use of these drugs, frequent therapy failures are being reported due to their less absorption in neuronal cell membranes, instability, brain toxicity, and other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters
Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) with unique physicochemical properties and the capability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be a promising strategy to solve these biomedical and pharmacological problems in the treatment of brain diseases like AD
The delivery of drugs to the brain through these NPs could enhance the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the drugs with minimal toxicity
The therapeutic potential of the drugs can be increased by employing nanotechnology-based drug delivery approaches
The most essential advantage of nanomedicines for the treatment of brain diseases like AD is the controlled release of drugs at a particular site
The synthesis of these NPs for drug delivery is an emerging approach, a multidisciplinary field that provides new understandings and opens avenues to manipulate materials, tissues, cells, and DNA with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 150 nm
Nanomedicine has made considerable achievements in many fields including medicines, pharmacy, chemical/biological detection, and optics
The present study intends to provide an overview of how nanotechnology has revolutionized AD treatment/imaging and the understanding of cellular function by mainly focusing on the state-of-the-art nanomedicine-based approaches used for AD.
The current key bottlenecks and future perspective in this field are also highlighted.
In this review, we depict the advances and merits of nanomedicines in the treatment of AD, believing that the emerging nanomedicines could promote the booming growth of research in this field and become clinically available for the diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic interventions for AD and other similar central nervous system (CNS) disorders in the future.

PATHOGENESIS OF AD
For a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, it is essential to identify the targets for direct therapy and intervention at the earlier stages when the changes are reversible.
The prominent features in AD onset are the appearance of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaque formation in the brain.
The histopathologic traits include hippocampal neuronal loss, synaptic degeneration, and aneuploidy.
Moreover, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microbial infection, mitochondrial dysfunction, and a compromised brain lymphatic system have also been recognized as early pathophysiological modifications in the course of AD
There are several physiological factors involved in the onset of AD
The lifestyleand age-related factors can aggravate the progression of AD.
The following subsections describe these factors to better understand the pathogenesis of AD.

Hypertension
The most associated, age-dependent factor that contributes to the development of AD in an aged population is hypertension.
Although the mechanisms of this association are complex, it is considered that hypertension can influence AD through the association of cerebrovascular pathology
Hypertension-high blood pressure may also contribute to the pathology of AD as the investigation indicates that hypertension leads to the increased plaque formation in the brain

Diabetes Mellitus
Recent findings have revealed the associations between high sugar level and AD development.
It has been found that MA-[D-leu-4]-OB3 used for the treatment of obesity and diabetes can relieve AD pathologies
About the association of AD and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), a study has reported that the depletion of caveolin-1 in T2DM can induce AD
Recently, a theoretic support is depicted on the association of diabetes and AD with new targets to prevent the diabetic patients from AD
It has also been observed that preventive measurements against diabetes like weight-diet balance, sports, and other physical activities could relieve AD

Homocysteine
Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, plays an essential role in AD-related pathologies and participates in the elevation of beta amyloid (Aβ) plaque formation
Additionally, homocysteine may contribute in raising the oxidative stress in the brain that leads to the progression of AD pathologies

Inflammatory Biomarkers
Inflammatory biomarkers including C-reactive proteins, interleulin-6, fibrinogen, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and other lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 have a strong association with total dementia risk
However, more findings need further evaluations.

Obesity
As aforementioned, there is lack of literature for better evaluation of the risk factors involved in the onset of AD, but there are suggestions from different studies on the relation of midlife obesity and increased AD risk.
Nevertheless, with some nonconformities, the studies based on neuroimaging, adiposity, and cognitive decline support the association of obesity and AD development

Physical Activity
Many investigations have verified the notion that the progression of AD is associated with the physical activity of a person.
Healthy physical activities could retard the cognitive decline in older adults
Similarly, other studies have shown that the brain is more active during exercises such as meditation and yoga
It has also been reported that physical activity is significantly correlated with gut microbiota that play roles in the prevention and development of AD
Another study has proved the benefit of regular exercise for AD, suggesting that exercise exerts anti-inflammatory effects and provides other numerous benefits through different pathways that might help in preventing the progression of AD
However, the inverse correlation of physical activity and cognitive decline needs further investigations.

Role of BBB in the Pathogenesis of AD
The human CNS is a complex system that is well distinguished by two specialized barriers in the form of cerebrospinal fluid barrier (CSFB) and BBB
BBB plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD.
In AD, cerebrovascular dysfunction results in cognitive impairment and dementia, which may lead to cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
It also mediates the accumulation of Aβ peptides in the brain.
The BBB is important for the regulation of Aβ transport to brain via two primary receptors, namely, (1) receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and (
The faulty clearance of Aβ via the deregulated RAGE/LRP1 receptors, arterial dysfunction, and impaired angiogenesis may commence Aβ accumulation, neurovascular uncoupling, brain hypoperfusion, cerebrovascular regression, and neurovascular inflammation.
Eventually, these events result in compromised BBB and subsequent neuronal and synaptic impairment

BBB: A LIMITING FACTOR IN DRUG DELIVERY TO BRAIN
Blood-brain barrier plays a pivotal role in shuttling biomolecules in and out of the brain neuronal system.
Therefore, understanding the structural and functional characteristics of BBB is essential for improving the drug delivery to the brain.
This protective unit factor helps to prevent shuttling of molecules between blood and brain composed of vascular endothelial cell layers bound back by tight junctions and other supportive structures
The endothelial cells are surrounded by a basement membrane covered by astrocyte end-feet and continuously monitored by surveying microglial cells
Cohesive domains, bound to endothelial cells, provide perseverance for the selective transport of small molecules across the BBB
To meet the requirements of proteins and peptides for brain homeostasis, a controlled intracellular transport occurs via transcytosis.
Depending on the nature of the molecules (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), endothelial cells with the help of various special transporting proteins could facilitate the transport.
To cure brain illness like AD, different nanocarriers have been reported in preclinical studies.
These carriers encapsulate the drugs against AD as cargo and cross the BBB.
For a detailed view of the transcytosis and nanocarrier transport across the BBB, readers are referred to recent reviews on these topics

NOSE-TO-BRAIN DRUG DELIVERY AND LIMITATIONS
The delivery of drugs to the brain via the nasal route generally starts from the respiratory epithelium to the olfactory region with the help of the trigeminal nerve and olfactory nerve cells.
This drug delivery route is supposed to transport the drug molecules to different parts of the brain including the frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, cerebrum, and brain stem
To deal with AD, the mechanism of drug transport into the brain can be classified in two ways, namely, intracellular drug transport and extracellular drug transport.
Intracellular drug delivery is the intraneuronal route of drug transport.
This route of transport is relatively slow and takes around 24 h to reach from the nasal cavity to brain cells
After entering the nasal cavity, exploiting the mechanism of endocytosis, the drugs could move to olfactory sensory neurons and peripheral trigeminal neurons via the olfactory and respiratory epithelium, respectively.
Further from nerve cells, intracellular and transcellular transports mediate the movement of drug to different parts of the brain.
The intracellular route delivers the drug to the olfactory lobe from the olfactory nerve and to the brain stem from trigeminal nerves.
At the same time, the transcellular route provides the drug to the lamina propria, which further enters the brain through different ways.
This type of transport facilitates the delivery of those drugs coated with lipophilic molecules that can adopt the passive diffusion or active transport/receptor-mediated transcytosis
Extracellular transport facilitates the transport of hydrophilic drug substances, various proteins, and peptides.
This is the sharp route of drug delivery from the nose to the brain and it is further divided into slow and fast extracellular transport.
Extracellular transport of drug is the fastest route of drug delivery from the nose to the brain.
In this route, drug molecules use the intercellular clefts in the olfactory and respiratory epithelium and extracellular transport along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathway to reach the spinal fluid and brain.
Once the drug reaches the lamina propria, there are different options including (i) getting into systemic circulation via being absorbed in olfactory blood vessels, (ii) it may enter nasal lymphatic vessels, (iii) or it may enter the cranial compartment associated with olfactory nerve bundles by extracellular diffusion
The challenges encountered in this route are mostly associated with the physicochemical properties of drugs, including molecular weight, lipophilicity, characteristics of the drug formulation, and the presence of specific receptors on the mentioned routes
The drug in the nasal route may be eliminated by mucociliary clearance or through CSF into blood
It is also reported that the surface charge, type, and concentration of the nanomedicine carrier also influence the drug delivery to the brain
In other limitations, sometimes due to the nature of the NPs used, e.g., phospholipid complexes target inflammatory sites and the reticuloendothelial system by themselves
Some other functionalized NPs tend to adsorb an arbitrary biological entity and form a protein sheath, referred to as a "protein corona, " which leads to the non-targeted interaction of drugs and also random deposits/accumulation of the carrier substance in biological systems
In order to achieve a sufficient therapeutic level in the target region of human brain, there has been a continuous struggle to improve the uptake of those drug-encapsulated nanocarriers and to explore the safest transport mechanisms after absorption.
Various pathways for the delivery of therapeutic moieties from the nasal route to the brain are illustrated in Figure

NANOMEDICINES: A PROMISING APPROACH FOR DRUG DELIVERY THROUGH BBB
For the safe and effective delivery of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved (FDA, 2019), commercially available drugs, several small-sized nanocarriers have been adopted to cure brain illnesses including brain cancer and AD.
These nanocarriers with specific drugs belong to nanomedicines.
While there is no cure for AD, Figure
The current anti-AD drugs can improve the clinical symptoms rather reversing or preventing the progression of the disease.
To deliver these recommended drugs to the affected part of the AD brain, NP-functionalized nanomedicine is considered as the most useful applicable approach.
Nanomedicines have a set of unique properties that enable them to deliver the anti-AD drugs at target sites in the brain.
Nanomedicines have the advantages of reduced dimensions and increased biocompatibility that facilitate easy transport of therapeutic substances into the brain
Small-size (approximately 100-10,000 times smaller than a human cell) nanomedicines can easily interact with the proteins and molecules on the cell surface as well as inside the cell
NP-functionalized nanomedicines have central core structures that ensure the encapsulation or conjugation of drugs and provide the protection and prolonged circulation in the blood
Nanomedicines are also specialized to target cells or even an intracellular compartment like Aβ in cells and thus can deliver the drug at a predetermined dosage directly to the pathological site
Nanomedicines can minimize the dose and frequency and then improve patient compliance
Regardless of some clinical issues, nanomedicines have potential advantages of favorability to the brain, greater stability, biocompatibility and biodegradability, protection from enzymatic degradation, increased half-life, improved bioavailability, and controlled release over other conventional ways of drug delivery to the brain to cure AD

NANOMEDICINES TO MANAGE AD
Nanomaterials are being widely explored to manage the pathologies of AD.
The following sections describe how nanostructure-based delivery systems are being employed for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
Table
Here, we present an updated view of nanomedicines as nanocarriers for delivering therapeutic moieties.

Organic Nanostructures

A special nanocarrier system of alginate-chitosan NPs can act as an excellent transporter to deliver the SpBMP-9, a short peptide derived from bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-9), across the BBB to AD brain.
SpBMP-9 is known as a candidate drug for AD for its function in promoting the differentiation of cholinergic neurons and inhibiting GSK3β
Similarly, with the delivery of another AD drug, Perlerin, CS-NPs have shown significant effective results with no brain toxicity and improved cognitive skills in AD Wistar rats
Trimethyl chitosan-PLGA NPs provide excellent transport of coenzyme Q10 into the brain of transgenic mice where it protects the brain from AD pathologies
Curcumin is a naturally occurring antioxidant with low toxic nature and a free radical scavenger phytochemical
Curcumin provision to brain against tau protein aggregation in AD is considered the most attractive approach in AD treatment where it binds with tau protein-based amyloid and shows antiamyloid properties in the micromolar concentration range
Furthermore, there is an inhibitive effect of curcumin on the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins
Curcumin delivery to the brain faces the issues of poor stability and bioavailability that lead to less brain uptake
To deal with these issues, use of nanocarriers is preferred due to its safety, as well as higher and prolonged exposure to the brain.
Various specialized NPs have been designed that encapsulate the curcumin and deliver it to the brain via transcytosis across the BBBs.
Due to the friendly nature of the biological system, use of PLGA NPs is a common practice.
Curcumin loaded with PLGA NPs can permeate through the BBB and reach the AD regions where it shows protective effect against the beta amyloid accumulation
A stabilized and sustained curcumin delivery across the BBB is also achieved by using a nanoemulsion of red blood cell membranecoated PLGA particles with embedded T807 molecules on the red blood cell membrane surface (T807/RPCNP) loaded with curcumin.
Mutual effects of T807, 807/RPCNP exhibit strong inhibitory effects against tau-associated pathogenesis
In another study, hydroxypropylcyclodextrin-encapsulated curcumin complexes (CUR/HP-CD inclusion complexes) emulsion shows greater cellular uptake of curcumin across the BBB and can be considered as a better carrier system to deliver curcumin to the brain for AD therapy
Furthermore, curcumin loaded with chitosan and bovine serum albumin NPs increase the drug permeation and accelerate the phagocytosis of the Aβ peptide to relieve AD symptoms

Moreover, the multi-target nano-system displayed the highest antioxidant activity with no toxicity and significant inhibition of brain AChE.

Burilova et al., 2020
DTNPs Dopamine Intra-ventricular 140 nm Dopamine and tryptophan have been known to exhibit excellent anti-aggregation properties, neuroprotective effects, and anti-amyloid and fibril disaggregation activity, along with inherent fluorescent property.
Tryptophan can cross the BBB via LAT1, thus, its presence in the nano-system can facilitate the delivery system to cross the BBB efficiently.
In vitro and in vivo investigations displayed the neuroprotective effects in neuroblastoma cells and anti-aggregation efficacy of DTNPs in both FF derived amyloid fibrils and preformed Aβ-peptide fiber, along with improved cognitive impairment in ICV-STZ induced animal model of dementia.

Liposomes
The nanosized vesicular liposomes possess self-assembling and amphiphilic properties and have been extensively used as nanocarriers to deliver drugs to brain tissues
Liposomes can be readily functionalized and surface modulated using several polyether, functional proteins and cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) that aid in target-specific drug transport across the BBB
For instance, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated liposomes are reported to successfully evade the opsonization of RES.
In addition, glutathione-PEGylated liposomes are also reported to efficiently enhance the cellular uptake of the drug across endothelial BBB
Curcumin-loaded liposomes can significantly enhance the delivery of drugs to CNS via corresponding receptors on BBB cells
To deliver apolipoprotein E (ApoE 2 ) in AD brain, the liposome carrier system altered with surface containing mannose ligand and CPPs have been applied.
The results indicate that functionalized liposomes are safe and compitable and can deliver substantial concentration of genes to the target tissues in AD therapy
Due to the protective effects for hippocampus neurons and anti-Aβ properties, osthole (Ost) is considered as an anti-AD compound.
An Ost-liposomes carrier system has been developed for its bioavailability and the exposure to target sites in the AD mice brain

Niosomes
Administration of a niosome-lipid nanocarrier system loaded with artemisia-absinthium against amyloid aggregation shows significant effects on AD pathologies.
Thus, the formulation can be used to preclude the development of amyloid for AD therapy
In order to enhance the drug exposure to AD brain via the intranasal route, pentamide-loaded chitosan glutamate-coated niosomes have been developed.
The results exhibit a significant increase in pentamide efficacy across the BBB
Low blood level of folates is considered as the primary cause of AD.
To deal with the hindrance of folic acid transport across the BBB, formulation with different concentrations of folic acid-niosomes has been prepared.

It is a self-assembled lipid-modified starch hybrid system.
A study demonstrates that intranasal administration of curcumin loaded in amylolipid nanovesicles has greater tendency to cross the BBB and shows significant effect against AD pathologies.
Thus, the findings prove that this carrier system is a promising carrier for drug delivery to AD brain tissues

Metallic NPs
In nanomedicine-based approaches to AD, the use of metallic NPs is considered a potential research area for targeted drug delivery across the BBB.
Due to the utilization of chemistry-based techniques in their synthesis, metallic NPs have some limitations, but some of the metallic NPs like cerium, selenium, gold, and iron are known to exhibit significant anti-AD properties.
Currently, researchers are oriented toward the use of green chemistry-based approaches for designing biologically friendly NPs.

Selenium NPs
As aforementioned, reducing ROS level in the brain is a key strategy to relieve AD.
There are many trace elements such as selenium (II), sodium selenite (VI), and sodium selenite (IV) known as active ROS inhibitors.
Being important micronutrients of the human body and gifted with biomedical application of selenium nanoformulation, selenium-and selenite-containing NPs play roles in lowering the oxidative stress and inhibiting the cytotoxicity of cells.
Therefore, they have the potential to be used in curing neurodegenerative diseases like AD
It has been found that the modified selenium NPs with sialic acid can cross the BBB and their exposure can inhibit the Aβ aggregation reactions
Similarly, sialic acid-modified selenium NPs coated with high BBB permeability peptide-B6 and epigallocation-3gallate (EGCG) could inhibit the Aβ aggregation

Cerium NPs
Cerium oxide NPs could protect vital neuronal function against high ROS levels in an AD patient.
It has been evaluated that CeONPs have no negative effects and are extremely useful for the treatment of AD.

Furthermore, the iron oxide NP formulations may possess potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD

NP-Chelation-Based AD Therapy
A major pathology in AD is neuronal degeneration, and it has been found that oxidative stress is one of the leading risk factors that initiate and promote neurodegeneration.
Compared to normal brain, AD brain shows the dysregulation of metal level, such as iron, aluminum, zinc, and copper, which may facilitate oxidative stress, toxic radical formation, and disruption in DNA functioning, and mediate the onset of AD symptoms
To deal with the metal accumulation and their resultant oxidative stress in the brain, nanotechnology contributes effectively to the form of chelation therapy in the inhibition of oxidative stress.
To reduce the levels of corresponding metals in AD brain, NPs of Fe and Cu metals in the form of chelators have been employed.
These chelators are designed to be safe in delivery and have minimal neurotoxicity to healthy brain tissues
Chelation therapy shows significant effects on the solubilization of Aβ plaques in AD brain.
In metal chelation, copper is the most vital trace element and 54 copper binding proteins have been found in human proteomes
It has been found that copper ions are involved in the modulation of the expression of amyloid precursor proteins, and their chelators can reduce Aβ accumulation up to 50% in AD transgenic mice.
The Cu-conjugated NP formulation in the form of chelator clioquinol (CQ) has the potential to reverse the metal precipitation of amyloid protein in AD patients
NP-chelator conjugates exhibit inhibitory effects against Aβ aggregation and protect neurons from neurotoxicity without affecting their proliferation

AuNPs play a promising role in diagnosing the AD both in bare form and in conjugation with other compounds.
Based on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characters, AuNP exposure can relieve the brain damage in the AD model
AuNPs in combination with reduced graphene or coated with anti-tau antibodies can act as neuro-probes and detect the Tau-441 target proteins both in serum fluid and cerebrospinal fluid
AuNPs conjugated with Co 2+ can be used to investigate the Aβ peptides' aggregation kinetics and their self-assembly stages in MRI images
In the diagnosis of AD pathologies, AuNPs follow the biosensory strategies.
For example, AuNPs are used in the development of an electrochemical immunosensor to detect the tau proteins
Furthermore, it has been found that chiral recognition of stable AuNPs could enhance their ability to prevent Aβ aggregation

Protein-Coated NPs
In biomedical sciences, the usage of protein-coated NPs in multifunctional therapeutic approaches has great importance in the treatment of AD
It has been shown that serum albumin (SA)-NP formulation increases the efficacy of R-flurbiprofen (an anti-AD drug) in reducing Aβ peptide toxicity in the brain
Similar to R-flurbiprofen, SA-NPs are also used in the transport of tacrine and can stabilize the bioavailability with minimum hepatotoxicity
In addition, the NPs coupled with BSA and sialic acid have been used to detect the early Aβ formation in the onset of AD
Furthermore, delivered protein-based NPs serve as contrast agents in the brain and facilitate in providing better imaging to study the Aβ plaques

Antibody (Ab)-Decorated NPs
To cure AD, delivering immunotherapy doses against amyloid bodies imposes serious side effects in the form of meningoencephalitis
To minimize the side effects of immunotherapy, the usage of NPs coated with antibodies for specific target proteins can be the best alternative to detect and dissolve the protein aggregations in brain cells.
Using the secondary ion mass spectrometry, antibodies coated with metal oxide NPs are adopted for the imaging of AD-associated proteins in the brain
Chitosan-based smart nano-vehicles coated with modified Ab fragments have been used to target the Aβ amyloids in AD cells.
For greater uptakes across BBB and better diagnostic approach, NP-Ab formulation is coupled with contrast agents such as FITC and Alexa Fluor
Superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs conjugated with Aβ oligomer-specific scFv-AbW20 and class A scavenger receptor activator XD4 (W20/XD4-SPIONs) exhibit promising results in the therapeutic benefits for AD
In another study, multifunctional superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs conjugated with Aβ oligomer-specific scFv-antibody and class A scavenger receptor activator show promising early diagnostic potential for AD
PEG-NPs coated with specific Abs are used to degrade Aβ-42
Decorating the PLGA NPs surface with 83-14 monoclonal Ab could effectively reduce the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ fibrils in AD brain

CONCLUSION REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
This review has provided an outlook of the recent advances in nanomedicines employed to cure AD.
Considering the ultimate goals of nanomedicines, much advancement will be achieved in the treatment of AD.
The nanomedicines have tailored and transformed both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for AD.
For the promising future of nanomedicines used in AD, we suggest the revision of the current practices to consider the neglected factors at the nano-bio interface in order to minimize the risk of misinterpretations of the outcomes.
Furthermore, the adoption of multipurpose NPs with multi-therapeutic capacities (e.g., delivering a variety of therapeutic moieties to manage inflammation, tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunctionality) is also recommended.
Moreover, the challenges in the large-scale production of reproducible NPs need to be addressed.
Considering the key targets of the current drugs involving tau proteins, neuroinflammation, and Aβ proteins, there is an urgent need to develop the drugs with new targets that can not only treat the symptoms but also prevent the progression of the disease at an early stage, which can ultimately lead to a better quality of life.
