Cubeben induces autophagy via PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway to protect primary neurons against amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease
Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative process by which it recycles cytosolic components and degrades protein aggregates inside cells.
Here, we identified cubeben as an inducer of autophagy in primary neuronal cells.
Autophagy induction was accompanied the upregulation of autophagic proteins like Beclin, ATG5, ATG12 and lipidation of LC3-II in primary neuronal cells.
Cubeben induces autophagy by the inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway in a dose dependent manner.
Constitutive active P110a abrogates cubeben induced autophagic induction in primary neuronal cells.
Furthermore, cubeben inhibits amyloid beta induced toxicity in primary neuronal cells.
Thus our data suggests that cubeben as a potential anti-Alzheimer therapeutic lead.

Introduction
Autophagy is a lysosomal mediated degradation of protein aggregates and is involved in the recycling of cytosolic components inside the cells
The cellular function of cell especially neuronal survival and growth of dendrites is regulated by autophagy
Autophagy clears intracellular and extracellular amyloid beta from AD brain
Several reports suggest that defects in autophagy are linked with the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease
Slowdown of autophagy leads the accumulation of amyloid beta and tauopathy which leads to the destruction of neurons
It has been reported that genetic level of Beclin 1 is low in AD brain that tends to slow down of autophagy
Moreover, slowdown of autophagy leads the accumulation of amyloid beta and neurodegeneration in transgenic mouse model of AD disease
In transgenic mouse model it has been established that autophagy helps in the secretion of amyloid beta while as autophagic defects leads to the accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta
Several studies have shown that pharmacological intervention leads to reduction in accumulation of amyloid beta and maintains the neuronal health.
It has been shown that rapamycin induces autophagy, clears amyloid beta and provides neuroprotection in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease
Keeping this in view, we have tested cubeben for autophagic induction in primary neuronal cells.
Moreover, cubeben induces autophagy in a concentration dependent manner for 24 h.
Induction of autophagy by cubeben protects the neurons against amyloid beta toxicity in primary neuronal cells.
Interestingly, cubeben induced autophagy through inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway.
Upregulation of P110a abrogates cubeben induced effect on PI3K-AKT pathway in primary neuronal cells.
Surprisingly, cubeben protects neurons against amyloid beta toxicity in primary neuronal cells.
Overall, in this study we demonstrated that cubeben induced autophagy through the inhibition of PI3K-AKT pathway and protects neurons against amyloid beta toxicity.

Results

Cubeben induces autophagy in primary neuronal cells without toxicity
In order to evaluate the autophagy potential of cubeben in primary neuronal cells, the primary neuronal cells were checked for the expression of neuronal marker (Map2c) before each experiment (Fig.
Western blotting revealed that the expression of LC3-II was increased by cubeben treated primary neurons through concentration dependent manner as compared with control.
The expression of adopter protein P62 was also decreased in a concentration dependent manner (Fig.
We further checked the toxicity of cubeben at 5 lM, 10 lM and 20 lM concentrations in primary neuronal cells.
Interestingly cubeben was non-toxic up to 20 lM compared with control group for 24 h in primary neuronal cells (Fig.

Cubeben inhibits PI3K-AKT pathway to induce autophagy in primary neuronal cells
The various autophagic proteins like Beclin, ATG5 and ATG12 were up regulatedby cubeben at a concentration dependent manner (5 lM, 10 lM and 20 lM) for 24 h (Fig.
In order to investigate the mechanism of autophagy induction through mTOR, we have analysed the expression level of AKT.
Interestingly, the phosphorylation of p-AKT (Ser 473) and Thr 308 was downregulated by cubeben in a concentration dependent manner as compared to untreated cells.
Moreover, the expression of p110a was also inhibited in a dose dependent manner, suggesting that cubeben inhibits PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by the down regulation of P110a expression (Fig.
Thus our results clearly indicated that cubeben induces autophagy through PI3K AKT pathway.

Upregulation of pCAG-Myr-p110-IH abolishes cubeben effect on PI3K-AKT pathway in primary neuronal cells
In order to validate the mechanism of cubeben, we have transfected the primary neuronal cells with pCAG-Myr-p110-IH overexpression plasmid.
The p110a overexpressed cells hampers the cubeben induced inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR in a concentration dependent manner.
Interestingly, the expression of autophagy proteins like ATG5 and ATG12 and LC3-I in pCAG-Myr-p110-IH overexpressed cells treated with cubeben remains unchanged compared with untreated cells (Fig.
The overexpression of pCAG-Myr-p110-IH compared with control was checked by western blot (Fig.

Morphological observations in primary neuronal cells
The protective effect of cubeben was confirmed by morphological observation using phase contrast microscope.
Primary neuronal cells treated with 20 lM of amyloid beta displayed altered neuronal out-growth and dendrite network which leads to floating of cells indicating cytotoxicity (Fig.
Furthermore, treatment with cubeben at a concentration of 5, 10 and 20 lM showed improved neuronal outgrowth and intact neuritis formation.
Moreover, cells treated with desired concentrations of cubeben showed healthy morphology which was attenuated by amyloid beta (Fig.

Discussion
Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease which happens in an old age
Accumulation of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylation of tau is the main pathological feature of AD
Amyloid beta is cleared from the brain by various mechanism viz.
blood brain clearance, interstitial fluid bulk-flow clearance, perivascular system, paravascular system, autophagy lysosomal degradation, etc.
Amyloid beta stay normal in healthy volunteers but its clearance is decreased that leads to the accumulation of amyloid beta which triggers cell death
Autophagy plays a vital role in clearance of amyloid beta and provides the neuronal plasticity
Therefore, we have planned to explore the possibility of cubeben as an inducer of autophagy.
Cubeben inhibits cell proliferation of vascular smooth muscles by inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) which abrogates cardiovascular symptoms
However, we are exploring for the first time that cubeben induces autophagy in primary neuronal cells and cubeben was nontoxic up to 20 lM for 24 h.
Autophagy is a cellular lysosomal degradation 4 Cubeben reverts morphological change in primary neuronal cells.
Amyloid beta at a concentration of 20 lM damages primary neuronal cells which were retained by cubeben in a concentration dependent manner pathway which involves multistage process to recycle components and amyloid beta degradation
With this view, we have established molecular of cubeben in a concentration dependent manner.
We further analysed the autophagic proteins, surprisingly Beclin, ATG5 and ATG12 were unregulated in a concentration dependent manner for 24 h in primary neuronal cells.
We have further focused mTOR a major autophagy inducer
Interestingly, cubeben inhibits mTOR in a concentration dependent manner.
Further the upstream proteins like pAKT (ser473) and pAKT (T308) was also inhibited.
This made us believe that cubeben inhibits P110a in a dose dependent manner for 24 h in primary neuronal cells.
To further validate cubeben inhibits P110a, we have overexpressed primary neuronal cells by pCAG-Myr-p110-IH that remains constitutive active.
Cubeben was unable to inhibit P110a which leads to the activation of pAKT (ser473), pAKT (T308) and mTOR.
Activation of this PI3K-AKT pathway inhibits autophagy as the lipidation of LC3 does not take place moreover ATG5 and ATG12 expression remains same in cubeben treated primary neuronal cells.
Amyloid beta is known to induce cell death by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential loss and increase in reactive oxygen species
Interestingly, autophagy induction by cubeben protects primary neuronal cells against amyloid beta toxicity in primary neuronal cells.
In conclusion, we have explored the potential of cubeben on autophagy and established a molecular mechanism of cubeben in primary neuronal cells.
We have also demonstrated that cubeben protects the neuronal heath through autophagy.
Cubeben can be further investigated as a therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
