Regional Amyloid-β Load and White Matter Abnormalities Contribute to Hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s Dementia
We investigated the association between amyloid-β deposition and white matter (WM) integrity as a determinant of brain glucose hypometabolism across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum.
We assessed ninety-six subjects (27 cognitively normal, 49 mild cognitive impairment, and 20 AD dementia) who underwent [ 18 F]FDG and [ 18 F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging.
Among the regions with reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the AD group, we selected a voxel of interest in the angular bundle bilaterally for subsequent analyses.
Using voxel-based interaction models at voxel level, we tested whether the regional hypometabolism is associated with FA in the angular bundle and regional amyloid-β deposition.
In the AD patients, [ 18 F]FDG hypometabolism in the striatum, mesiobasal temporal, orbitofrontal, precuneus, and cingulate cortices were associated with the interaction between high levels of [ 18 F]Florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) in these regions and low FA in the angular bundle.
We found that the interaction between, rather than the independent effects of, high levels of amyloid-β deposition and WM integrity disruption determined limbic hypometabolism in patients with AD.
This finding highlights a more integrative model for AD, where the interaction between partially independent processes determines the glucose hypometabolism.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia worldwide
AD pathophysiology has been conceptualized as a cascade of sequential events triggered by amyloid-β deposition, followed by downstream events such as tau hyperphosphorylation, glucose hypometabolism, and eventually dementia
However, the lack of a strong association between amyloid-β deposition and cognitive and synaptic dysfunctions has questioned whether amyloid-β deposition is a sufficient condition to trigger AD progression
Indeed, recent studies have suggested that the synergistic interaction between, rather than the sequential effects of, pathological pathways such as amyloid-β and tau is the key element associated with the pathophysiological progression of AD
Since the original description, AD has been characterized as a gray matter disease
contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
amyloidosis and tau accumulation underlie most neurobiological processes
However, the disconnection of fiber bundles has also been reported from the early stages of the disease
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that assesses WM organization and microstructure through fractional anisotropy (FA)
In AD, WM tracts in the limbic system have shown reduced FA, suggesting loss of axons and myelin, and hence impairment in connectivity
The pathological processes underlying such changes are still undetermined, although both Wallerian degeneration secondary to cortical neuronal loss and retrogenesis with primary axonal damage and myelin breakdown may contribute
[ 18 F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F]FDG) and [ 18 F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) measure cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid-β deposition, respectively
Studies in non-human primates have shed light on the relationship between WM disconnectivity and cerebral glucose metabolism in AD, showing that neurotoxic lesions in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices lead to neocortical and hippocampal hypometabolism
Subsequent human studies have correlated abnormalities in topographically related tracts to hypometabolic regions (for example, fornix FA abnormalities, and posterior cingulate cortex hypometabolism), suggesting that the progression of cerebral hypometabolism temporally follows amyloid-β deposition
Such background information leaves it open whether and how these two, at least, partially independent pathophysiological processes-WM abnormalities and β-amyloid deposition-interact to determine AD progression.
Here, in a cross-sectional study, we tested the hypothesis that [ 18 F]FDG uptake reduction in limbic regions depends upon t h e i n t e r a c t i o n b e t w e e n a m y l o i d -β d e p o s i t i o n ([ 18 F]Florbetapir PET SUVR) and WM integrity (FA), rather than their separated effects.

Methods

Database Description
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, phases ADNIGO and ADNI2 (adni.loni.usc.edu).
ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD.
The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and clinical assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD.

Study Participants
For the present study, we only included ADNI participants who had [ 18 F]Florbetapir, [ 18 F]FDG, and DTI acquisitions at same visit.
Cognitively normal (CN) individuals had a minimental state examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. MCIs had a MMSE score equal to or greater than 24, a CDR of 0.5, subjective and objective memory deficits, and essentially normal activities of daily living.
AD patients had a MMSE score lower or equal 26, CDR higher than 0.5, and met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD
All individuals had absence of any other neuropsychiatric disorders.
Importantly, the ADNI study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of each participating site and was conducted in accordance with Federal Regulations, the Internal Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and good clinical practices (GCP).
The ADNI Research Committee has approved all the protocols used in the study.
The study subjects provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment for imaging and completed questionnaires that were approved by each participating site's IRB.
Further information regarding the ADNI inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in detail at www. adni-info.org
[accessed November 2016].

DTI Methods
The images were acquired conforming ADNI protocols (www.adni-info.org[accessed
November 2016]).
Briefly, all diffusion images were scanned on 3 Tesla (3 T) GE Medical Systems scanners.
Scans comprised of 41 diffusion encoding and five resting (b0) directions.
A voxel size of 1.4 mm × 1.4 mm × 2.7 mm and b = 1000 s/mm 2 was used.
All scans used in this study were corrected for EPI current.
T1 scans were acquired on the same GE 3 T scanner with a 1.2 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm voxel size.
Further acquisition details are available from ADNI website (ADNI-INFO.
org).
After processing the DTIs, FA maps were generated using FSL-DTIFIT from the skull-stripped eddy current corrected images in the native MRI space (Fig.
A statistical comparison of voxel-wise FA values was performed to identify the differences between each diagnostic group (Fig.
The anatomical WM bundles have been identified by the MRI Atlas of human white matter.
For the subsequent analysis, the angular bundle was defined a prior, since it is a well-defined tract related to AD dementia, which directly connects the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex.
A voxelof-interest (VOI) was obtained from the angular bundle bilaterally and was used to extract FA values from each subject (see supplementary information).

PET Methods
PET images were acquired following the ADNI acquisition protocols (
accessed in January 2016).
Imaging analysis methods are summarized in Fig.
In summary, during the preprocessing stage, the acquired images were blurred to match a common point spread function of 8-mm fullwidth half-maximum Gaussian kernel, aligned to the AC-PC line, and resampled to achieve a common uniform resolution.
Subsequently, in the post-processing stage, the images underwent non-linear spatial normalization to the MNI 152 template space using the transformation derived from the automatic PET/T1-MRI transformation and anatomical MRI registration for each subject.
Voxel-wise standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were generated for [ 18 F]Florbetapir and [ 18 F]FDG using the cerebellum gray matter/global white matter and pons as the reference regions, respectively.
A global PET SUVR value for each subject was estimated using a composite of the precuneus, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortices.

Statistical Methods
The analyses were performed using Matlab® (
accessed November 2016) with a novel computational platform developed to perform complex voxel-wise statistical operations, such as interaction models, with different imaging modalities
First, we compared the FA between CN and AD groups and identified clusters of FA reduction in the bilateral angular bundle and the fornix (Fig.
After correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate at p < 0.05), we extracted the FA values in VOIs in bilateral angular bundles for the subsequent analyses.
To evaluate whether the interaction between WM abnormalities (FA in bilateral angular bundle) and amyloid-β deposition ([ 18 F]Florbetapir SUVR at every voxel) determines the regional hypometabolism, we used the following statistical model: The model was adjusted for Hachinski score
The statistical parametric maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate at p < 0.05

Results
Demographic features are summarized in Table
The CN group has [ 18
Patients with AD had significantly reduced FAs in the angular bundle bilaterally and in the fornix compared to CN (P < 0.05) (Fig.
Since WM abnormalities on the angular bundle were related to a diagnosis of AD dementia, a VOI was defined in this region for the subsequent analysis.
Importantly, the three diagnostic groups showed distinct averaged FA values in In the AD group, a voxel-based analysis revealed that [ 18 F]FDG hypometabolism in the striatum, basal and mesial temporal, orbitofrontal, precuneus, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortices were driven by the interaction between high levels of [ 18 F]Florbetapir uptake in these regions and low FA in the angular bundle (Fig.
Moreover, the laterality of the angular bundle VOI was associated with distinct patterns of regional hypometabolism.
The interaction of RAB disconnections with amyloid-β deposition was associated with [ 18 F]FDG hypometabolism in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (Fig.
Notably, this interaction was not found in the CN and MCI groups.

Discussion
We showed that the interaction between amyloid-β accumulation and reduction in the angular bundle is significantly associated with hypometabolism in limbic regions in patients with AD dementia.
Overall, this finding is in agreement with an integrative framework proposing that the co-occurrence of different pathophysiological processes potentiates neurodegeneration and clinical progression in AD
As previously shown, we found decreased FA values in WM tracts associated with the memory system, including the angular bundle and the fornix
Microstructural WM damage disrupts connections to cortical areas, as observed in regional changes in the parahippocampal WM, leading to mesial temporal lobe deafferentation
Most abnormalities are found in temporal lobe regions, with frequent targets in the retrogenesis model of WM impairment in AD.
Previous reports have shown associations between reduced FA and both regional glucose hypometabolism, particularly of the posterior cingulate cortex, and the volume of the descending cingulum
The hippocampal atrophy, also a neurodegenerative radiological feature of AD, has been also related with decreased FA
The posterior cingulate cortex metabolism was also inversely related to diffusivity increase in the hippocampus
Assessing the temporal relationship between biomarkers, Villain and colleagues posit that hippocampal atrophy leads to the disruption of the cingulum bundle and cingulate fasciculus, with subsequent glucose hypometabolism in these areas
Whereas biomarkers of neurodegeneration and WM disruption have been previously correlated, similar findings have not been observed in regard to amyloid-β deposition PET imaging in pre-dementia subjects
In our interaction study, we found hypometabolic areas related to angular bundle abnormalities and also to amyloid-β deposition in the AD group.
Interestingly, these regions are described in Braak's neuropathological stages B and C involving isocortex association areas, in patients with significant clinical decline
These findings suggest a possible increase metabolic vulnerability to the interaction of the posterior limbic structures in the right non-dominant hemisphere, and in the anterior and basal nuclei areas in the dominant left hemisphere.
The relationship between CSF biomarkers (Aβ 1-42 and p-Tau181) and WM integrity has been studied in CN adults, and a positive correlation was found between the Aβ 1-42 /p-Tau181 ratio and FA in the fornix, corpus callosum, and inferior, superior, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
Furthermore, significantly, reduced FA in the left posterior cingulum was observed in patients with pathological CSF total tau levels
In fact, decreased FA has been reported in frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies
Interestingly, amyloid PET positive asymptomatic subjects have been shown to display increased FA, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in very early stages of the disease by glial response and axonal pruning at regions of crossing fibers
We speculate that the latter mechanism may explain the non-significant results observed in our CN and patients.
Further studies with a larger number asymptomatic and MCI subjects, with enriched tau status subjects, may help to elucidate these questions and capture group differences.
Importantly, previous studies did not observe strong associations between regional amyloid-β deposition and glucose hypometabolism in AD patients
Here, we have shown that the interaction with white matter integrity disruption is the key element linking regional glucose hypometabolism and amyloid pathology in the dementia phase of AD.
Integrating distinct modalities may foster a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying AD progression, beyond the role of individual biomarkers.
It has been shown that amyloid status combined with CSF tau levels, and also with baseline cerebral metabolic decline, predicts conversion to dementia in patients with MCI
Therefore, integrative biomarker studies may offer a new avenue to evaluate individual risks of progression along the cognitive continuum of aging.
Specifically, since the interaction with WM disruption is the key element linking amyloid-β and pathophysiological progression in AD, we may argue that our results suggest that the use of biomarkers of WM integrity could help to identify those fated to develop dementia symptoms among MCIs with amyloid-β pathology.
The major methodological strength of our study is the use of only continuous biomarker values.
Biomarkers occur on a continuum; therefore, dichotomization techniques are invariably subject to analytical and methodological idiosyncrasies.
Some methodological issues limit the interpretation of our results.
The cross-sectional analysis prevents inferences on the progression of WM abnormalities, amyloid deposition, and glucose metabolism.
It is also important to highlight that FDG SUVR measurement is sensitive to several biological factors such as blood glucose levels, physical, and synaptic activity.
Also, because patients had to have performed the complete imaging protocol, we included a relatively small number of AD subjects, and thus our main findings need confirmation in larger samples.
Despite the limited number of subjects, in order to avoid potential confounding effects, we performed all the statistical analyses including covariates that could impact the results, as age, gender, vascular WM load, education, and APOE ε4 status.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our results show that combining glucose metabolism, amyloid-β, and WM integrity in relevant brain regions offers the encouraging possibility to assess different pathological processes in the same patient at the same time.
More importantly, the integration of different biomarkers in sophisticated statistical models may help clarify the pathological alterations observed along the AD spectrum.

Conclusion
In sum, the major result of our study demonstrates a strong association amyloid-β deposition and glucose hypometabolism through synergistic interaction with white matter disruption.
These results support a more integrative model for AD progression, that the convergence of partially independent pathological pathways drives disease progression.
These findings provide novel insights in AD pathophysiology framework by suggesting that future disease-modifying therapies using [ 18 F]FDG as a biomarker for efficacy should integrate measures of white matter integrity in order to better interpret the therapeutic effects of the intervention.
