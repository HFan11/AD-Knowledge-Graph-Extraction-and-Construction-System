Human iPSC-Derived Hippocampal Spheroids: An Innovative Tool for Stratifying Alzheimer Disease Patient-Specific Cellular Phenotypes and Developing Therapies
The hippocampus is important for memory formation and is severely affected in the brain with Alzheimer disease (AD).
Our understanding of early pathogenic processes occurring in hippocampi in AD is limited due to tissue unavailability.
Here, we report a chemical approach to rapidly generate free-floating hippocampal spheroids (HSs), from human induced pluripotent stem cells.
When used to model AD, both APP and atypical PS1 variant HSs displayed increased Ab42/Ab40 peptide ratios and decreased synaptic protein levels, which are common features of AD.
However, the two variants differed in tau hyperphosphorylation, protein aggregation, and protein network alterations.
NeuroD1-mediated gene therapy in HSs-derived progenitors resulted in modulation of expression of numerous genes, including those involved in synaptic transmission.
Thus, HSs can be harnessed to unravel the mechanisms underlying early pathogenic changes in the hippocampi of AD patients, and provide a robust platform for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting early stage AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, resulting in memory impairments and cognitive decline, and eventually leading to significant disability.
Despite decades of intensive research, AD still remains incurable and represents a major clinical, social and economic problem (
The hippocampus is involved in the formation of new memories, learning, and emotions, and is one of the first regions of the brain that atrophies in AD
However, since human brain tissue is generally available only postmortem, our understanding of early pathogenic events occurring in the hippocampus, specifically at the cellular level, is limited to brain imaging techniques
Hence, it is difficult to identify the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in AD.
Transgenic rodents are commonly used as an experimental model of AD for preclinical investigation
However, all therapies that were successful in rodent models have failed in human clinical trials, questioning whether rodent AD models are appropriate for modeling human AD
Therefore, to develop efficient therapies for AD, we need to develop advanced models for preclinical investigations.
These models should closely recapitulate human AD pathology, and allow investigation of early cellular changes, to identify druggable targets that could delay disease onset, and eventually overcome memory impairment.
Even if minimalist, the models should mimic the human brain parenchyma and allow 3D interaction between mature cell types
Such models should be inexhaustible and scalable to provide enough material for different assays, including omics analyses.
They should also be useful to develop therapeutic strategies.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harboring the genetic background of the patient they are derived from, are an attractive source of human material that can be used to generate physiologically relevant models for studying neurological diseases, including AD
Given the crucial role played by the hippocampus in AD, the development of human iPSC-based hippocampal cellular models would be an important step forward for AD research.
Here, we describe an innovative strategy allowing to differentiate human iPSCs into hippocampal spheroids (HSs), enriched in hippocampal neurons expressing the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 20 (ZBTB20) and the prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1)
The HSs generated from two AD patients carrying variations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 (PS1) genes exhibited cardinal cellular pathological features of AD, including loss of synaptic proteins and increased ratio of intracellular and extracellular Ab42/Ab40 peptides.
However, they also exhibited differences in protein aggregation measured by the non-destructive label-free Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy
Hippocampal neurons derived from APP variant HSs demonstrated profound transcriptomic alterations, which could be modulated by overexpression of NeuroD1 (ND1), resulting in the upregulation of genes, gene products of which are associated with synaptic transmission and are altered in AD (de

RESULTS

Generation and Characterization of HSs from iPSCs of AD Patients and Healthy Individuals
To investigate the effect of PS1 and APP variation in human hippocampal cells, we generated iPSC lines from the skin fibroblasts of two patients, one female and one male, diagnosed with genetic AD (Figure
The female patient carried a homozygous variation in the APP gene (APP p.V717I)
This variation, known as the AD London mutation, is the most common missense variation of the APP gene.
The male patient with atypical AD carried a rare variation in the PS1 gene (PS1 p.R278K)
In addition, we generated multiple iPSC lines from age-and gender-matched non-demented healthy individuals.
Next, we developed an original protocol (Figure
To generate dorsomedial telencephalic neural precursors, the EBs were simultaneously treated with dual smad signaling chemical inhibitors
Dickkopf-specific chemical agonist XAV-939
To specify the hippocampal identity, EBs were exposed to CHIR-99021, a chemical activator of WNT signaling
EBs aged 30 days in vitro (DIV) were almost exclusively composed of LEF1-positive cells (Figure
Quantitative analysis reveals that the EBs contained mainly neurons (Figure
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes represented less than 2% of the population, and O4-positive oligodendrocytes were absent (Figures
Importantly, 90% of the cells were positive for ZBTB20 and 45%-60% were positive for PROX1 (Figures
The cultures also contained PAX6-, TBR1-, calretinin-, and calbindin-positive cells
Few GABA-positive cells were identified (Figure
To validate our finding, we transplanted single-cell suspension from 50-day-old EBs of one of the iPSC control lines (CSC-37N) into the hippocampi of adult RAG-1-deficient mice and examined the graft composition 5 weeks later.
The grafted cells (human nuclei-positive) co-expressed ZBTB20 and PROX1 (Figure
When aged 100 DIV, the EBs were large in size, with no obvious alterations (Figure
Although they contained some GFAP-positive astrocytes, they were primarily composed by MAP2-positive neurons (Figure
They also contained TBR1 and an almost equal ratio of calretinin/calbindin-positive cells (Figure
Detailed analysis of EBs revealed the presence of pre-synaptic synaptophysin-positive puncta at the surface of MAP2/PROX1-positive neurons (Figure
We named these HSs, and further examined their relevance for modeling AD.
APP and PS1 Variant HSs Exhibit AD-Related Pathology At first, we measured the amount of extra-and intracellular Ab40 and Ab42 peptides present in 100 DIV HSs.
Both APP and PS1 variant HSs and their culture supernatants contained Ab peptides with a higher ratio of Ab42/Ab40 than control HSs (approximately 1.5-fold higher for PS1 variant and approximately 2-fold higher for APP variant; Figures
The change in Ab42/Ab40 ratio was mainly due to increased levels of Ab42 peptides (Figure
The levels of released and intracellular Ab40 peptide were either not altered (as in PS1 variant HSs) or showed a trend toward decreased production (APP variant HSs) (Figure
We also examined changes in levels of Ab38 peptide but found none (Figure
We next examined the state of phosphorylation of tau, previously reported to be enhanced by oligomeric Ab peptides
We performed western blotting, using the monoclonal antibody AT8, which recognizes phosphorylation of tau at both serine 202 and threonine 205
We found significantly higher levels of the 37-kDa phosphorylated tau protein isoform in APP variant HSs, as compared with gender-matched control HSs.
Since synaptic pathology is an early morphological change in the human AD postmortem brain
Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of the pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin and the post-synaptic protein drebrin (Figure

However, western blot analysis revealed that their abundance differed between AD and control samples, and levels of the two synaptic proteins were significantly decreased in both APP and PS1 variant HSs compared with their respective controls
We also examined if there was a change in levels of the post-synaptic protein PSD-95 but found none (Figures

APP Variant Hippocampal Neurons Exhibit Several Significant Alterations
To gain insights into possible alterations of young AD hippocampal neurons, we examined phosphorylation of tau, the morphometric characteristics and electrophysiological properties of neurons, and miRNA levels of expression in cultures at 56 DIV.
We found a higher proportion of AT8/ MAP2-positive neurons in APP, but not in PS1 variant cultures as compared with controls (Figures
Interestingly, the size of the soma, and the length and complexity of the neurites were altered only in APP variant neurons (Figures
Since morphometric characteristics can affect functional properties of neurons
Following somatic current injection, both AD and healthy hippocampal neurons were able to fire action potentials (APs) (Figure
However, APP but not PS1 variant hippocampal neurons generated significantly fewer APs, when compared with control hippocampal neurons (Figures
In addition, APs of APP variant neurons had a more depolarized threshold and lower amplitude (Figure
In line with these data, we observed that the amplitude of the TTX-sensitive inward sodium current was significantly reduced for APP but not PS1 variant hippocampal neurons when compared with controls (Figure
Because miRNAs play an important role in AD pathogenesis
miRNA (miR)-125b was shown to be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients
We found miR-125b to be significantly upregulated in both APP and PS1 variant neural cultures (Figure
Other microRNAs, such as miR-124, miR-21, and miR-29a/b were reported to be decreased in AD
Accordingly, we observed miR-124 and miR-21 downregulated in both APP and PS1 variant neuronal cultures
Interestingly, miR29a, which is known to be involved in the regulation of APP and b site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression
This is in line with the reports showing that miR-29a could be differently expressed in AD brain

APP Variant HSs Exhibit Increased Protein Aggregation
Both increased phosphorylation of tau in APP variant HSs and neurons (Figures
To examine intracellular protein aggregation in the HSs, we used FTIR, a microspectroscopy-based imaging technique, as described previously
To better resolve the peak positions, we performed a second derivative analysis (de
Strikingly, analysis of FTIR spectra revealed a significant increase in the content of b sheet structures in APP but not in PS1 variant HSs compared with controls (Figures
This suggested that, although the Ab42/Ab40 ratio was increased in both APP and PS1 variant HSs, protein aggregation may be ongoing in the APP variant HSs only.
Since both neurons and astroglia were found in HSs, we investigated whether these two cell types could contribute to the increased protein conformational changes and aggregation in the AD variant HSs.
We performed FTIR in neuronal cultures generated by dissociating HSs and culturing single cells as a monolayer until aged 56 DIV, and astroglial cultures generated by culturing HSs-derived progenitors as monolayers in medium containing ciliary neurotrophic factor until aged 100 DIV.
We observed robust and significant increases in b sheet structures in APP hippocampal neurons.
These data were confirmed when using a different platform and different iPSC clones (Figure
Interestingly, astrocytes derived from APP variant, but not from PS1 variant and control HSs (Figures
These data indicated that pathological changes also occur in AD astrocytes, as recently suggested
Importantly, we found no increase in b sheet structures in APP variant parental fibroblasts, demonstrating that protein aggregation is not present in the patient APP variant fibroblasts.
This allowed us to rule out the possibility that pathological aggregation had been transferred from the APP variant fibroblasts to the iPSCs during reprogramming (Figures
Further assessment of protein aggregation by FTIR revealed elevation in the 1,513-cm À1 band, reflecting structural changes in tyrosine and tryptophan amino acids sen-sitive for phosphorylation
Interestingly, significant elevation of the 1,513-cm À1 band was found in the two AD variants fibroblasts, although the level was low in PS1 variant fibroblasts (Figures
Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Important Alterations in the Proteome of APP and PS1 Variant HSs To gain insights into cellular network alterations in APP and PS1 variants, we performed a quantitative assessment of the HS proteome, using label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
We identified over 6,000 proteins present in all 4 studied genotypes (Figure
Principal component analysis confirmed the HS segregation based on the gender (component 1) and the genotype (component 2) of the fibroblast donors (Figure
The largest sets of significantly dysregulated proteins were detected in APP variant HS (Table
Subsequently, we performed pathway enrichment analysis of the identified dysregulated proteins, using the online bioinformatics tool DAVID.
Notably, we found that proteins dysregulated in APP and PS1 variant HSs displayed a diversity of functions and were involved in several distinct pathways.
For example, spliceosome, purine metabolism, and mRNA surveillance pathways were the highest of the significantly enriched pathways identified in APP variant HSs, where proteins were upregulated (Figure
In contrast, in HSs harboring the PS1 variation, we identified DNA replication and DNA repair pathways as the most strongly enriched in upregulated proteins (Figure
Similarly, we identified heterogeneity between the two AD variants when examining pathways enriched in downregulated proteins.
Thus, in APP variant HSs, lysosomes, and phagosomes, endocytosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum were the highly enriched pathways, among others, in downregulated proteins, whereas, in PS1 variant HSs, oxidative phosphorylation, endocytosis, axon guidance, lysosome and phagosome were the most strongly enriched pathways in downregulated proteins (Figure
Since we found decreased levels of synaptic proteins synaptophysin and drebrin by western blot (Figure
Of all synaptic-related proteins analyzed, 26 were commonly downregulated in both APP and PS1 variant HSs (Figure
Among them, we identified LIN7 proteins, which are important mediators of synaptic vesicle exocytosis
Interestingly, an equal number of 90 different synaptic proteins were found specifically downregulated in APP or PS1 variant HSs.
Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins were associated with biological processes centered around synaptic function, and included synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter secretion, and vesicle-mediated transport (Figures
Finally, quantitative LC-MS/MS revealed alterations in several AD-related pathways (Figure
Notably, specif-ically in APP variant HSs, we observed downregulation of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, particularly complex IV and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HSD17B10), supporting the hypothesis of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD
We found a decrease in the levels of APOE, the major genetic risk factor for developing late-onset AD
Other groups of proteins were found downregulated in both variant samples, although this was more profound with the APP variant, e.g., proteins  responsible for clearance of Ab peptide.
For example, the lysosome and the phagosome were the most enriched pathways among the downregulated ones in the samples carrying the APP variation.
Among the most upregulated proteins, the components of the spliceosome machinery, including almost all the complexes in the pathway, were upregulated in both APP and PS1 variant samples.
Interestingly, two proteins belonging to the histone deacetylase class 1 group (HDAC2 and HDAC3), which are known as transcriptional repressors
Similarly, the proteins lipoprotein lipase and low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein 1, which were previously found to be overexpressed in AD

ND1 Ex Vivo Gene Therapy Modulates the Transcription of Genes Relevant to AD Pathogenesis
We previously demonstrated that viral delivery of single transcription factor ND1 is sufficient to increase the maturation of rodent neural progenitors into neurons
To evaluate the potential of human HSs to serve as a translational platform for the development and/or testing of therapies for AD, we examined whether viral delivery of ND1 was sufficient to modulate the expression of genes differentially expressed in AD patient HS neurons compared with control.
We used Affymetrix GeneChip microarray to examine early transcriptomic changes in APP variant cells compared with control, upon viral delivery of ND1.
We detected 377 genes whose expression was changed in APP variant cells compared with control (Figure
While the majority of genes (282), products of which participate in various biological processes, were downregulated in purified APP variant GFP-positive cells compared with control GFP-positive cells, 95 genes were upregulated, including genes encoding various GABA receptors, expression of which is altered in the early stages of AD
Following transduction, ND1 expression was robustly identified (Figure
Importantly, principal component analysis showed that ND1 overexpression changed the transcriptomic profile of APP variant GFP-positive cells, from a diseased state to an almost healthy control one (Figure
In particular, ND1 positively modulated the expression of genes involved in synaptic transmission (Figures 6D-6F; and Table

DISCUSSION
Here, we report an innovative method to chemically induce HSs from human iPSCs, which we used in a proofof-concept study to model two patients carrying typical and atypical AD-related gene variations.
We show that exposure of human iPSCs from different genders (male or female) and molecular diagnosis (diseased or healthy) to chemical agents LDN-193189, SB-431542, XAV-939, cyclopamine, and CHIR-99021 is sufficient to generate HSs containing LEF1-positive medial pallium progenitors, which when matured further formed hippocampal neural cells at different stages of maturation.
While this original protocol produces approximately the same percentage of cells positive for ZBTB20 and PROX1, as recently reported by
It also does not require iPSC-derived hippocampal neural progenitors to be plated on a monolayer of primary hippocampal astrocytes to generate mature neurons
Although HSs contain functional neurons, they were almost devoid of astrocytes.
This is a significant drawback as astrocytes recently emerged as a new important target of AD
Hence, to examine protein aggregation in astrocytes, we had to modify our protocol to generate astrocytic monolayer cultures.
Since during human development astrocytes are generated later than neurons, we may assume that the number of astrocytes in the HSs may increase over time.
With the constant improvement of protocols aiming at generating oligodendrocytes from human iPSCs
Cellular pathology was recently examined in iPSC-derived microglia
We utilized 3D hippocampal structures generated from iPSCs, to examine cellular dysfunction in typical and atypical familial AD.
We used several techniques, from routine (western blotting, immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR, MSD multi-array, and Affymetrix GeneChip microarray) to more sophisticated (whole-cell patch-clamp recording, synchrotron-based FTIR, and quantitative LC-MS/MS) and identified a wide variety of disease phenotypes.
Some of them were reported previously when analyzing downregulation in both variant, while blue and red labels indicate significant downregulation in PS1 or APP variant, respectively.
n = 3 independent differentiations per genotype, n = 2 LC-MS/MS analyses.

postmortem tissue, e.g., increased ratio of Ab42/Ab40 peptides, which can be neurotoxic
Importantly, we identified cellular alterations that varied between the two AD variants, as also reported by others
For example, we provide evidence of a significant increase in the content of b sheet structures and in the level of tau phosphorylation in APP but not in PS1 variant HSs compared with the controls.
The difference of disease phenotypes, which was more prominent, or speculatively more advanced, in the APP variant when compared with the PS1 variant, could potentially be attributed to the fact that this patient carried a homozygous variation p.V717I in the APP gene
Alternatively, it is possible that the PS1 variant displayed milder cellular phenotypes due to the nature of the variation.
Indeed, patients carrying this PS1 p.R278K variation show a wide clinical spectrum, even between family members, from classical AD to pure spastic paraparesis
In this particular case, spastic paraparesis was the initial feature, which we speculate might explain the lesser phenotypic changes (e.g., protein aggregation) in HSs from the PS1 compared with APP variants.
The correlation between patients' symptoms and cellular pathogenesis was demonstrated by several groups, including
In addition, the wide variety and heterogeneity of the phenotypes identified could be influenced by factors that exacerbate or alleviate them.
One limitation of this study is the number of patients used.
This is due to the uniqueness of the variations they carry: homozygous APP London variation is rare
To minimize this limitation, we used several independent iPSC clones per individual, to examine the efficacy of our protocol and the main readout assays (tau phosphorylation and protein aggregation).
Nevertheless, HSs allowed us to identify early disease phenotypes consistent across the different iPSC clones studied, which is not possible with current imaging methods, such as positron electron tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
Our work also raises the question whether AD is a neurodevelopmental disorder?
AD is considered, such as Parkinson disease and several other common neurodegenerative disorders, as a disease of the aging brain
Early disease cellular phenotypes can be identified using pre-and post-natal rodent brain cells
This raises even more attention when modeling diseases using iPSCs.
Indeed, even if iPSCs are non-natural cell types generated by the reprogramming of (often) aged somatic cells
Over the last decade, experimental work using iPSCs suggests that early disease phenotypes can be identified as soon as a few weeks to few months in vitro for several neurodegenerative disorders
Moreover, recent work suggested that early therapeutic intervention could alleviate early behavioral, cellular, and molecular changes seen in Huntington disease (HD)
This raises the (D) 2D annotation enrichment analysis for biological pathways based on the differential expression profiles of transcripts between hippocampal neurons transduced with ND1 and GFP, in both control (x axis) and APP variant (y axis).
Pathways significantly enriched after ND1 overexpression are highlighted, downregulated (blue) and upregulated (red).

possibility that early pharmacological intervention in AD (and other neurodegenerative disorders) might also be valuable.
Toward this aim, we evaluated the effect of ND1 on human HSs-derived neuronal progenitors.
This strategy was previously used with in vitro and in vivo systems, and it proved to be beneficial in rodent models of AD by reversing memory impairment
We found that ND1 positively modulated the expression of genes involved in synaptic transmission (Figures
This is important since synaptic transmission impairment is a hallmark of AD pathology
This proof-of-concept study further showed that HSs could serve as a platform for developing therapeutic strategies and evaluate their mechanism of action at the cellular level.
In conclusion, iPSC-derived HSs provide a complementary technology to 2D human hippocampal monolayers developed recently
HSs can further be grafted into immunodeficient mice, either as single cells, as we did, or as a whole

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All reagents and procedures details can be found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Generation of iPSCs
Primary human dermal fibroblasts were harvested by punch skin biopsy from AD patients and healthy donors after written informed consent.
Reprogramming factors (OCT-3/4, KLF-4, SOX-2, and c-MYC) were delivered using a non-integrating Sendai virus vectors kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
A month later, several colonies were collected and expanded as single clones for 7 days.
Two to three iPSC clones per individuals were selected for further expansion and characterization (Figure
The reprogramming of patient cells into iPSC was approved by the Swedish work environment authority.
An additional female control line (TALSCTRL15.12)
was received from Target ALS (
and NHCDR Repositories hosted by RUCDR.
Work was carried out according to European and Swedish national rules, with the highest level of ethics.

Differentiation of iPSCs to HSs
Human iPSC colonies were dissociated using dispase and transferred into ultra-low adherent flasks (Corning) in WiCell medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2 and 20 mM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Selleck Chemicals, Munich, Germany).
Next day, WiCell was replaced with neural induction medium composed of advanced DMEM/F12, 2% B27 Supplement without vitamin A (v/v), 1% N2 Supplement (v/v), 1% NEAA (v/ v), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (v/v).
For dorsomedial telencephalic neural specification, LDN-193189 (Stemgent, 0.1 mM), Cyclopamine (Selleck Chemicals, 1 mM), SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mM) and XAV-939 (Tocris, 5 mM) were added to the medium for the first 10 days with medium change every other day.
On the 10th day, the free-floating spheres were transferred to neuronal differentiation medium (NDM) containing Neurobasal medium, 1% N2 (v/v), 1% NEAA (v/v), L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (v/v).
To promote hippocampal differentiation, NDM was supplemented with CHIR-99021 (Stemgent, 0.5 mM) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (PeproTech, 20 ng/mL) for 90 days with medium changes every second day.
