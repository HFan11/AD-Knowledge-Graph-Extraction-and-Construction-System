Genome-Wide Association Studies for Cerebrospinal Fluid Soluble TREM2 in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia.
Rare variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been identified as risk factors for AD.
Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a potential and novel biomarker of neuroinflammation implicated in the onset and progression of AD.
To explore the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using the data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
We found CSF sTREM2 levels were elevated with the disease stages, but there was no significant difference between that of AD patients and normal participants.
CSF sTREM2 was positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (ρ > 0.35, p < 1e-06; ρ > 0.32, p < 1e-05, respectively) for all disease states.
We identified the most significant CSF sTREM2 related locus was rs7232 (FDR = 3.01e-08), a missense variant in MS4A6A gene of chromosome 11.
Moreover, we also detected rs7232 was highly associated with MS4A6A gene expression (FDR = 1.37e-18).
In addition, our pathway analysis for our significant GWAS results showed that biological processes for regulation of viruses and immune response were highly overrepresented or enriched.
Our study suggests that CSF sTREM2 plays an informative role in AD progression.
Moreover, CSF sTREM2 and AD is highly related to viral infections and immune response.

INTRODUCTION
The most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in brain, neuroinflammation, and progressive decline in cognition and memory loss finally
Although AD is a complex, multigenic and multifactorial disorder, most genetic, physiological and pathological studies suggest that the balance between production and clearance of Aβ contributes to its development
Microglia are the brain-resident effective phagocytes for the uptake and proteolytic clearance of both soluble Aβ oligomers and insoluble Aβ fibrils
Many studies have detected that microglia surrounded Aβ plaques in the brain of AD patients
The protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an innate immune receptor expressed on microglia and on myeloid cells outside the brain
It plays crucial roles in microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons, damaged myelin, and Aβ plaques
In addition, TREM2 regulates microglial proliferation, survival
Several studies reported that the rare TREM2 mutation, arginine 47 to histidine (p.R47H, rs75932628) substitution in the extracellular immunoglobulin domain, significantly increases the risk for AD with odds ratios similar to those of carrying an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele
TREM2 protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by ADAM proteases, releasing its ectodomain into the extracellular space as the form of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2)
Although elevated CSF sTREM2 levels were initially reported in neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis
Recent study reported that CSF sTREM2 exerts functional roles in microglia by promoting inflammatory responses and shielding them from apoptosis
Furthermore, an AD mouse model study demonstrates a protective role of sTREM2 against amyloid pathology and related toxicity
However, the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD remain unclear.
To gain insight into the mechanism of AD development according to CSF sTREM2, in this study, we analyzed the correlation of CSF sTREM2 levels with AD status and other important CSF and clinical biomarkers from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
Moreover, we performed genomewide association studies (GWAS) to identify novel variants and genes associated with sTREM2 level and AD by using CSF sTREM2 and gene expression data as phenotypes.
Additionally, we implemented pathway analysis for sTREM2 related genes to get a better understanding of AD pathology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database
ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and by private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a public-private partnership.
The principal investigator of ADNI is Michael W. Weiner, MD.
The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined together to measure the progression of AD.
We applied for and were granted permission to obtain data from the ADNI cohort

Subjects
In this work, analyses were restricted to ADNI subjects with CSF sTREM2 data available.
The study sample (N = 1001) included 224 healthy normal (NL), 72 significant memory concern (SMC), 234 early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 277 late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 194 AD participants.

CSF and Clinical Biomarkers
Cerebrospinal fluid sTREM2 measurements were done with the ELISA protocol previously established by the Haass' group with minor changes.
The assay is based on the MSD platform and it is comprehensively described in their previous publications
The CSF levels of amyloid-β 1-42 peptide (Aβ 42 ), total tau (tau) and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 (p-tau) were determined using the fully automated Roche Elecsys immunoassay platform
The 13-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS13) was developed to measure memory and cognition for patients with mild to moderate AD
ADAS13 scores were automatically calculated on the electronic case report form based on item level data entered.
Semi-automated hippocampal volumetry was carried out using a commercially available high dimensional brain mapping tool (Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (SNT), Louisville, CO, United States) for MRI data of subjects, that has previously been validated and compared to manual tracing of the hippocampus

Genotyping Data
The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data of ADNI-1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2 cohorts were collected from either the Illumina 2.5-M array or the Illumina OmniQuad array
The SNPs shown in both arrays were used for the following analyses.
Quality control (QC) analysis was conducted by using R package snpStats
In the QC, we excluded any SNPs that did not meet any of the following criteria: (1) SNPs on chromosome 1-22; (2) call rate per SNP > 95%; (3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test of p-value >10 -6 (absolute value of z-score <4.753424).
After QC analysis, 2,379,855 SNPs remained for the subsequent analyses.

Gene Expression Data
Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood samples from ADNI participants were performed at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) laboratories.
The Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array
Raw expression values obtained directly from CEL files were pre-processed using the Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) normalization method

Statistical and Genetic Analyses
The CSF sTREM2 levels for different disease stages and their correlation with other CSF and clinical biomarkers were determined by using R software.
To identify the association between SNPs and CSF sTREM2 levels, we performed (quantitative trait locus) QTL analysis using the R package Matrix expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
In this analysis, age, gender (1 for male and 2 for female) and diagnosis (1 for NL, 2 for SMC, 3 for EMCI, 4 for LMCI, and 5 for AD) at baseline were considered as covariates.
Manhattan plots of QTL results were generated using the R package qqman
The regional plot for QTL results was obtained from LocusZoom
The linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot was generated through R package gaston.
The association between significant SNPs (FDR < 0.05) of our QTL results and gene expression data was detected by performing eQTL analysis.
eQTL analysis was also conducted using the R package Matrix eQTL for the filtered SNPs, with the same covariates as our QTL analysis.
Here, we considered both cis-eQTL analysis (local, distance < 1Mb) and trans-eQTL analysis (distant, distance ≥ 1Mb or the SNPs even locate on different chromosomes).

Pathway Analyses
For the significant genes (FDR < 0.05) of SNP-gene pairs form our eQTL results, gene ontology (GO) analyses were performed using the Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) statistical over-representation test v14.1
, which used data from the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC)
PANTHER utilizes a binomial distribution test to calculate overrepresentation of candidate genes, relative to background, for different GO terms
Additionally, we also conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for these genes through the software GSEA Desktop v3.0
Here, we applied R package limma

RESULTS

Correlations of sTREM2 With AD Biomarkers
In ADNI cohort, we saw that CSF sTREM2 levels increased with the disease progression from SMC group to AD group
pg/mL for SMC, EMCI, LMCI, and AD subjects, respectively; Figure
However, only the difference between EMCI state and AD state was significant (p < 0.05; Figure
Though the mean CSF sTREM2 levels for AD patients was a little higher than that of normal subjects (4206.102
pg/mL), there was no significant difference.
Levels of sTREM2 in the CSF did not correlate with TREM2 gene expression in the blood samples (Spearman's ρ from -0.1007 to 0.1746, p > 0.05; Figure
Next, we investigated the correlation of its CSF levels with other AD highly associated CSF and clinical biomarkers to explore its role in AD pathology.
CSF sTREM2 levels showed highest correlation with CSF Aβ 42 in SMC group (ρ = 0.3307, p = 0.0046; Figure
The overall correlation between CSF sTREM2 and CSF tau were high for all the five disease states (ρ from 0.3543 to 0.6546, p < 1e-06; Figure
SMC group showed the highest correlation (ρ = 0.6546, p = 4.465e-10) while AD group had the lowest one (ρ = 0.3543, p = 4.292e-07; Figure
Similarly, CSF sTREM2 also correlated with CSF p-tau for all the five categories (ρ from 0.3213 to 0.6398, p < 1e-05; Figure
Same as the case for CSF tau, the correlation of SMC group ranked first while that of AD was the smallest.
For ADAS13 scores, the correlation between them and CSF sTREM2 were low generally (ρ from -0.0137 to 0.1612; Figure
Moreover, there was no strong correlation between CSF sTREM2 levels and hippocampus volumes (ρ from -0.1483 to 0.0082, p > 0.05; Supplementary Figure

GWAS of sTREM2 Levels in CSF
We then performed QTL analysis to study the association between genotype (SNPs) and CSF sTREM2 levels.
According to our analysis, the significant loci concentrated in chromosome 11 (Figure
The most significant one was rs7232 (p = 1.32e-14,
FDR = 3.01e-08; Table
The regional association plot of rs7232 is shown in Figure
The second most significant SNP was rs1582763 (p = 3.85e-14, FDR = 4.41e-08; Table
The top 10 most significant FIGURE 2 | Manhattan plot and regional plot of the results from QTL analysis for CSF sTREM2 levels.
(A) Manhattan plot of -log 10 (p-value) from the results of QTL analysis.
(B) Regional plot for the most significant SNP rs7232 identified by the QTL analysis.
The r 2 measures the linkage disequilibrium of each SNP with the most significant SNP rs7232 according to hg19/1000 Genomes Nov 2014 AMR population.
Points with gray color indicates that their r 2 values were not available in the reference genome.
SNPs were all located on chromosome 11.
Moreover, they were either within or near to MS4A gene family (Table
Besides identified SNPs on chromosome 11, there were also SNPs showed significant association on other chromosomes, such as rs3799468 (p = 4.10e-12, FDR = 2.85e-07) located in MAP7 gene on chromosome 6, rs181768270 (p = 4.19e-12, FDR = 2.85e-07) proximal to gene RNF187 on chromosome 1, and rs116087048 (p = 4.19e-12, FDR = 2.85e-07; Supplementary Table
The list for all identified SNPs with p < 0.05 from our QTL analysis can be found in Supplementary Table
Next, for exploring the interactions among the identified significant SNPs on chromosome 11, we selected the SNPs with FDR < 0.05 and located within ±1Mb from rs7232.
40 SNPs including rs7232 remained for the analysis.
The LD pattern for these 40 SNPs is illustrated in Figure
Among them, the weakest LD occurred between rs7232 and rs1582763 (r 2 = 0.68), while the LD between rs7232 and rs12453 was the strongest (r 2 = 0.83; Figure
The strong LD between rs7232 and rs12453 may be due to that both of them locate in same gene MS4A6A.
The LD of the SNP pairs rs1151065-rs558788, rs11230160-rs920573, and rs6591559-rs1530914 were extremely high (r 2 = 1.00 for all the three SNP pairs; Figure
For we wanted to study how the SNPs associated with CSF sTREM2 levels regulated gene expression, we chose the SNPs with FDR < 0.05 identified by our QTL analysis for the following eQTL analysis.
There were 240 SNPs left for this analysis.
In our cis-eQTL analysis (local eQTL analysis, the distance between SNPs and associated genes is less than 1Mb), the top 10 identified most significant SNPs were all located on chromosome 11, and they all associated with MS4A6A gene (Table
rs12453 ranked first (p = 9.02e-23, FDR = 8.14e-19; Table
Another SNP within MS4A6A gene, rs7232, showed the third most significant association (p = 4.57e-22, FDR = 1.37e-18) with it.
Furthermore, rs1582763 was also significantly associated with MS4A6A gene expression (p = 3.58e-17, FDR = 1.9e-14;
Supplementary Table
For the results of trans-eQTL analysis (distant eQTL analysis, the distance between SNPs and associated genes is bigger than 1Mb, or they even locate on different chromosomes), the association between rs113239743 and CPT1C gene was the most significant (p = 6.53e-44,
FDR = 7.73e-37; Table
Moreover, rs113239743 also showed significant association with TESMIN gene (p = 3.91e-30, FDR = 9.27e-24), and CCND2 gene (p = 2.43e-25, FDR = 2.39e-19).
The results for all identified SNPgene pairs with p < 0.05 from our cis-eQTL analysis and those with FDR < 0.05 from trans-eQTL analysis are demonstrated in Supplementary Tables

Pathway Studies
For the SNP-gene pairs identified from both cis-eQTL and trans-eQTL analysis for CSF sTREM2, we chose the genes from the results with FDR < 0.05 for the following pathway analysis.
We found 4295 qualified genes.
Firstly, we performed statistical overrepresentation test for these genes.
According to the value of fold enrichment, the highest one was negative regulation of viral process (fold enrichment = 2.27, p = 5.16e-03; Table
What's more, top three categories were all related to virus regulation.
In this list of top 10 categories, four of them were associated with viral process and one was in connection with immune response (neutrophil activation involved in immune response; Table
In addition, the most significant category was neutrophil activation (fold enrichment = 1.85, p = 3.76e-11; Table
The results for all identified GO categories with corrected p-value less than 0.05 from this analysis are illustrated in Supplementary Table
In addition to overrepresentation test, we also implemented GSEA for these over 4000 significant genes identified by our eQTL analysis.
For the gene sets (GO categories) upregulated (positively enriched) in AD, 10 of them were significant at # Ref genes: the number of genes in the reference list that map to this particular annotation data category.
#Genes: the number of genes in our eQTL analysis identified gene list that map to this annotation data category.
Expected: the number of genes we would expect in our gene list for this category, based on the reference list.
Fold enrichment: # Genes/Expected.
p-value: Bonferroni-corrected p-value.
FDR < 0.25.
On the other hand, there were only 3 such categories for gene sets downregulated (negatively enriched) in AD (Figure
The top positively enriched GO category was immune response (NES = 2.4469, p < 0.001, FDR = 0.0859), while the top negatively enriched gene set was myeloid cell development (NES = -2.6369,
p < 0.001, FDR = 0.0624; Figure
There was another GO category related to immune response (regulation of immune response, NES = 2.4966, p < 0.001, FDR = 0.1136) in the top 10 significant positively enriched gene sets, which ranked third.
Moreover, two of the significant downregulated gene sets were for myeloid cells.
The full lists for upregulated and downregulated results with p < 0.05 of GSEA are in Supplementary Tables S5, S6, respectively.

DISCUSSION
In 2014, a study revealed a significant reduction of CSF sTREM2 in AD patients (n = 56) compared to control individuals (n = 88, p = 0.001;
However, 2 years later, another study reported that the CSF sTREM2 levels were significant higher in AD cases compared to controls [median and range: 1028 (244-2570) and 832 (163-2196) pg/ml, respectively; p = 0.015] in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) cohort with 73 AD subjects and 107 controls
Here, we detected that the difference of CSF sTREM2 levels between AD and normal participants was not significant in ADNI cohort (Figure
These inconsistent results from different cohort studies may be caused by the timing for measuring the CSF sTREM2 levels in AD patients.
Some studies for different cohorts report that the CSF sTREM2 increased in early symptomatic stages of AD, but it decreased in late stage of the disease
The mechanisms behind such findings still remain elusive.
A possible reason would be that a part of sTREM2 released from microglia is retained within the barrier formed by microglia around plaques in the late stage of AD
Longitudinal data is required for further study about the relation between CSF sTREM2 levels and disease states.
Additionally, another explanation for the inconsistency would be the different proportions of subjects with TREM2 variants in their studies.
Some TREM2 variants affect CSF sTREM2 levels dramatically
CSF total tau and p-tau are passively released into CSF by dying neurons.
CSF total tau levels reflect the intensity of neuronal damage and degeneration, with higher amounts of tau releasing to CSF for more intense neurodegeneration.
Similar to total tau, some studies report correlation between high CSF p-tau and higher rate of cognitive decline
We showed that CSF sTREM2 levels were positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau levels for all disease status in ADNI cohort (Figures
The mechanism for CSF sTREM2 in pathogenesis of AD is still unclear based on these preliminary findings.
Further studies are needed to reveal its role in neurodegeneration.
As for CSF Aβ 42 , some studies showed that its levels were not correlated with CSF sTREM2 level generally
However, our analyses by disease stages detected that there were positive correlations between them for all status except for EMCI group in ADNI.
Furthermore, the correlation was strongest for SMC group (Figure
These imply CSF sTREM2 may play a crucial role at the very early symptomatic stage of AD.
Our QTL analysis showed that rs7232 was the most significant SNP associated with CSF sTREM2 level.
A recent study for Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and Lifestyle (CABLE) cohort
Moreover, one study showed that rs7232 correlated with atrophy rate of left middle temporal and minor T allele carriers had less loss in the volume of left middle temporal than A allele homozygotes subjects
In addition, rs7232 was identified as a protective locus for AD
p = 2.621 × 10 -14 ).
Our eQTL analysis detected that rs7232 was significantly associated with its located gene MS4A6A, which was supported by other studies
Membrane Spanning 4-Domains A6A (MS4A6A) has been identified as one of the significantly associated loci with AD
MS4A6A expression levels were found to be associated with elevated Braak tangle and Braak plaque scores
Furthermore, one study reported that MS4A6A expression was significantly correlated to AD-related neurofibrillary pathology and tau phosphorylation
Additionally, the expression of MS4A6A is highly correlated with the expression of TREM2 in the brain
For both MS4A6A and TREM2 are mainly expressed on microglia cells in the brain
The second most significant SNP associated with CSF sTREM2 was rs1582763 from our GWAS (Table
These associations were justified by studies from other cohorts
Similar to rs7232, rs1582763 was identified to be associated with reduced AD risk
Our GWAS demonstrated that the top significant SNPs associated with CSF sTREM2 levels were located within or near the MS4A gene cluster and the genes of top significant SNP-gene pairs were also from MS4A gene family (Tables
The MS4A gene cluster encodes cell membrane proteins.
In addition to possibly being involved in the regulation of calcium signaling, MS4A gene cluster has also been reported to be involved in immune-system function
More recently, a study showed that MS4A4A co-localized with TREM2 in human macrophages and both proteins were upregulated in response to IL-4-mediated stimulation
They also found that antibodymediated targeting of MS4A4A was sufficient to reduce sTREM2 levels in human macrophages.
All these provide strong evidence of a biological relation between TREM2 and proteins in the MS4A gene cluster.
Additional studies are required to understand the mechanisms for how MS4A gene cluster modulates TREM2, and affects sTREM2 levels.
As the most significant variant associated with AD risk in TREM2 coding regions, p.R47H (rs75932628) was also genotyped in ADNI cohort.
However, there are no subjects carrying its minor allele T for the available SNP data.
Besides p.R47H, the minor allele (T) of TREM2 rare variant p.R62H (rs143332484) was also reported to be significantly associated with increased AD risk
But it was not genotyped in ADNI genotype data.
These may be due to TREM2 coding variants present very low frequency among people [minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.5%].
Furthermore, some other TREM2 variants have been identified to be associated with AD status
Our GWAS showed that p.T96K and p.L211P were associated with CSF sTREM2 levels (p = 0.005946, 0.009005, respectively; Supplementary Table
These imply that TREM2 variants may modify CSF sTREM2 levels.
For the pathway analyses, we found that some biological processes related to virus regulation were significantly enriched from our statistical overrepresentation test (Table
Interestingly, a previous study for a different AD cohort reported similar results
On the other hand, our GSEA showed that some categories for immune response were significantly positively enriched (Figure
What's more, our previous study
Additionally, some studies reported that the accumulation of Aβ plaque deposits might be a consequence of the over-production of Aβ peptide during viral infection of the brain and Aβ peptide acted as a defense molecule of the innate immunity
The viral hypothesis for AD development has been proposed almost immediately after the first case of AD was reported by Alois Alzheimer in 1907
Researchers started to focus on the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) at the beginning of 1980s
So far, more than 100 studies have connected AD with some forms of pathogen
People may argue that, if viruses do play a causal role in AD, then why there are so many individuals who are infected with the viruses but without developing AD?
This may be due to the feature of many types of virus and bacteria that it is possible to be infected but without being affected.
In recent studies, an important issue about the association of viruses with the substantial accumulation of Aβ in subjects who are cognitively normal is still not addressed
The researchers suggest that it may be the case that Aβ is protective in such cases of participants
If viruses or other microbes contribute to the development of AD, people may reason that could antiviral drug inhibit AD progression.
Some research illustrate that antivirals have such effect.
In one study, researchers found that three different antiviral agents reduced Aβ and p-tau accumulation for Vero cell cultures infected with HSV1
A recent nationwide cohort study from Taiwan provides the first population-level evidence.
This study enrolled 33,000 subjects that about one-quarter of whom were newly diagnosed with HSV infection and followed them for 15 years.
The researchers found that subjects with HSV infection showed 2.5 times more likely to develop dementia than those without infection.
More importantly, compared with HSV infected participants without receiving therapy, subjects with HSV who were treated with antivirals had a 10-fold reduction in the risk of dementia development
These studies show a potential causal role for viruses in AD.
However, the exact nature of the link between viruses and AD is still ambiguous.
More clinical trials of antiviral drugs are needed to evaluate their impacts on AD.

CONCLUSION
We started from CSF sTREM2 levels to explore the pathogenesis of AD according to the data in ADNI cohort.
Firstly, we checked the CSF sTREM2 levels by disease status and found that there was no significant difference between AD and NL groups, though they were elevated with disease stages.
Next, we studied the correlation between CSF sTREM2 levels and other AD highly associated CSF and clinical biomarkers, such as CSF tau, p-tau, Aβ 42 levels, ADAS13 scores and hippocampus volumes, demonstrating that CSF sTREM2 levels were significantly positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels for all disease status.
Furthermore, we performed QTL analysis by setting CSF sTREM2 levels as the phenotype and identified that the SNPs located within or near the MS4A gene cluster were significantly associated with them, with rs7232 and rs1582763 as the top two significant SNPs.
After that, our eQTL analysis for these significant SNPs showed that they were also associated with the expression of the genes from MS4A gene family.
Additionally, our pathway analyses for the important genes from the results of GWAS illustrated that the biological processes for virus regulation and immune response were highly associated with AD.
According to our study, we speculated that the genetic architecture of AD patients might increase their susceptibility to viral infections of the brain.
The more frequent immune activation and response against viral infections may result in progressive neurodegeneration and lead to AD finally.
