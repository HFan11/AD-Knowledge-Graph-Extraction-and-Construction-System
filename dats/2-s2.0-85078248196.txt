Patterns of Expression of Purinergic Receptor P2RY12, a Putative Marker for Non-Activated Microglia, in Aged and Alzheimer’s Disease Brains
Neuroinflammation is considered a key pathological process in neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Many studies have defined phenotypes of reactive microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, with different antigenic markers to identify those potentially causing inflammatory damage.
We took an alternative approach with the goal of characterizing the distribution of purinergic receptor P2RY12-positive microglia, a marker previously defined as identifying homeostatic or non-activated microglia.
We examined the expression of P2RY12 by dual-color light and fluorescence immunohistochemistry using sections of middle temporal gyrus from AD, high plaque and low plaque non-demented cases in relation to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau, markers of pathology, and HLA-DR, IBA-1, CD68, and progranulin, microglial phenotype markers.
In low plaque cases, P2RY12-positive microglia mostly had non-activated morphologies, while the morphologies of P2RY12-positive microglia in AD brains were highly variable, suggesting its expression could encompass a wider range of phenotypes than originally hypothesized.
P2RY12 expression by microglia differed depending on the types of plaques or tangles they were associated with.
Areas of inflammation characterized by lack of P2RY12-positive microglia around mature plaques could be observed, but many diffuse plaques showed colocalization with P2RY12-positive microglia.
Based on these results, P2RY12 expression by microglia should not be considered solely a marker of resting microglia as P2RY12 immunoreactivity was identifying microglia positive for CD68, progranulin and to a limited extent HLA-DR, markers of activation.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, currently affecting an estimated 47 million people worldwide, but this number will increase unless effective treatments are discovered
Since the identification of strongly immunoreactive major histocompatibility class II HLA-DR (MHC-II)-positive microglia associated with AD pathological structures
These early studies established the hypothesis that inflammatory responses to extracellular Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles might be accelerating neurodegeneration through the production of toxic inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and enzymes
Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, are considered the main source of these molecules.
These studies suggested that anti-inflammatory agents might be effective in slowing disease progression
There is now greater appreciation of the complexity of microglia and their many specialized functions, both pathological and reparative.
Recent gene expression profiling studies of microglia isolated from human AD tissue or AD animal models have provided large amounts of data on microglial properties and identified potentially new phenotypic markers for studying microglia in disease
These and other studies have consistently identified the purinergic adenosine diphosphate/triphosphate (ADP/ATP)) receptor P2RY12 as a significant marker for non-activated/homeostatic microglia (examples:
Microglial markers studied in human brains only represent a small number of potential targets.
The most widely-used markers in neuropathology studies of human brains have been MHCII protein HLA-DR and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (IBA-1).
Increased expression of HLA-DR by microglia in AD gray matter has been consistently observed, but the specificity, significance or mechanism for this is unclear, while IBA-1 identifies all microglia and does not discriminate between phenotypes of microglia in human brains.
Other microglial markers characterized in AD brains include CD68, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein associated with phagocytosis, CD32 and CD64, immunoglobulin Fc receptors, CD11b, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2, 3 and 4, ferritin, CD163, Transmembrane Protein (TMEM)-119
P2RY12 is a member of the P2 purinergic family of receptors, a seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor that responds to ADP/ATP by increasing cell migration
P2RY12 is mainly expressed by platelets and microglia
Its function has been widely studied in relation to platelet activation and blood clotting, but its role in neuroinflammation requires further investigation.
Microglia expressed significantly higher levels of P2RY12 than macrophages, in culture and in tissue, allowing discrimination between microglia and blood macrophages
Activation of microglial P2RY12 by ADP/ATP promotes microglial chemotaxis towards sites of release
Expression of P2RY12 by microglia (rodent and human) is downregulated after inflammatory stimulation.
Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into rat brains resulted in rapid loss of P2RY12 immunoreactivity
There have been limited numbers of studies of P2RY12 expression in microglia in human brains by immunohistochemistry.
The most detailed previous study of P2RY12 microglia in human brains across different ages, brain regions and diseases showed expression early in brain development in all regions with limited decline with aging, while characterization of P2RY12-immunopositive microglia in 3 AD cases identified absence of P2RY12-positive microglia around Aβ plaques
P2RY12-expressing microglia in astrocytomas were increased in low-grade but reduced in high-grade tumors
Immunohistochemistry of human brain sections from multiple sclerosis cases confirmed loss of P2RY12 microglial immunoreactivity in areas associated with enhanced inflammation
Another study in 2 AD cases showed that microglia positive for P2RY12 did not express TREM-2
In this report, we sought to determine if P2RY12 could be used for phenotyping the progression of human brain microglial changes in response to AD pathology by extending previous studies
The major findings showed that P2RY12 identified populations of microglia with features of resting microglia but also other populations of microglia.
There was significant reduction in P2RY12 total protein levels in AD compared to ND cases, but significant amount of P2RY12 expression was present even in severe AD cases.
We identified CD68 and progranulin expression in most P2RY12-positive microglia.
In pathologically-involved brains, as P2RY12 expression identified microglia with many of the different morphologies associated with inflammatory activation, classifying P2RY12 expression as a marker of homeostatic (non-activated) microglia needs to be reconsidered.

Results

Patterns of Expression of P2RY12 by Microglia
The aim of this study was to determine if P2RY12 expression delineates populations of resting, non-activated or reparative microglia in human brains affected by different amounts of AD plaque and tangle pathology from microglia considered as pro-inflammatory and activated.
If correct, areas of inflammation around pathological structures could be defined by the presence of P2RY12-positive microglia surrounding areas with P2RY12-negative (activated) microglia.

A feature to note in Figure
Areas with reduced staining were identified by accumulations of HLA-DR-positive microglia (Figure
However, within these clusters of HLA-DR-positive microglia were isolated P2RY12-positive microglia (Figure
Absence of P2RY12-positive microglia in the area around a cored Aβ immunoreactive plaque is shown (Figure
However, the observation of P2RY12-expressing microglia with activated morphologies in close association with diffuse Aβ-positive plaques (high plaque non-demented (HPND) case-Figure
These observations were the basis for further examination of P2RY12 expression by different types of microglia in this report.
Antibody validation was carried out to confirm that the observed immunostaining represented P2RY12 expression by microglia.
Firstly, absorption of the Novus antibody with its immunizing peptide was carried out.
Preincubation of diluted antibody with this 40 amino acid-recombinant peptide resulted in absence of microglial staining (Figure
The second validation step was to demonstrate the same microglial staining pattern using an independent P2RY12 antibody (Alomone Labs) produced against a different immunizing sequence.
Both antibodies produced similar immunoreactivity patterns in sections from a low plaque non-demented (LPND) case (Figure
To demonstrate immunoreactivity with the Alomone antibody, sections required antigen retrieval (80 • C, 30 min, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), which was not required for the Novus antibody.
The third stage was western blot analyses using brain protein extracts to demonstrate that the Novus antibody could detect a P2RY12 polypeptide of approximately 58 kDa, (representative western blots are shown in Figure
This antibody also identified a polypeptide of approximately 30 kDa, a presumptive cleavage fragment of the full-length P2RY12 polypeptide.
Although a number of different molecular weights for P2RY12 have been shown depending on cell source and antibody, a 58 kDa polypeptide is consistent with previous observations.

Continued Expression of P2RY12 in MTG Brain Samples with Increasing Pathology and AD: Biochemical Measurements
Increased microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines have long been considered a feature of AD.
If widespread throughout the AD brain, one would expect levels of P2RY12 to be very low in severe AD cases if expression was restricted to non-activated microglia.

If widespread throughout the AD brain, one would expect levels of P2RY12 to be very low in severe AD cases if expression was restricted to non-activated microglia.
We measured the levels of P2RY12 expression in MTG sections from brains with increasing amounts of plaque pathology (Table
Western blot measurements of levels of P2RY12 polypeptides were made in protein samples from LPND (n = 10), HPND (n = 9) and AD cases (n = 9) (representative western blot-Figure
Protein extracts were not available from 6 cases used in immunohistochemistry.
The Novus P2RY12 antibody detected two polypeptide bands in brain samples, one of approximately 58 kDa (considered to represent full-length P2RY12) and one of approximately 30 kDa.
Semi-quantitative measurements of band intensities, normalized for β-actin levels, showed significant decreased levels of 58 kDa polypeptide in AD cases (Figure
Spearman non-parametric correlation analysis between levels of 58 kDa polypeptide and plaque and tangle scores showed significant negative correlation (P2RY12 (58 kDa)/β-actin levels compared to plaque scores; r = -0.503,
p = 0.0039 (F 1,29 = 7.618, p < 0.001): compared to tangle scores; r = -0.612,
p = 0.0002 (F 1,29 = 24.06,
p < 0.0001).
As the Novus antibody was raised against an intracellular C-terminal peptide sequence of P2RY12, the 30 kDa bands could represent accumulations of P2RY12 after proteolytic cleavage.
Its functional significance is unclear.
Measurement of P2RY12 mRNA expression in cDNA derived from a similar but separate group of MTG samples (Table
These results showed that significant amounts of microglial expression of P2RY12 mRNA and protein were still occurring in AD brains.

Patterns of Expression of P2RY12-Positive Microglia and Amyloid Beta Plaques
When considering features of microglial activation in AD, one feature not generally considered is the anatomical distribution of microglia within brain structure.
The features of neuronal architecture throughout the cortex results in different patterns of pathological development and different phenotypes of microglia.

In the HPND case illustrated (Figure
The morphologies of P2RY12-positive microglia varied, particularly in HPND and AD cases, and many of the plaques had associated P2RY12-positive microglia with activated morphologies.
Due to the shrinkage of cortical layers in AD, the layers in LPND and HPND sections are slightly wider; white matter regions in Figure

Confocal Microscopy Localization of P2RY12 with HLA-DR, CD68 and Progranulin in Brain Microglia
To follow up observations, further investigations of the phenotypes of P2RY12-positive microglia using antibodies to activation markers HLA-DR, CD68 and progranulin were carried out using multicolor laser confocal microscopy to demonstrate cellular colocalization.
In LPND cases with fewer HLA-DR positive microglia, those present showed colocalization with P2RY12 immunoreactivity (example: Figure
In HPND cases, with greater numbers of HLA-DR positive microglia cases, there was less colocalization between P2RY12 (green) and HLA-DR (red) immunoreactivity (Figure
Similarly, in AD sections (Figure

Similar analyses were carried out comparing co-expression by microglia in LPND, HPND and AD MTG sections for P2YR12 and CD68, the monocyte-specific phagocytic lysosomal marker (Figure
Both proteins have been considered as markers of activated microglia.
We had hypothesized that there would be a clear discrimination between P2RY12 and CD68 staining to distinguish between resting and phagocytic microglia, but this was incorrect.
We observed that most P2RY12 positive microglia were also positive for CD68.
The distribution of P2RY12 and CD68 in top cortical layers are shown in Figure
Higher magnification images of these cases show that there was strong CD68 staining in low pathology cases (Figure

Patterns of Expression of P2RY12-Microglia with Different Types of Plaques in Pathologically Staged Cases
Confocal microscopy with multi-layered images of P2RY12-immunoreactive microglia with Aβ provide additional information on their interactions.
We had earlier observed that there were two types of P2RY12-positive microglia having interactions with Aβ plaques.
Those surrounding plaques and those interacting with plaques.
It might be assumed that all Aβ plaques would activate the microglia in a proinflammatory manner resulting in downregulation of P2RY12 expression.

Neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites are also a hallmark pathological feature of AD pathology.
In this study, we identified them using antibody AT8 that recognizes phosphorylated forms of tau (serine 202/threonine 205)(pTAU) that accumulate in tangles and neurites.
The cases studied had been staged based on plaque not tangle pathology.
There was little difference in tangle scores between LPND and HPND cases, but a large increase in the AD cases (Table

In Vitro Analysis of P2RY12 Expression by Human Microglia
Our brain tissue observations of P2RY12-expressing microglia have shown multiple features of these cells in relation to their activation states.
To further investigate if increased P2RY12 expression represents a marker of alternative activation, cultured human brain-derived microglia were treated with interleukin-4 (IL-4), Aβ peptide and other proinflammatory agents to determine how activation affects P2RY12 mRNA expression.
Samples analyzed by qPCR for P2RY12 mRNA expression showed strong induction of expression by IL-4 treatment, and downregulation to different extents with Aβ and other proinflammatory agents (Figure
Induction of P2RY12 protein was also observed by western blotting in IL-4-treated microglia (Figure

Discussion
The aim of this work was to examine phenotypes of P2RY12-immunopositive microglia in aging and AD brains in relation with AD-associated pathological structures.
P2RY12 has been defined as a specific marker to discriminate between microglia, with high levels of expression, and macrophages, with low levels of expression
In addition, based on experimental findings, continued expression by microglia of P2RY12 in brain should define them as non-activated, namely those not producing proinflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced inflammation.
As experimental studies have shown that proinflammatory activation of microglia resulted in significant reduction in P2RY12 expression
The findings of this work showed that microglial expression of P2RY12 was downregulated in AD tissue samples, but immunohistochemistry identified more complex patterns of increased P2RY12 expression associated with pathological structures than previously identified
Recent gene expression profiling of single-cell microglia from rodent and human sources had confirmed that P2RY12 mRNA expression was associated with a non-activated phenotype and expression was downregulated with progression of disease
However, our initial observations in human brains suggested that this might not cover all features of P2RY12 expression by microglia; for this reason, we sought to provide detailed characterization of P2RY12 microglia in human aged and AD brains.
The importance of microglial phenotyping to identifying functional markers is now appreciated along with the need for greater numbers of markers
For a number of years, the classification of microglia (and macrophages) into functional M1 and M2 groups was applied but it is now appreciated that this system does not account for the complexities of microglial phenotypes in diseased brains
Recent findings have defined a phenotype of microglia designated "disease-associated microglia" (DAM), which describes a transcriptional signature first associated with response to neurodegeneration-associated molecular patterns (DAM stage 1) that progresses to a signature associated with a protective role to limit inflammation (DAM stage 2) that is coordinated by TREM-2 signaling.
Downregulation of P2RY12 from homeostatic to stage 1 DAM confirms earlier findings but our cellular localization findings suggest that upregulation of P2RY12 may also be a feature associated with later stages of AD.

Downregulation of P2RY12 from homeostatic to stage 1 DAM confirms earlier findings but our cellular localization findings suggest that upregulation of P2RY12 may also be a feature associated with later stages of AD.
We have made some new findings on P2RY12 expression by microglia in human brains as part of this study that extend previous findings
There were decreased levels of total P2RY12 protein of 58 kDa in brain extracts from AD cases compared to non-demented low and high pathology cases, as could be expected, but we also identified increased levels of 30 kDa P2RY12 polypeptide in AD cases.
This indicates that downregulation of P2RY12 protein levels might due to enhanced cleavage of this plasma membrane protein.
The antibody we used for our study was prepared against a 40-amino acid recombinant peptide corresponding to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of P2RY12 (amino acids 303-342).
P2RY12 is a G-protein-coupled receptor for ADP containing 7-transmembrane domains.
Based on this structure, the 30 kDa polypeptide would represent a remaining cell-associated peptide that does not contain the N-terminal sequences.
As P2RY12 has been reported to have multiple ADP-binding domains, it is unclear if this fragment will be biologically active for ADP binding and signal transduction.
Downregulation of P2RY12 expression as a result of proinflammatory activation and upregulation as a response to IL-4 were regarded as features of alternatively activated microglia though the mechanisms for this to occur in brains is unclear as IL-4 expression has not been consistently detected in brain tissue
We showed that downregulation of P2RY12 expression following inflammatory stimulation also occurred in cultured human microglia as did others
The involvement of progranulin, a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory molecule, in microglial function is still unclear.
Progranulin positive microglia are found throughout brain but our findings showed P2RY12-positive microglia in all disease groups were positive for intracellular progranulin.
It has been shown that IL-4 upregulates progranulin expression by cultured human microglia
Based on current findings of gene regulation, one can speculate that P2RY12/progranulin positive microglia are protective rather than reactive, but further studies are required.
A previous study of P2RY12 microglia across different human brain regions and ages made similar observations as this study that most P2RY12-positive microglia were also CD68 positive
CD68, a myeloid specific lysosomal-associated membrane protein associated with phagocytosis, has been considered as a microglial activation marker in a number of studies
Two earlier studies have observed that P2RY12 was not expressed by microglia accumulating around plaques in AD brains.
We also observed this for many plaques, but there were noticeable exceptions as many diffuse-like Aβ(6E10-immunoreactive) plaques had P2RY12-positive microglia interacting with them.
We also observed varied morphologies for P2RY12-microglia interacting with plaques, including fragmented, tufted and rod-shaped.
The study of
Detection differences in these studies could be due to tissue fixation conditions.
Our study employed lightly-fixed free-floating brain sections for immunohistochemistry, while Mildner et al. employed harder-fixed paraffin-embedded sections
For their study, antigen retrieval was required for all antibodies, while we found this not necessary for free-floating sections when using the Novus antibody.
However, sensitivity of P2RY12 detection to fixation was observed as the alternate antibody (Alomone-APR-012) we used only worked when free-floating sections underwent antigen retrieval processing.
Although P2RY12 appears to be an excellent marker for microglia in brain, it is unclear whether expressing microglia can be classified as protective or proinflammatory.
How P2RY12-mediated responses by microglia are involved in AD pathogenesis is unresolved.
P2RY12-mediated chemotactic responses to ATP and ADP, which are released by damaged or dying cells, appears to be an early inflammatory response.
The rapid downregulation of P2RY12 expression with proinflammatory activation would appear to function to anchor microglia at sites of inflammation.
It has been proposed that downregulation of P2RY12 is accompanied by increased expression of adenosine A2 receptor, the breakdown products of P2RY12 ligands ADP/ATP
A recent in vitro study of microglia demonstrated the proinflammatory consequences of inflammasome and NFκB activation by extracellular ADP activation of P2RY12
In a rodent ischemia model, blockade of microglial P2RY12 with ticagrelor, an antagonist, reduced ischemic damage by microglia by reducing their migration to sites of injury
In another ischemia animal model, and with an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), inhibition of microglia P2YR12 with clopidogrel, another antagonist, or by P2RY12 gene expression knock-down significantly reduced microglial migration and neurotoxicity
The potential for using P2RY12-positive microglia distribution to define distribution of neuroinflammation in AD or other neurodegenerative diseases is still valid, though not as clear as originally hypothesized.
There has been a widely-held concept that AD neuroinflammation is widespread through affected areas, but these findings suggest it is highly localized.
If one considers the scheme outlined in Figure
With the use of laser capture microscopy and proteomics techniques, analyses of micro-dissected regions are feasible and could identify key neuroinflammatory factors associated with AD that are not represented when larger dissected pieces of brain tissue are analyzed.
The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in proteomic analyses of micro-dissected plaques and tangles from AD brains

Human Brain Tissue Samples
Human brain tissue samples used in this study were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program, Sun City, Arizona, U.S.A.
The operations of the Brain and Body Donation Program (BBDP) have received continuous approval of Institutional Review Boards (IRB).
Current operations have been reviewed by Western IRB (Puyallup, WA, USA).
Written informed consent for collection and use of brain and other tissues for research purposes were obtained from donors or next-of-kin.
Tissue studies carried out in the U.S.A. were considered non-human subject research under federal regulations.
Tissue studies carried out in Japan were approved by Shiga University of Medical Science Ethical Committee (Project Certificate no.
29-114).
Demographic details of cases used in this study are summarized in Table

Brain Tissue Preservation and Fixation
All brains were processed at autopsy in a standardized manner
The median postmortem interval for autopsies in the BBDP was 3.8 h.
After brain removal, the cerebellum and brain stem are separated from the hemispheres, then each brain is sectioned in a frame into 1cm thick coronal slabs.
The hemispheres are divided, with the left hemisphere being frozen on dry ice for storage at -80 • C, and the right hemisphere being fixed for 48 h in buffered formalin solution.
After fixation, the coronal pieces are rinsed and transferred to a phosphate-buffered solution of 15% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant.
Brain regions used for subsequent studies are dissected from frozen or fixed coronal slices by experienced neuroanatomists.

Neuropathological Diagnosis Criteria
All donated brains received full neuropathological diagnosis including reference to pre-mortem clinical history of each case.
Consensus clinical and neuropathological criteria were used to diagnose AD, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD in these cases
To assess severity of AD pathology in each case, tissue sections from 5 brain regions (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, frontal cortex, temporal cortex and parietal cortex) were stained with Thioflavin-S, Gallyas or Campbell-Switzer histological stains and assessed semi-quantitatively for the density of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques with each brain region being ranked on a scale of 0-3.
By combining the measures across these 5 brain regions, assessment of AD pathology was ranked on an ordinal scale of 0-15 for plaques and tangles
The two sets of cases used in this study were subdivided into non-demented low plaque (LPND) (plaque score < 6), non-demented high plaque (HPND)(plaque score 6-14) and AD with dementia (plaque score > 12).

Peroxidase/Diaminobenzidine Immunohistochemistry
Formaldehyde-fixed tissue sections (25 µm) from middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 36 cases cut on a sliding microtome were used for cellular localization of purinergic receptor P2RY12 in relation with AD pathological markers, amyloid-beta (Aβ and phosphorylated tau, or markers of microglia activation (HLA-DR, and IBA-1).
Sections of hippocampus from 4 cases (2 LP, 2 AD) were also used for comparison.
A free-floating immunohistochemistry method was used.
Tissue sections from a series of cases were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline-Triton X100 (PBSTx) (0.1 M phosphate Buffer, pH 7.6, 0.137 M NaCl, 0.3% Triton X100) and pretreated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBSTx for 30 min to quench endogenous tissue peroxidases.
For certain antibodies, antigen retrieval was carried out by heating sections in 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) at 80 • C for 30 min and then cooling to room temperature for 30 min.
Sections were incubated free-floating at room temperature for 18 h with shaking in PBSTx with optimal dilution of antibodies.
To identify localized antibodies, sections were sequentially washed three times in PBSTx for 10 min, incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody (1:1000), sequentially washed again three times in PBSTx and then incubated in preformed avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase enzyme complex (ABC-Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA USA) solution (1:1000) for 1 h.
Sections were then washed three times in PBSTx and two times in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) before incubation in peroxidase substrate.
Most frequently used was nickel ammonium sulfate-enhanced diaminobenzidine as substrate to produce a purple reaction product (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% saturated nickel ammonium sulfate, 40 mM imidazole, 100 µg/mL diaminobenzidine-HCl (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and 0.0003% hydrogen peroxide).
For two-color immunohistochemistry, reacted sections were rinses in PBSTx, treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide to remove residual peroxidase activity and then incubated for a second time in primary antibody overnight at room temperature.
The detection procedure followed the above described protocol except the substrate used was diaminobenzidine without nickel ammonium sulfate as substrate to produce a brown reaction product (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mM imidazole, 200 µg/mL diaminobenzidine-HCl and 0.0006% hydrogen peroxide).
Reacted sections were mounted on slides, counterstained in most cases with 0.5% neutral red, dehydrated, cleared and coverslipped using Permount mounting media (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA Sections used for quantitative measurements were not counterstained.

Fluorescent Confocal Immunohistochemistry
Multiple-color fluorescent confocal immunohistochemistry was carried out for antibody pairs to verify cellular co-localization of antigens with P2RY12-expressing cells
Tissue sections were incubated with optimal dilutions of antibodies at room temperature overnight with shaking.
After three washes (10 min each) in PBSTx, sections were incubated in the dark with optimal concentrations of fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies.
Bound primary antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey anti-goat IgG), Alexa Fluor 568 (donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) or Alexa Fluor 647 (donkey anti-mouse IgG) (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA, USA).
After washing and mounting, sections were counterstained with Sudan Black (1% solution in 70% ethanol for 10 min) to quench tissue autofluorescence, destained with 70% ethanol, and stained with DAPI to reveal nuclei.
Sections were coverslipped using antifading-hardening-fluorescent mounting media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Sections were imaged using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope, and compiled Z-scans obtained and processed using Olympus microscope system software (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Some sections were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope system (Leica-Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

Fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies used for confocal microscopy, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies used for western blots were obtained from ThermoFisher (Waltham, MA, USA).

Verification of Antibody Specificity
The majority of the immunohistochemistry studies reported in this communication were carried out with the Novus P2RY12 antibody.
Peptide absorption studies were carried out using a recombinant 40-amino acid protein (NBP2-33870PEP, Novus), the immunizing peptide for the Novus antibody (NBP2-33870).
P2YR12 antibody (1:1000) was mixed with 20-fold molar excess of protein for 18 h, and these materials were used to stain sections from three separate cases in parallel with non-absorbed antibody.
In addition, comparisons of immunostaining patterns were carried using an independent antibody to P2RY12 (1:250, Alomone Labs), prepared against an 18-amino acid peptide sequence that did not overlap with the immunizing sequence of the Novus antibody.

Brain Sample Extraction and Western Blot
Brain tissues samples (middle temporal gyrus -MTG) were dissected frozen and then further trimmed so samples being analyzed primarily contained gray matter.
Detergent-soluble extracts were prepared by gently sonicating each tissue sample in 5 volumes (weight to volume) of RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Nacalai-Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).
After 30 min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged at 15,000× g for 30 min.
The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and total protein concentration of each extracted sample was determined using a Micro BCA assay kit (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA) with bovine serum albumin as standard.
P2RY12 polypeptides were detected in MTG samples by western blots using the Novus P2RY12 antibody (1:1000).
Protein samples were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, adjusted to contain 1 µg/µL protein, denatured by heating to 90 • C for 10 min, centrifuged at 15,000× g for 10 min to remove insoluble material and then separated on 4-20% Tris-glycine precast gradient polyacrylamide gels (Nacalai-Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).
Separated polypeptides were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore-EMD) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus.
Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk solution diluted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated for 18 h in optimal dilutions of antibody solution in 2% milk in TBST.
Membranes were washed in TBST and then reacted with HRP-labeled secondary antibody for 2 h.
Membranes were reacted with Chemi-Lumi-One Super chemiluminescent substrate (Nacalai-Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and sequential images captured using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 system (GE LifeSciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Band intensities were measured using Image Studio Lite (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).
All membranes were subsequently reacted with HRP-labeled antibody to β-actin (FujiFilm Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) at 1:15,000 for 1 h and imaged in the above-described manner.
Band intensities were normalized for levels of β-actin in samples.

Area of P2RY12 Immunoreactivity
To measure area of P2RY12 immunoreactivity, a complete series of cases (see Table
After mounting and coverslipping of sections, images at 4x magnification were captured from each section, taking four separate, random fields of gray matter for each section.
Captured images were analyzed using ImageJ analysis software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) (
version 1.52a, accessed on 5 January, 2018) to measure area of immunoreactivity occupied by reaction product on each slide.
Images were converted to gray scale and thresholds adjusted to identify positively stained microglia.
Mean values of area occupied between the four separate fields measured were calculated for each case, and then mean data were compiled into respective disease groups for further statistical analysis.

P2RY12 Immunoreactive Cell Counts
Further analyses were carried out to estimate numbers of P2RY12 immunoreactive microglia in each section.
Using a 25-grid-square microscope eyepiece reticule (Nikon) and 20× objective, the numbers of microglia were counted in five consecutive areas through the cortex.
Each field counted corresponded to 2 mm 2 .
These areas corresponded approximately to Layer I and II, Layer III, Layer IV, Layer V, and Layer VI.
For each section, three separate areas were counted where distinct cortical layers could be detected.
The patterns of cortical layers was confirmed by reference to standard text.
These measures allowed sampling through all cortical layers though the AD cases had thinner cortical layers.
Counting criteria required the presence of a microglial cell body to be present within the area of the reticule grid.
For each case, the mean total numbers of cells were calculated, and then mean and standard error of mean for all samples from each disease group.
