Decoding the Role of Astrocytes in the Entorhinal Cortex in Alzheimer’s Disease Using High-Dimensional Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing Data and Next-Generation Knowledge Discovery Methodologies: Focus on Drugs and Natural Product Remedies for Dementia
Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of the development of cognitive decline and dementia.
AD and associated dementias (ADRD) are the major contributors to the enormous burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
To date, there are no robust therapies to alleviate or cure this debilitating disease.
Most drug treatments focus on restoring the normal function of neurons and the cells that cause inflammation, such as microglia in the brain.
However, the role of astrocytes, the brain's housekeeping cells, in the development of AD and the initiation of dementia is still not well understood.
Objective: To decipher the role of astrocytes in the entorhinal cortex of AD patients using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNASeq) datasets from the Single Cell RNA-seq Database for Alzheimer's Disease (scREAD).
The datasets were originally derived from astrocytes, isolated from the entorhinal cortex of AD brain and healthy brain to decipher disease-specific signaling pathways as well as drugs and natural products that reverse AD-specific signatures in astrocytes.
We used snRNASeq datasets from the scREAD database originally derived from astrocytes isolated from the entorhinal cortex of AD and healthy brains from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE138852 and GSE147528) and analyzed them using nextgeneration knowledge discovery (NGKD) platforms.
scREAD is a user-friendly opensource interface available at
enables more discovery-oriented strategies.
snRNASeq data and metadata can also be visualized and downloaded via an interactive web application at adsn.ddnetbio.com.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each snRNASeq dataset were analyzed using iPathwayGuide

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of the development of cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly
AD-related dementias (ADRD) contribute to 50-70 percent of dementias worldwide
AD and associated dementias (ADRD) are the largest contributors to the burden of morbidity and mortality and higher costs in health care systems worldwide
Important risk factors for ADRD include ethnicity, age, and gender.
Approximately 6.2 million Americans aged 65 years or older were affected by AD and this number is expected to double to 13.8 million by 2060 in the United States of America (United States)
Therefore, ADRD has been declared a health priority worldwide
In the United States of America (United States), AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the general population and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged 65 years and older.
In contrast, reported deaths from other debilitating diseases such as stroke, heart disease, and HIV have declined, while deaths from AD have increased by more than 145% in the U.
AD is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain (Figure
It is mostly diagnosed in the older population with an average age of 65 years or more and is referred to as late-onset AD (LOAD)
The progressive damage to neurons from the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Ab) protein and tau protein, as well as neuroinflammation in certain parts of the brain, significantly impairs learning, speech, memory, and other cognitive abilities
Importantly, the risk of ADRD is significantly increased in AD patients with diabetes mellitus
Moreover, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD pathology and the role of specific cells in the brain in the development of ADRD are poorly understood
AD and ADRD pathology differ by brain region, cell type, age, and gender
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using genetic mapping concepts have revealed genes enriched in AD susceptibility loci, and transcriptomics of whole brain tissue using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms or microarray applications have shown an increase in microglial gene connectivity and impairment of neuronal connectivity in AD
Although transcriptional network dynamics of mass analysis can provide more information about AD pathogenesis, it does not reveal all the dynamic changes at the cellular and molecular levels that contribute to AD pathology.
A detailed understanding of the underlying role of individual cell types in AD patients is therefore essential for the development of new therapeutics to treat dementia.
Recent advances in NGS applications such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have enabled researchers to study and understand the dynamic transcriptomic profile of individual cells in brain tissue or other biological samples.
RNA-sequencing of posterior cingulate astrocytes (PC) in AD patients revealed differential expression of mitochondria-related genes, including TRMT61B, FASTKD2, and NDUFA4L2.
In addition, immune response genes such as CLU, C3, and CD74 were identified to play a central role in the generation or clearance of amyloid-beta
scRNASeq provides a higher resolution of cellular dynamics and a better understanding of individual cells in the tissue microenvironment
Similarly, the single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) technique is used to study frozen samples where dissociation of single cells becomes a problem and affects gene expression patterns.
Although AD is one of the     major reasons for the development of cognitive decline and dementia
However, the genetic basis of astrocytes in the development of AD, and the triggering of dementia is still not clearly understood
Therefore, a precise understanding of the underlying role of astrocytes in AD patients may provide clues for the development of effective therapies to treat dementia.
Here, we used an innovative approach to leverage next-generation knowledge discovery (NGKD) platforms to decipher the AD -specific gene signatures in astrocytes isolated from the entorhinal cortex of AD patients and specific synthetic drugs and natural products to improve AD and associated disease pathologies such as dementia.

As of May 2021, the snRNASeq datasets used for this study had been already published and are publicly available

The snRNASeq Data Analysis Using iPathwayGuide
DEGs were obtained using scREAD analysis of snRNASeq data from astrocytes of AD groups (AD00203, AD00205, and AD00206) compared with the healthy control group (AD00201).
DEGs of AD groups (AD00203, AD00205, and AD00206) were further filtered using a p-value cut-off of 0.05, and log2 fold change (Log2Fc) of ±0.3 in iPathwayGuide Software (Advaita Bioinformatics, United States) to obtain 739, 241, and 639 DEGs.
Further analysis of these DEGs using iPathwayGuide software showed that 93 DEGs were commonly regulated in all disease groups (Figure
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to decipher differentially regulated pathways
The iPathwayGuide software used the Impact Analysis Method (IAM)
and Bonferroni multiple testing corrections
The p-values were computed based on the hypergeometric distribution in iPathwayGuide analysis and the FDR and Bonferroni methods for multiple testing corrections

Determination of Upstream Drugs and Natural Products Using iPathwayGuide
The determination of upstream drugs or natural products was predicted based on the enrichment of DEGs and 2) a network of connections or interactions from the Advaita Knowledge Base
The iPathwayGuide analysis was based on two hypotheses (HP and HA).
The overly abundant or present upstream chemical, drug, or toxicant (CDT) was predicted under the conditions analyzed under the first hypothesis called HP and the upstream CDT. is insufficient (or absent) was predicted under the conditions analyzed under the second hypothesis.
HA. iPathwayGuide calculates a Z-score for each CDT z(u) by iterating over the genes in DT(u) and their incoming edges in (g) in testing both HP and HA.
Subsequently, the p-value was computed corresponding to the z-score Pz (One-Tailed) under the probability density function for a normal distribution, N (0,1)

Determination of Upstream Drugs and Natural Products Present or Overly Abundant Using iPathwayGuide
To determine the presence or abundance of CDTs based on the differentially expressed (DE) genes, CDT u, DE genes downstream of u, DTA (u) were compared to measured target genes predicted by chance to be both DE and consistent.
An over-representation method was applied to calculate the statistical significance (p-value) based on the number of consistent DE genes in the iPathwayGuide analysis.
The Ppres (p-value) was calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution
Then, the global probability value (PG) was computed by combining Pz and Ppres: and was used to rank the upstream regulators and test the HP research hypothesis.
The p-values were combined into one test statistic using the standard Fisher's method.

Determination of Upstream Drugs and Natural Products Absent or Insufficient Using iPathwayGuide
To determine the absence or insufficiency of CDTs based on the DE genes, Pabs was calculated using the iPathwayGuide analysis.
The upstream CDTs that were absent or insufficient under the conditions investigated based on the number of consistent DE genes downstream of u, and DTI (u) was compared to the measured target genes predicted by chance to be both DE and consistent.
The Pabs (p-value) was calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution
Then the PG was computed by combining Pz and Pabs and was used to rank the upstream regulators that were absent or insufficient and to test the research hypothesis HA.
The analysis combines Pabs and Pz, using Fisher's method as described previously, where Pz was measured only for significant negative z-scores (z ≤ -2)

L1000FWD and L1000CDS 2 Analyses
DEGs were subjected to L1000 Fire Works Display (L1000FWD) analysis using the L1000FWD signature search application programming interface (API)
Similarly, the same set of DEGs was subjected to L1000 Characteristic Direction Signature Search Engine (L1000CDS2) analysis using the L1000CDS2 Signature Search API to identify the top 50 drugs and natural products with the potential to reverse AD-associated signaling

RESULTS
In the present study, snRNASeq datasets of astrocytes isolated from the entorhinal cortex region of AD patients and healthy brains were obtained from the scREAD database for NGKD platform analysis (Table
The scREAD web tool was used to visualize all cell types and sub-clusters of astrocytes in the entorhinal cortex region of the brain in AD and healthy snRNASeq datasets using UMAP (Supplementary Figure
A UMAP example for the healthy control and AD scREAD datasets is shown in Supplementary Figure
DEGs in astrocytes from the entorhinal cortex compared to healthy controls were determined using paired comparisons with the healthy control (AD00201) and AD (AD00203, AD00205, and AD00206) datasets (Supplementary Tables
The 15 pathways most affected by DEGs in the AD groups compared to healthy controls are listed in Tables
Based on the number of DEGs, the top signaling pathways differentially regulated in the astrocytes of AD patients in the context of neurodegeneration include Alzheimer's disease, prion disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, neurodegeneration signaling pathways (multiple diseases), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the phosphatidylinositol 3kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway.
The differentially regulated KEGG pathways of Alzheimer's disease in the groups of AD are shown in Figures
Analysis of WNT pathway perturbation and PI3K/AKT pathways followed by iPathwayGuide coherent cascade activation revealed the dysregulation of these pathways in the astrocytes of AD patients from the entorhinal cortex (Supplementary Figure
The differentially regulated genes in the WNT pathways and the PI3K/AKT pathways are also shown in Supplementary Figure
In addition to the neurodegenerative diseases, we also observed the signaling pathways associated with Salmonella infection, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and human T-cell leukemia virus infection in the astrocytes of the severe AD groups (Table
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that gene sets involved in cellular components, such as postsynaptic membrane, synaptic membrane, postsynapse, synapse, and synapse, were negatively enriched (p < 0.01).
Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction based on KEGG pathways was significantly downregulated (p < 0.01), and cellular function of the transporter complex was also negatively enriched (p < 0.01).
Similarly, genes associated with glutamate receptor activity, neurotransmitter receptor activity, glutamate receptor signaling, heterophilic cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules, cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, and behavior were also negatively enriched (p < 0.01) in astrocytes from AD patients (Table
Importantly, differential expression of GWAS genes in astrocytes from the entorhinal cortex in the brain of AD is listed in Table
The most downregulated GWAS genes in astrocytes from the entorhinal cortex associated with the pathogenesis of AD were NKAIN3, LRRC4C, CADM2, DLC1, APOE, TNIK, GADD45G, FRMD4A, CTNNA2, NPAS3, NCKAP5, and RORA.
Comparative analysis of the AD datasets from the scREAD based on the DEGs with iPathwayGuide showed that the antirheumatic drugs, vitamin E, salinomycin, and clorgyline have insufficient (p < 0.05) signaling effect in the astrocytes of AD patients (Table
In addition, Tables 8-10 list the drugs or natural products that could potentially reverse the gene signatures of astrocytes in the AD groups (AD00203, AD00205, and AD00206) based on the L1000FWD web tool analysis.
L1000FWD analysis revealed that natural products such as emetine, cephaeline, homoharringtonine, narciclasine, withaferin A and several synthetic drugs such as dasatinib can significantly reverse gene signatures associated with AD pathology.
The drugs or natural products that could potentially reverse the gene signatures of astrocytes in AD groups (AD00203, AD00205, and AD00206) based on the L1000CDS 2 web tool are provided in Supplementary Tables
The L1000CDS 2 analysis uncovered the natural products emetine, narciclasine, trichostatin A, homoharringtonine, ouabain, bufalin, and withaferin A, as well as synthetic drugs, such as dasatinib, that have the potential to reverse AD-associated gene signatures in astrocytes from AD patients.

DISCUSSION
AD is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain and a major cause of the development of cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly
ADRD contributes to the majority of dementia cases worldwide
Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies such as scRNA-Seq and snRNASeq are critical for deciphering the roles of heterogeneous cell populations in the brain at the single-cell level, and subsequent dissecting of these datasets using high throughput knowledge discovery platforms may provide clues as to why a particular group of cells is susceptible to AD and ADRD
Here, snRNASeq datasets of astrocytes isolated from the entorhinal cortex region of AD patients and healthy brains were obtained and analyzed using scREAD web-tool.
scREAD includes 73 datasets from 16 studies, 10 brain regions, and 713,640 cells, and provides cell type and sub-cluster predictions, decipherment of DEGs, and  discovery of cell type-specific regulons
We observed that Wnt signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were dysregulated or impaired in astrocytes from the entorhinal cortex of AD patients.
Wnt signaling is very important at the synapse and necessary for synaptic plasticity and maintenance in the brain
The PI3K/ AKT pathway regulates apoptosis, cell proliferation, and metabolism and is essential for protection against amyloid protein (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity
Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, axon guidance, Alzheimer's disease, GABAergic synapse, glutamatergic synapse, etc. were negatively enriched or dysregulated in astrocytes from AD patients.
GABAergic transmission is essential for all central nervous system functions
This was also confirmed by GSEA analysis, which showed that the sets of genes involved in cellular components such as postsynaptic membrane, synaptic membrane, postsynapse, transporter complex, and interaction between neuroactive ligands and receptors were negatively enriched in the astrocytes of AD patients.
Similarly, genes associated with glutamate receptor activity, neurotransmitter receptor activity, glutamate receptor signaling, heterophilic cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules, cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, and behavior were also negatively enriched in the astrocytes of AD patients.
Importantly, the downregulated GWAS genes in astrocytes derived from the entorhinal cortex, such as NKAIN3, LRRC4C, CADM2, DLC1, APOE, TNIK, GADD45G, FRMD4A, CTNNA2, NPAS3, NCKAP5, RORA, etc., associated with AD pathogenesis, can be used either as biomarkers for neuropathology, AD or LOAD
Interestingly, we found signaling pathways associated with Salmonella infection, HPV infection, and human T-cell leukemia virus infection in the astrocytes of severe AD groups.
Previous studies have shown that infections with Salmonella
We have previously shown that natural products such as albiziasaponin-A, iso-orientin, and salvadorin can ameliorate the pathologies associated with AD in vivo
In addition, we have recently shown that NGKD platforms can be successfully used to find drugs and natural products that may reverse disease-specific gene signatures
Therefore, NGKD platforms can be used to find drugs and natural products that can potentially reverse AD-associated gene signatures in astrocytes.
Here, we used iPathwayGuide, L1000FWD, and L1000CDS2 tools to identify promising drug-responsive molecules for ADRD.
Comparative analysis of AD datasets using iPathwayGuide showed that antirheumatic drugs have insufficient signaling in astrocytes from AD patients.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis
Our finding is consistent with these studies that antirheumatic drugs can reverse AD-associated gene signatures in astrocytes.
Similarly, vitamin E gene signatures were absent in astrocytes from AD.
The role of vitamin E in the treatment of AD remains a controversial topic to date
A recent study found that emetine may have the potential to clear amyloid-beta plaques in AD
The isoquinoline alkaloids emetine and its desmethyl analog cepaheline have been predicted to be protective against cognitive decline and AD
Withaferin A is a steroidal lactone and a withanolide found in the medicinal plant Withania somnifera, and a number of studies have shown that it plays a neuroprotective role in AD
Narciclasine is an active constituent of the Lycoris radiata (L'Her.)
herb.
It is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of AD
A recent study found that senolytic therapy with a combination of dasatinib and quercetin reduced Aβ-associated oligodendrocyte progenitor cell senescence and cognitive decline in an AD model
The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A
Trichostatin A increased the antioxidant capacity and cell viability of SH -SY5Y cells by enhancing Keap1-mediated inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway, thereby reducing amyloid-β peptide-mediated cell damage
Importantly, we recently predicted the potential of withaferin A, narciclasine, and trichostatin A to reverse gene signatures in neuro-COVID
However, the effects of natural products such as emetine, cephaeline, narciclasine, withaferin A, trichostatin A and drugs such as DMARDs and dasatinib which may be able to reverse AD gene signatures in astrocytes should be validated with appropriate experimental models from AD before being used for further clinical testing.

CONCLUSION
The present study provides a valuable method for analyzing snRNASeq datasets deposited in open-source repositories with NGKD platforms to decipher AD -specific pathways, genes, and drugs from synthetic and natural sources for the amelioration of AD-related disease pathologies such as ADRD.
However, further studies are required to confirm these drugs and natural products that reverse the gene signatures of AD using appropriate experimental models to deduce the precise mechanisms of action, followed by appropriate clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the likely therapeutic interventions for AD and ADRD in a typical clinical milieu.
Our innovative approach of applying NGKD platforms to uncover AD-specific pathways and potential drugs and natural products that reverse the ADspecific signatures could be useful in the future for developing personalized medicine for AD patient care.
