Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease through Weak Supervision Deep Learning Framework with Attention Mechanism
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease causing dementia and poses significant health risks to middle-aged and elderly people.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used diagnostic method for AD.
However, it is challenging to collect sufficient brain imaging data with high-quality annotations.
Weakly supervised learning (WSL) is a machine learning technique aimed at learning effective feature representation from limited or low-quality annotations.
In this paper, we propose a WSL-based deep learning (DL) framework (ADGNET) consisting of a backbone network with an attention mechanism and a task network for simultaneous image classification and image reconstruction to identify and classify AD using limited annotations.
The ADGNET achieves excellent performance based on six evaluation metrics (Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1-score) on two brain MRI datasets (2D MRI and 3D MRI data) using fine-tuning with only 20% of the labels from both datasets.
The ADGNET has an F1-score of 99.61% and sensitivity is 99.69%, outperforming two state-of-the-art models (ResNext WSL and SimCLR).
The proposed method represents a potential WSL-based computer-aided diagnosis method for AD in clinical practice.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease of the elderly characterized by progressive dementia and brain degeneration.
It significantly affects cognitive functions, memory functions, the quality of life, and the emotions of more than 50 million people worldwide
According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), AD has become the fifth leading cause of death, and the number of AD patients will increase to 152 million by 2050, and by 2050
However, the etiology of AD remains unclear, and there are no effective drugs or treatments to reverse dementia
The preclinical stage of AD, called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is a transitional state between normal aging and AD
According to a report of the American Academy of Neurology
Unfortunately, due to a lack of understanding of AD by patients and their family members, most patients suffer from moderate and severe stages of AD at the time of diagnosis and have missed the optimal intervention stage
Therefore, it is of great significance to identify the risk and extent of AD as early as possible.
Typically, doctors have to conduct careful medical assessments of patients, such as neuropsychological examinations and neuroimaging, to identify the risk and extent of developing dementia
As a result of significant progress in neuroimaging technology, characteristic changes can now be observed in the brains of patients with AD, including changes in the prodromal and presymptomatic states, providing information for doctors to obtain a more accurate diagnosis
Different forms of neuroimaging techniques have been used in clinical practice to diagnose AD, including computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
CT is a structural imaging technique that integrates X-ray projections from multiple angles and generates cross-sectional or three-dimensional (3D) images
It has the advantages of low cost and fast examination speed.
However, the resolution of the medial temporal lobe is relatively low, which may lead to MCI being misdiagnosed as a normal aging symptom
PET is another structural imaging technique that provides useful information for the diagnosis of AD by detecting the distribution of positron nuclide markers for metabolic information
However, both CT and PET examinations expose the patients to radiation, whereas MRI has the unique advantage of not causing radiation damage
MRI is a medical imaging technique that uses electromagnetic signals obtained from the human body by magnetic resonance to generate images of organs
Moreover, it is highly sensitive to brain contraction and can be used to construct 3D brain tissue images at high resolution
Therefore, it is promising to use MRI to understand and diagnose AD in clinical practice.
With the rapid development and wide application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of AD using neuroimaging may be an auxiliary method to assist physicians.
Here, CAD can be regarded as an image understanding and classification problem.
Deep learning (DL), in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has proved to be an effective method of feature extraction from images and has provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions in different image understanding and recognition tasks.
Various DL-based methods for CAD have also been developed.
Yang et al. designed a patch-based DL framework to detect prostate cancer using MRI data and achieved a specificity of 90.6%
Zhu et al. proposed a landmark-based feature representation method and employed a CNN model for the diagnosis of AD with an accuracy of 91.57%
These methods are supervised learning methods that require a large sample size and high-quality manually annotated data for accurate feature representation
However, it is time-consuming and costly to obtain medical images along with high-quality annotations in practical applications.
Therefore, the development of a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method is of great significance to mine massive amounts of medical image data at a low cost and with high accuracy.
Mahajan et al. presented a WSL method using ResNext
The hashtags were used as labels, and the pre-trained model was fine-tuned on the ImageNet dataset.
The model achieved a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
In 2020, Hinton et al. presented the simple framework SimCLR for contrastive learning of visual representations and trained the SimCLR in a self-supervised learning manner.
The SimCLR achieved a high accuracy of 85.8%, using only 1% of the labels of the ImageNet
This paper proposes a WSL-based DL framework for the identification and classification of AD.
The proposed framework consists of two parts, i.e., the backbone network with an attention mechanism and the task networks.
This paper provides the following contributions:
1.
An attention module (AM) is proposed to improve the discriminative ability of the backbone network with a low computational cost.
The AM is an automatic weighting module that adjusts the weights of the channels in the feature maps so that the backbone network selectively focuses on the significant parts of the input.

2.
The task networks perform two tasks (image classification and image reconstruction) in parallel.
The task networks utilize the feature vector generated by the backbone network and use fully-connected (FC) layers and a decoder for label prediction and image reconstruction.

3.
A multi-task learning (MTL) framework is proposed for conducting image recognition and reconstruction in parallel, with low computational requirements and good performance (with the best F1-score of 99.61% and a sensitivity of 99.69%) using only 20% of the labels from the datasets for fine-tuning.
The rest of the paper consists of five parts.
The related studies are described in Section 2. The proposed method is explained in Section 3. Section 4 summarizes the results.
The discussion is presented in Section 5, and the conclusion is given in Section 6.

Related Works 2.1. Multi-Task Learning
Multi-task learning is a transfer learning method that extracts domain-specific information from related tasks for an improved representation of the input data
The concept of MTL was first proposed by Caruana et al.
Various studies have been conducted to explore effective MTL methods.
Misra et al. built a novel sharing unit to learn representation from different tasks and reported excellent results
Lu et al. developed an adaptive feature sharing mechanism in MTL to identify different attributes of people
In the above studies, each task has a same priority.
While some studies focused on a single task, whereas others acted as auxiliary tasks.
Auxiliary tasks, which provide additional information, provide valid information from aspects of the main task.
Zhang et al. used head pose estimation and attribute prediction of faces as auxiliary tasks and facial landmark detection as the main task; it was found that the precision of this method was higher than that of other methods
Our framework belongs to this type of transfer learning method.

Weakly Supervised Learning
It is well-known that supervised learning-based models require a large amount of well-labeled data to obtain accurate predictions.
In contrast, unsupervised learning-based models typically lack high precision, and the learning process is less effective than that of supervised learning methods
Weakly supervised learning is a machine learning technique with the objective of learning effective feature representation from limited or low-quality annotations
Various WSL-based methods have been explored in different fields.
Hu et al. proposed a CNN-based WSL framework for the task of multimodal image registration and achieved STOA performance
Wang et al. developed a WSL-based method for accurate automated segmentation of remote sensing data with a proposed U-Nets framework and obtained superior segmentation performance
ResNeXt WSL is the most recent WSL method.
It was used to pre-train images from the Instagram website, followed by fine-tuning on the ImageMet dataset
SimCLR, an unsupervised learning method, was used in combination with WSL and achieved SOTA performance

Image Classification
The objective of image classification is to classify an image or instance into categories
With the rapid development and verification of CNNs, various CNN-based frameworks have been developed and used for image classification
LeCun et al. first develop the CNN framework (LeNet) for document recognition
AlexNet, which is an improvement of LeNet and surpassed traditional machine learning methods, won the Imagenet competition in 2012
Since then, different types of CNN architectures have been proposed, such as ResNet
In this study, we adopted the structure of the residual block, which is used in ResNet

Image Reconstruction
Image reconstruction, which is a critical problem in medical imaging, is a technique for creating 2D or 3D images from sets of 1D projections
The autoencoder is the most popular technique and has proved effective in image reconstruction of unlabeled images
In this study, we designed a sub-network to perform image reconstruction using abundant features.

Materials and Methods

The Pipeline of the Proposed Framework
The proposed WSL-based DL framework, which is called ADGNET, is a CNN-based single-input-multi-output (SIMO) architecture consisting of two components: an improved backbone network with the attention mechanism and task nets that consists of two subnetworks, i.e., the classification sub-network (CSN) and the reconstruction sub-network (RSN).
The backbone network has a residual network structure with the proposed AM to obtain highly discriminative representations while suppressing unrelated regions in the images.
As shown in Figure
Generally, feature maps generated by the deeper stages contain more semantic information, and those generated by the shallower stages contain more detailed information, such as edges and corners.
The backbone network extracts features step-by-step from the MRI input images and generates a pooling map using global average pooling (GAP).
The task nets use the pooling map as input and flatten it as a feature vector V f .
The V f is then sent to two different task branches; one generates the prediction vector V p using the FC layer, and the other reconstructs the original images using the FC layers and a decoding module.
As shown in Figure
Here C denotes the number of categories.
Figure
The proposed framework.
The framework consists of two parts, including a backbone network with an attention mechanism that acts as a shared network for extracting salient features and task nets that contain two sub-networks.
The two sub-networks simultaneously conduct two sub-tasks, i.e., classification and reconstruction.

Backbone Network with the Proposed Attention Module
The backbone network is a multi-stage convolution network that follows the Resnet to avoid the gradient vanishing problem.
Different stages in the backbone network generate feature maps with different resolutions.
Notably, the backbone network is a convolution network shared by the two sub-task nets, providing a parameter-efficient and time-efficient method.
In the reconstruction task, the backbone network can be regarded as part of an encoder network that automatically learns the feature representation from the images without annotation information.
In the classification task, the backbone network can be considered a feature extractor, which is optimized using the supervised learning principle.
As described in Section 3.1, each stage of the backbone network generates the attention feature maps after implementing the proposed AM.
As shown in Figure
Given the F s i as input, the AM outputs the channel attention factors ( CAF) with a size of 1 Ã— 1 Ã— C so that the network can automatically determine the importance of the extracted features.This process can also be regarded as a feature filtering and selection method that improves the discrimination ability of the network at low computational cost.
The CAF are then fused with the F s i using the element-wise multiplication operation (EWMO), and the fused feature map F s i is the output.
The feature extraction process of the backbone network can be expressed as follows:
where AM is the proposed attention module, and âŠ— is the EWMO.
The AM is an automatic weighting module that learns the channel weights of the input feature maps.
As shown in Figure
The downsampled feature maps are then flattened into a one-dimensional vector.
The flattened vector is then sent to a convolution layer with a 1 Ã— 1 kernel to extract features from the vector and adjust its dimension.
The extracted features are sent to the batch norm (BN) layer and activated using the ReLU function to speed up the training and convergence speed of the module and increase its nonlinear representation ability.
After these operations, an FC layer (Linear) with ReLU as the activation function is adopted to output the CAF with a size of 1 Ã— 1 Ã— C. The final output is generated using the sigmoid function to convert the values of the CAF to a range of 0 to 1; these values can be considered the importance scores of the channels in the F s i .

Task Sub-Networks
As shown in Figure
The input to the two parts is the flattened vector (V f ).
The two tasks are performed in parallel.
The CSN is a simple FC layer called FC p that generates a vector with a size of 1 Ã— C. The vector is then sent to the sigmoid function to generate the prediction vector (V p ) with a range of 0 to 1 that is used as a probability of prediction of the specified classes.
The process of the CSN can be formulated as follows:
where FC is the FC layer FC p ; Ïƒ is the sigmoid function.
The RSN consists of two components, i.e., the encoder and the decoder.
The encoder is constructed using the backbone network and two FC layers called V e = FC e2 (FC e1 (V f ))
where FC e1 and FC e2 are the FC layers; tanh is the tanh function.
Dec is the proposed decoder part and Im r is the reconstructed image.

Loss Function
The proposed ADGNET can be trained in an end-to-end manner.
The loss function of the framework is composed of two parts and is defined as follows:
where L cls and L rec are the classification loss and the image reconstruction loss, respectively.
Î» 1 and the Î» 2 are the weighting factors which balance the two losses.
As we described in the introduction, it is difficult to distinguish dementia in the early and middle stages from normal aging because of the small differences in brain imaging.
Thus, we adopted the focus idea, as introduced in previous works
We proposed a new loss function based on the cross-entropy loss.
The modified classification loss is defined as follows:
where N is the number of samples participating in a single optimization.
Î³ i represents the class-wise weight reduction factors, which adjust the importance of different samples for an improved representation.
i is the ground truth probability of a target belonging to a given class, and i is the prediction probability of the target belonging to the given class.
The new loss function is a modification based on the cross-entropy (CE) loss.
As shown in Figure
In our manuscript, the values of Î³ i were all set as 2 as default.
We used the mean square error function as the reconstruction loss; it is defined as follows:
where N is the number of samples participating in a single optimization.
Y i is the ground truth value of the input sample, and Å¶i is the prediction value of the reconstructed sample.

The corresponding boxplots of the six evaluation metrics (Kappa, Sen, Spe, Pr, Acc and F1-score) of the models' performance on the KACD dataset are shown in Figure

Discussion
We developed a CAD method for the identification and classification of AD in multimodal brain imaging data (2D MRI and 3D MRI) using WSL-based DL techniques.
Excellent performance was obtained by the proposed ADGNET based on six evaluation metrics, and the method proved superior to two SOTA WSL-based methods.
The proposed ADGNET is a modular framework consisting of a backbone and the task subnets.
We used a residual block in the design of the backbone network to retain the features while preventing degradation of the framework.
We incorporated an AM into the backbone network to ensure the high discriminatory ability of the backbone network with a low computational cost.
Unlike the conventional methods like Resnext WSL which assign the same weight to each channel, the proposed AM learned the channel weights of the input feature maps from the supervised information and the images for an improved feature representation of the samples.
This helps the framework to focus more on the most discriminative part from the feature space.
The feature vector obtained from the pooling map of the backbone network was flattened and sent to the two sub-networks.
The CSN extracted the feature information directly from the vector and was optimized using the supervised information.
The RSN encoded the vector to a new feature space using two FC layers and used a decoder to reconstruct the input images.
The two FC layers and the backbone network comprised the encoder that was used for feature coding.
The proposed decoder network consisted of the transposed convolution layer and the convolution layer.
The objective of the transposed convolution layer was to learn the feature information for image reconstruction, and the convolution layer was used to adjust the number of channels and generate the final output.
Unlike previous WSL-based methods (e.g., ResNeXt WSL and SimCLR), which have to be pretrained on a large independent dataset and fine-tuned on the target dataset, the proposed ADGNET is trained in an end-to-end manner.
The training process of the ADGNET is controlled by adjusting the weighting parameters.
When Î» 1 is zero, the network only learns the features from the images.
When Î» 2 is zero, the network only learns the features from the annotations.
In this way, the large-scale unlabeled data can be fully utilized to help the proposed framework obtain more stable and representative features.
Excellent performance was achieved by ADGNET based on the six statistical metrics for the multi-modal brain imaging datasets (KACD (2D MRI) and ROAD (3D MRI)).
In order to intuitively analyze the experimental results, the heatmaps of the proposed ADGNET and the two SOTA models were demonstrated in Figure
As can be seen from Figure
While the ResNeXt WSL and SimCLR only use very limited features for prediction and their prediction scores are relatively low.
Notably, the ADGNET's prediction score is quite higher than ResNeXt WSL and SimCLR, which indicated that the ADGNET's prediction is more reliable.
The ADGNET has a promising potential as an auxiliary tool to assist in the diagnosis of AD due to its high performance, good stability, and cross-modal flexibility.
Besides, medical diagnosis in a real situation is much more complex than in experimental environments, and sufficient and high-quality annotations are difficult to obtain.
Therefore, the development of our proposed WSL-based DL methods is crucial for diagnosing conditions such as AD.
However, the proposed ADGNET may also encounter some problems when the distribution of the data has extremely category imbalance.
It is also important to develop effective generative frameworks to generate a large amount of effective data for compensation with WSL-based methods.

Conclusions
This study presented a unique WSL-based DL framework for the identification and classification of AD using multi-modal brain imaging data (2D MRI and 3D MRI).
The proposed ADGNET provided excellent performances on six metrics (Kappa, Sen, Spe, Pr, Acc and F1-score), outperforming the two SOTA WSL-based models on two public datasets (KACD (2D MRI) and ROAD (3D MRI)) using limited annotation (only 20% of the labels).
Most notably, the Kappa of the ADGNET was 0.9922 on the KACD dataset and 0.9736 on the ROAD dataset.
These values were 2.50% and 1.88% higher than those of the two SOTA methods on the KACD dataset and 10.49% and 9.66% higher on the ROAD dataset, respectively.
The excellent performance achieved by ADGNET indicates that the proposed AM and the framework are suitable for the task and that the model is superior to the two SOTA WSL-based methods.
The proposed AM module enabled the ADGNET to automatically assign different weights for different channels in the feature maps for a better capture of discriminative features.
It is well-known that obtaining a large sample size and highquality annotations of medical images is time-consuming and expensive.
The introduction of sub-network for image reconstruction task help the ADGNET acquire effective features mining from large scale unlabeled data.
Therefore, the development of WSL-based DL methods might represent a potential research direction to achieve accurate mining of massive medical data.
In the future, the potential of this framework will be explored in-depth for other challenging tasks, including the detection of brain tumors and other major diseases.

The backbone network extracts and abstracts the features step-by-step, and the two FC layers encode the features into a vector (V e ).
The decoder component is a multi-layer transposed convolution network.
The details of the decoder component are shown in Figure3.
The input of the decoder component is the V e after the reshape operation, which converts the V e to a two-dimensional feature map.
The decoder is a modular network consisting of two parts with multiple transposed convolution layers.
Each transposed convolution layer in the decoder has multiple transposed convolution kernels with a size of 3 Ã— 3, a stride of 2, and a padding of 1.
As shown in Figure3, there are MÃ— transposed convolution layers and ReLU layers in the first part, which decode the input feature maps and up-sample the input.
The second part of the encoder contains a convolution layer and a Tanh layer.
The convolution layer is used for dimension normalization to convert the feature maps to the same size as the input MRI image.
The Tanh layer is used to output the predicted MRI image since it has a wide range of predicted values, improving the prediction accuracy.
The RSN process can be formulated as follows:
