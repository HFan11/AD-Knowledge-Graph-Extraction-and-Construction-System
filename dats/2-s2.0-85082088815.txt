Benzothiazolyl Ureas are Low Micromolar and Uncompetitive Inhibitors of 17β-HSD10 with Implications to Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment
Human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 is a multifunctional protein involved in many enzymatic and structural processes within mitochondria.
This enzyme was suggested to be involved in several neurological diseases, e.g., mental retardation, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease, in which it was shown to interact with the amyloid-beta peptide.
We prepared approximately 60 new compounds based on a benzothiazolyl scaffold and evaluated their inhibitory ability and mechanism of action.
The most potent inhibitors contained 3-chloro and 4-hydroxy substitution on the phenyl ring moiety, a small substituent at position 6 on the benzothiazole moiety, and the two moieties were connected via a urea linker (4at, 4bb, and 4bg).
These compounds exhibited IC 50 values of 1-2 µM and showed an uncompetitive mechanism of action with respect to the substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA.
These uncompetitive benzothiazolyl inhibitors of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 are promising compounds for potential drugs for neurodegenerative diseases that warrant further research and development.

Introduction
Human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17β-HSD10) is an enzyme belonging to the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR)
The enzyme was discovered by a yeast two-hybrid screening assay conducted to detect novel protein interaction partners of the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) and was denoted as ERAB (endoplasmic reticulum-associated binding protein) or ABAD (amyloid-beta binding alcohol dehydrogenase)
At around the same time, the enzyme was found to be identical to L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
17β-HSD10 is a NAD + -dependent dehydrogenase with a very wide range of substrates and functions, including the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids, the catabolism of isoleucine
Besides the enzymatic activities of this multifunctional enzyme, the non-enzymatic activities appear to be critical for either mitochondrial health or neuronal cells development.
17β-HSD10 was found to be a component of mitochondrial RNAse P complex
The protein is expressed in a variety of tissues and the expression pattern in the human brain appears to be region-specific
Human 17β-HSD10 enzyme is one of the known interaction partners of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, a key peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
The production and deposition of the Aβ into extracellular insoluble plaques is one of the morphological hallmarks of AD and the pathological mechanism responsible for massive neuron deaths in the human brain
Aβ interacts with 17β-HSD10 via several amino acids within the D-loop region, a unique sequence insertion that is absent in all other members of the SDR family.
This interaction was detected in the brains of patients with AD and experimental transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein and 17β-HSD10
Overexpression of the 17β-HSD10 enzyme resulted in mitochondrial matrix condensation and the partial loss of cristae structure
The inhibition of 17β-HSD10 enzymatic activity or its interaction with the Aβ peptide are vital approaches for the protection of mitochondria against Aβ-driven toxicity.
Several inhibitors of 17β-HSD10 were developed; however, to date, none has reached the drug market.
The first structure known to inhibit the interaction complex of the 17β-HSD10 enzyme and Aβ was the "decoy peptide".
This peptide contains amino acids located in the D-loop of the 17β-HSD10 enzyme, a region responsible for the 17β-HSD10-Aβ interaction
The decoy peptide inhibited the binding of 17β-HSD10 and Aβ  in vitro, with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 1.7 µM.
The administration of the decoy peptide to transgenic animals overexpressing amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and 17β-HSD10 enzyme protected mice neurons from amyloid-induced cytotoxicity
Shortly after the 17β-HSD10 decoy peptide was introduced, Xie et al. identified small-molecule inhibitors that could block the enzyme-peptide interaction.
Their screening revealed benzothiazole derivatives thioflavin T and frentizole (Figure
Frentizole, structurally a 1-(6-methoxy-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-3-phenylurea, is known potent non-toxic immunosuppressive agent used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus
Based on its structure, several series of benzothiazolyl ureas and thioureas were synthesized, and the best hits showed IC 50 values of < 10 µM
By using the benzothiazolyl urea compounds as a vital scaffold,
Interestingly, these compounds were only tested for the ability to inhibit enzymatic function of 17β-HSD10 instead of testing their ability to block 17β-HSD10-Aβ interaction.
The best hit compound 4b (Figure
Further compounds targeting 17β-HSD10 are focused on the inhibition of the enzymatic activity.
A small molecule 17β-HSD10 nonsteroidal irreversible inhibitor was developed by
The compound designated AG18051
Other novel 17β-HSD10 enzyme inhibitors were developed with the aim to treating androgen-and estrogen-dependent diseases.
The best hit compound, a steroidal inhibitor designated as RM-532-46 (Figure
A subsequent study of the steroid inhibitor RM-532-46 and non-steroidal benzothiazole phosphonate derivatives that used purified enzyme and stably transfected HEK-293 cells revealed that the transformation of 17β-estradiol to estrone was inhibited with an IC 50 of 1.7 µM
Moreover, this steroidal inhibitor was also active against the 17β-HSD3 enzyme; thus, this inhibitor is more likely to be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer
Recently, several publications came out focusing on development of 17β-HSD10 inhibitors that were structurally derived from benzothiazolyl urea scaffold of frentizole (Figure
In 2016 Hroch et al. published a series of benzothiazolyl ureas with the best compounds showing 60% decrease in 17β-HSD10 activity in 25 µM screening (Figure

However, there was no improvement in 17β-HSD10 inhibition compared to the previous publication
In 2017 Benek et al. published series of frentizole analogues with urea linker replaced with thiourea or guanidine.
The most promising compound with guanidine linker showed good inhibition activity with IC 50 3.06 µM
The latest publication from 2019 by Aitken et al. presents large structure-activity relationship (SAR) study addressing changes to benzothiazole moiety, urea linker and phenyl moiety of frentizole and previously identified inhibitors 13 and 14 (Figure

17β-HSD10 Reductase Assay and Enzyme Kinetics
The enzyme activity of the human recombinant 17β-HSD10 was determined from previously published methods using acetoacetyl-CoA (AAC) as a substrate
The method was based on the decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cofactor absorbance at 340 nm during its utilization by the enzyme.
To establish the reaction properties correctly, the enzyme kinetic parameters were determined.
The Michaelis constant (Km) obtained for acetoacetyl-CoA as a substrate, 79.2 ± 15.0 μM at pH 7.4, corresponded to the previously reported values of 117 ± 28 μM
The maximum reaction rate, Vmax, for the enzyme, was estimated to be 27.7 ± 1.8 μM•min -1 .
Based on known Km values, the substrate concentration for compound screening and IC50 evaluation was chosen as 320 μM (4 × the Km value).

Discussion

Discussion
In our previous work, compounds harboring the 3-chloro-4-hydroxy substitution on the phenyl ring alongside the 6-substitution (fluorine, chlorine, trifluoromethyl) on the benzothiazole moiety (Figure
Within this study we made different modification into the structure of previous hits (compounds
Firstly, a series was prepared that combined different patterns of fluorine, hydroxy, or methoxy substitutions of the phenyl ring, together with fluorine, chlorine, or methoxy substituents in position 6 of the benzothiazole moiety (4a-4u).
Fluorine substitution of the phenyl ring was used instead of the original chlorine to improve physico-chemical properties, and methoxy substitution of the benzothiazole moiety instead of the original halogen substituent was introduced for the same reason.
Most compounds within this series were found to be less active thanthe parental compounds 13 and 14.
Any deviation from the original 3-chloro, 4-hydroxy substitution of the phenyl ring resulted in decrease in inhibitory activity except for 3,5-fluoro, 4-hydroxy substitution pattern (4g-4i), which resulted in inhibition comparable to the parental molecules 13 and 14.
There was no significant difference in activity between compounds substituted with fluorine, chlorine of methoxy group in the position 6 of benzothiazole moiety.
Secondly, we explored the SAR of the phenyl ring by changing the position and amount of hydroxy and chlorine substituents and, further, by introducing methoxy and carboxy groups, while the original 6-chlorobenzothiazole moiety was fixed along with the urea linker (4v-4aj).
However, none of modification led to stronger inhibitory ability compared to the parental compound 14.
We also focused on the urea linker, which was replaced with thiourea or guanidine.
These substitutions (4ak, 4al) did not lead to enhanced inhibitory ability and resulted in more than 70% of residual enzyme activity.
In the next series, the original 6-chlorine substitution of the benzothiazole moiety was moved to alternative positions 4, 5, and 7 (4am, 4an, and 4ao).
Derivatives with chlorine in position 5 or 6 showed inhibition similar to parental compound 14 (~55% residual activity).
While the substitution in position 7 (4ao) increased the inhibition (38% residual activity).
Further, the benzothiazole core was replaced with benzoxazole (4ap, 4aq, and 4ar) or benzimidazole (4as, 4at) while relocating or omitting the original 6-chlorine substitution.
5-and 6-chlorobenzoxazole derivatives were of similar potency compared to the parental compound 14, however, the unsubstituted benzoxazole derivative was found slightly better (41% residual activity).
5-and 6-chlorobenzimidazoles showed improved potency resulting in 30% and 36% residual enzymatic activity respectively.
Finally, different substituents in position 6 of the benzothiazole moiety, along with fixed 3-chloro-4-hydroxy pattern on the phenyl ring and urea linker (4au to 4bg), were evaluated.
The preferred substituents for inhibition were hydroxy (4bb) > amine (4bg) ~methoxy (4ba) > hydrogen (4au) ~methyl (4ay) > trifluoromethyl (4az) moiety, resulting in 26% to 49% residual enzymatic activity.
In contrast, substitution with bromine, iodine, acetyl, carboxymethylate, nitrile or nitro group led to similar or decreased inhibition ability compared to original 6-chloro substitution.
In the next step, we have selected 13 compounds (4an-4ap, 4ar-4au, 4ay-4bb, 4bf, and 4bg), which showed similar or even stronger inhibitory effects on 17β-HSD10 than the previously published compounds 13 and 14, to determine their IC 50 values.
All these compounds shared a common phenyl part, with 3-chlorine, 4-hydroxy substitutions, together with the urea linker, but they differed in the substitution of the benzothiazole, benzoxazole, or benzimidazole moiety.
The obtained IC 50 values ranged from 1 to 7 µM (Table
The three most potent inhibitors 4at, 4bb, and 4bg with IC 50 < 2 µM were further used for kinetic experiments to determine the type of inhibition.
From this point of view, all the selected inhibitors were found to act via an uncompetitive mode of action with respect to acetoacetyl-CoA as a substrate of the reaction.
This is in contrast to the mixed inhibition mode described for similar type of inhibitors by
However, when looking closely at the previously published data, the mode of inhibition seems to be identical.
This is because the uncompetitive inhibition can be considered as a subtype of mixed inhibition and deeper analysis of the previous kinetic experiment would probably yield the same conclusion, i.e., uncompetitive mode of inhibition.
In drug research and development, uncompetitive inhibitors are relatively rare, although they can provide unique physiological consequences.
The inhibitors can bind the target only if the substrate is present and this mechanism of action should be favorable for enzymes with cellular substrate concentration higher than the enzyme K m value
Several drugs act in an uncompetitive manner towards dehydrogenases or reductases with a NAD + /NADH pair as their enzyme cofactor: e.g., mycophenolic acid, reversible inhibitor of inosine 5 -monophosphate dehydrogenase
Development of uncompetitive inhibitors is a very valuable strategy in drug discovery in terms of specificity to the target when such inhibitors can only recognize the enzyme-substrate complex and therefore should not inhibit other enzymes with a similar structure.
For this reason, the presented uncompetitive inhibitors of 17β-HSD10 appear to be promising molecules for further research and development.

For HRMS determination, a Dionex UltiMate 3000 analytical LC-MS system coupled with a Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap spectrometer (both produced by ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used.
The LC-MS system consisted of a binary pump HPG-3400RS connected to a vacuum degasser, a heated column compartment TCC-3000, an autosampler WTS-3000 equipped with a 25 µL loop, and a VWD-3000 ultraviolet detector.
A Waters Atlantis dC18 100Å (2.1 × 100 mm/ 3 µm) column was used as the stationary phase.
The analytical column was protected against mechanical particles by an in-line filter (Vici Jour) with a frit with 0.5 µm pores.
Water (MFA) and acetonitrile (MFB) used in the analyses were acidified with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.
Ions for mass spectrometry were generated by heated electro-spray ionization source (HESI) working in positive mode, with the following settings: sheath gas flow rate 40, aux gas flow rate 10, sweep gas flow rate 2, spray voltage 3.2 kV, capillary temperature 350 • C, aux gas temperature 300 • C, S-lens RF level 50, microscans 1, maximal injection time 35 ms, resolution 140,000.
The full-scan MS analyses monitored ions within m/z range 100-1500.
The studied compounds were dissolved in methanol, and 1 µL of the solution was injected into the LC-MS system.
For elution, following ramp-gradient program was used: 0-1 min: 10% MFB, 1-4 min: 10-100% MFB, 4-5 min: 100% MFB, 5-7.5 min: 10% MFB.
The flow-rate in the gradient elution was set to 0.4 mL/min.
To increase the accuracy of HRMS, internal lock-mass calibration was employed using polysiloxane traces of m/z = 445.12003
(
The chromatograms and mass spectra were processed in Chromeleon 6.80 and Xcalibur 3.0.63
software, respectively (both produced by ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
Novelty of prepared final products was checked using Reaxys database (www.reaxys.com).
Three final products were found not to be novel structures (4v, 4w and 4af).
Two of those compounds, 4w
However, none of those compounds has ever been tested for inhibition of 17β-HSD10 enzyme.

The recombinant 17β-HSD10 enzyme was produced in Escherichia coli (E.
coli) BL21 (DE3) strain and purified to homogeneity.
Briefly, the DNA encoding the HSD17B10 sequence was obtained from UniProtKB server (accession number: Q99714), codon optimized for E. coli as host cells, and produced in GeneArt Synthesis service (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The enzyme coding sequence was amplified by PCR using a pair of specific primers introducing restriction endonuclease recognition sites to both ends, and the sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing (ABI Prism 3130xl).
The PCR product was subcloned into expression vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen) in frame with N-terminal hexa-histidine tag coding sequence.
The Overnight Express TM TB medium was used for enzyme autoinduction and overexpression at 25 • C for 18 h.
The bacterial cells were harvested using centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and the bacterial pellet was lysed by sonication in combination with 1 mg/mL lysozyme in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole buffer containing 150 U/mL benzonase, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).
The cleared crude lysate was loaded onto Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for affinity purification under native conditions using a hexahistidine tag.
After several washing steps with low-concentration imidazole buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole), elution with a high concentration of imidazole (250 mM imidazole) was performed.
The high concentration of imidazole in elution buffer was removed by Amicon Ultra-15 units with a 10 kDa cut-off by using buffer exchange protocol, and the protein was stored immersed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 30% glycerol at -80 • C for long-term storage.

Recombinant Protein Analyses
For the confirmation of the presence and purity of the recombinant protein, the final protein fractions were analyzed by using SDS-PAGE followed by semi-dry western blotting.
The purified recombinant protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane.
The membrane was blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and probed with mouse monoclonal antibody specific to 17β-HSD10 protein (dilution 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, sc-393693) followed by the incubation with anti-mouse binding protein conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:5000, SantaCruz Biotechnology, sc-516102).
Protein bands were visualized by the application of ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), and the images were captured using Azure c400 imaging system (Azure Biosystem, Dublin, CA, USA).
The protein concentration was determined by using a MicroBCA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).

AAC Reductase Assay and Enzyme Kinetics
The enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein was determined by using AAC as a substrate for enzyme reduction.
To determine the Michaelis constant K m and maximal rate of enzyme reaction V max , different substrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 µM were incubated with a fixed concentration of cofactor and enzyme.
The reaction readout was absorbance at 340 nm for 5 min in 20 s intervals at 37 • C. The data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and V max and K m were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using the reaction velocity and substrate concentration data.
All reactions were measured in triplicate, and the values were expressed as means ± SD.
The general reaction mixture for the reductase activity measurement consisted of 320 µM AAC, 320 µM NADH as the enzyme cofactor and 0.15 µg of recombinant enzyme in assay buffer
The process was as follows: the reaction mixture of enzyme and cofactor in assay buffer was preincubated for 5 min at 37 • C prior to substrate addition.
The reaction was performed in 96-well polystyrene plates at 37 • C (Tecan Spark 10M, Männedorf, Switzerland), and enzyme activity was recorded as the change in absorbance at 340 nm over 1 min and calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of NADH (ε = 6220 M -1 •cm -1 ).

17β-HSD10 Enzyme Inhibition Screening and IC 50 Determination
The novel compounds were screened at 10 µM or 1 µM to determine their ability to inhibit 17β-HSD10 enzyme.
The tested compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration of 10 mM and then diluted into deionized water to get the working concentration.
The inhibitory screening was based on AAC reductase assay.
The remaining enzyme activity was measured at 340 nm at 20 s intervals for 5 min and determined as the difference in absorbance between inhibited and non-inhibited enzymatic reaction.
The DMSO was used as well as the inhibitor as the vehicle control.
The potent known 17β-HSD10 inhibitor AG18051
For compounds with at least 50% 17β-HSD10 inhibition in the 10 µM screening assay, the IC 50 was determined.
For this purpose, the AAC reductase assay was used and the remaining enzyme activity was measured as dose-response inhibition with at least six different inhibitor concentrations (ranging from 0 to 3 µM) at fixed substrate, enzyme, and cofactor concentrations.
The data were analyzed by using GraphPad Prism 7 software in non-linear regression, and IC 50 values were calculated for each inhibitor from at least three independent measurements, all in triplicate.

Determination of Inhibition Type
The determination of the inhibition type for three most potent compounds was made by using an AAC reductase activity assay.
The inhibitors were used at different concentrations (0-3 µM) in combination with different substrate concentrations
The uninhibited enzymatic reaction contained the same DMSO concentration as the inhibited one and was used as the vehicle control.
For data evaluation, the linearization of Lineweaver-Burk and Hanes-Wolf was used.
To determine the binding mechanism more precisely, the K m and V max values of inhibited reactions were compared with uninhibited reactions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have prepared and in vitro evaluated over 50 novel compounds based on a benzothiazolyl urea scaffold acting as 17β-HSD10 inhibitors.
SAR study revealed crucial structural aspects required for good inhibitory potency, namely 3-chlorine and 4-hydroxy substitution on the phenyl ring, urea linker and small substituent at position 6 of the benzothiazole moiety.
The most potent inhibitors were able to inhibit 17β-HSD10 activity with IC 50 at low micromolar level, thus being ten times more potent compared to parental inhibitors.
The novel compounds were found to be uncompetitive inhibitors of 17β-HSD10 with selectivity towards the enzyme-substrate complex, which makes them interesting for further research and development as potential drugs.
