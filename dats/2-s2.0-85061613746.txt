Molecular Docking Studies of Coumarins Isolated from Extracts and Essential Oils of Zosima absinthifolia Link as Potential Inhibitors for Alzheimer’s Disease
Coumarins and essential oils are the major components of the Apiaceae family and the Zosima genus.
The present study reports anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities of extracts and essential oils from aerial parts, roots, flowers, fruits and coumarins-bergapten (1); imperatorin (2), pimpinellin (3) and umbelliferone (4)-isolated of the roots from Zosima absinthifolia.
The investigation by light and scanning electron microscopy of the structures of secretory canals found different chemical compositions in the various types of secretory canals which present in the aerial parts, fruits and flowers.
The canals, present in the aerial parts, are characterized by terpene hydrocarbons, while the secretory canals of roots, flowers and fruits include esters.
Novel data of a comparative study on essential oils constituents of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits of Z. absinthfolia has been presented.
The roots and fruits extract showed a high content of total phenolics and antioxidant activity.
The GC-FID and GC-MS analysis revealed that the main components of the aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits extracts were octanol (8.8%), octyl octanoate (7.6%), octyl acetate (7.3%); trans-pinocarvyl acetate (26.7%), β-pinene (8.9%); octyl acetate (19.9%), trans-p-menth-2-en-1-ol (4.6%); octyl acetate (81.6%), and (Z)-4-octenyl acetate (5.1%).
The dichloromethane fraction of fruit and flower essential oil was characterized by the highest phenolics level and antioxidant activity.
The dichloromethane fraction of fruit had the best inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (82.27 ± 1.97%) which was higher then acetylcholinesterase inhibition (61.09 ± 4.46%) of umbelliferone.
This study shows that the flowers and fruit of Z. absinthifolia can be a new potential resource of natural antioxidant and anticholinesterase compounds.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease and the most widespread reason for dementia.
The characteristical symptoms of dementia are troubles with memory, language, problem-solution and other cognitive abilities that influence a person's ability to make daily activities.
These troubles happen because nerve cells in parts of the brain involved in cognitive function have been ruined.
In AD, neurons in other parts of the brain are finally damaged or destroyed as well, including those that permit a person to perform basic bodily functions such as walking and swallowing.
People in the final stages of the disease are bed-bound and require around-the-clock care.
AD is eventually fatal
Many factors such as age are risk factors in AD.
Due to the ageing population, it is expected that AD will become a serious socio-economic challenge globally in the coming years
With reference to the World Health Organization data, AD, which affects about 47 million people worldwide, is the most pervasive form of dementia (60-80% of all cases)
Oxidative stress, occurring through a damage to neurons or metal accumulation has been related to the pathogenesis of AD.
Drugs endowed with anticholinesterase and antioxidant capacity could thus be useful for the prevention/treatment of AD
To overcome the limitations of current therapeutics for AD, extensive research is under way to identify drugs that are both effective and free of undesired side effects.
In this context naturally occurring dietary polyphenolic phytochemicals have received remarkable attention as alternative options for AD treatment.
In particular, curcumin, resveratrol, and green tea catechins have been identified to have the potential to prevent AD owing to their anti-amyloidogenic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory characteristics.
These polyphenolic phytochemicals also activate adaptive cellular stress responses, called 'neurohormesis', and supress illness processes
Antioxidants may trap reactive oxygen species (ROS) and break inflammatory pathways.
The utilization of antioxidants is useful to delay AD progress
A particular and important preventive action against AD with hop iso-α-acids, which are reponsible for the bitterness in beer, was discussed lately.
Besides, proof has appeared for anti-carcinogenic action from hops'prenylflavonoids, as well as from phenolic components extracted from both malt and hops
Numerous investigations were performed on the biological activities of plants which are utilised traditionally as memory enhancers and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
Representatives of the family Apiaceae demonstrate acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity
Natural compounds of phenolic nature have shown a substantial role in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE)
Phenolic compounds of medicinal plants and dietary plants are present as coumarins, curcuminoids, flavonoids, lignans, phenolic acids, tannins, stilbenes, quinones, and others.
The varied bioactivities of phenolic compounds are responsibe for their AChE inhibition capacities
At the same time, essential oils are verified to provide varied pharmacological effects, like antiflatulent, antiviral, antispasmodic, anticarcinogenic, and hepatoprotective effects, etc. Essential oils have been reported to be natural antioxidants and proffered principally as potential substitutes of synthetic antioxidants used the in food conservation sectors.
Further, biologically active natural compounds can be used in the pharmaceutical industry to check human sicknesses of microbial origin and treat lipid peroxidative damage, which is observed in certain pathological disorders, such as AD, carcinogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, coronary atherosclerosis, and ageing processes
Antioxidants comprise most of the active ingredients of the $80 billion anti-ageing product market, which is growing at >10% yearly growth rate.
Olive polyphenols-whose hydroxytyrosol and verbascoside compounds share the highest grade of antioxidant activity ever reported for any natural compound-can be effectively utilized in for health, appearance enhancement, and fitness purposes as well as in the anti-ageing products market
Representatives of the families Apiaceae and Lamiaceae are characterized by high phenolics content
Z. absinthifolia Link is the only member of the Zosima genus that grows in Turkey, where it is commonly known as 'ayı eli' or 'peynir otu'.
The aerial parts of the plant are used up as a vegetable and added to a traditional cheese in East Anatolia.
In folk medicine, fruits of the plant have digestive and sedative effects with anti-inflammatory properties.
Moreover, the aerial parts cure dyspepsia, stomach gas, cough and intestinal disorders
Coumarins, such as deltoin and columbianadin, have also been isolated from Z. absinthifolia
It has been reported that Z. absinthifolia has biological activities such as cytotoxic, antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory
Previous phytochemical studies have demonstrated that Z. absinthifolia contains alkaloids and coumarins such as deltoin, imperatorin, zosimine, pimpinellin, bergapten, isobergapten, sphondin isopimpinellin, and umbelliferone
The presented research studied the cholinesterase inhibitory, antioxidant activity, and phenolics content of the methanol, hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol and aqueous extracts and essential oils of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits of Z. absinthifolia.
The AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities of the coumarins bergapten (1), imperatorin (2), pimpinellin (3) and umbelliferone (4) isolated from the roots of Z. absinthifolia were also assessed through molecular docking studies with parallel investigation of the structures of the plant's secretory canals.

Results
The CH 3 OH extracts of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits of Zosima absinthifolia were fractionated with the use of different solvents (n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and butanol), to give the respective fractions and the individual coumarins bergapten (1), imperatorin (2), pimpinellin (3) and umbelliferone (4) isolated from roots which were assayed for antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activities.
Also, the AChE and BuChE inhibitory activities of the compounds were determined via molecular docking.
The active dichloromethane fraction of root was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel and Sephadex LH-20.
As the result, four known coumarins namely, bergapten (1)

Discussion
Coumarins are compounds naturally present in a great number of plants.
Coumarin and its derivatives are prevalent in Nature.
Coumarins are benzopyrones, which are compounds comprised of benzene rings linked to a pyrone moiety.
Human dietary exposure to benzopyrones is quite considerable, as these compounds occur in fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, and higher plants.
It has been determined that the mean Western diet includes ~1 g/day of mixed benzopyrones
Coumarins have various biological activities such as anticancer, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, antitubercular, antihyperglycemic, antiadipogenic, antifungal, antibacterial, anticonvulsant, antihypertensive, antiviral, antioxidant, neuroprotective and antidiabetic effects
In the current research, umbelliferone and pimpinellin were isolated from Zosima absinthfolia, and indicated activity against AChE and BuChE.

In the current research, umbelliferone and pimpinellin were isolated from Zosima absinthfolia, and indicated activity against AChE and BuChE.
We assumed that the inhibitory activity of umbelliferone was primary due to the hydroxyl group at the C-7 position.
Also, we assumed that the inhibitory activity of pimpinellin was primary due to the methoxy groups at the C-5 and C-6 positions.
Umbelliferone and pimpinellin presented the best activity at 20 µg/mL, while bergapten indicated weak inhibitory activity.
The roots fractions have been characterized by the significant higher content of total phenolics than aerial part fractions.
Previously, it was observed that methanol fruit extract of Z. absinthfolia showed high antioxidant activities and a greater content of total phenols in comparison to the hexane and dichloromethane extracts of the plant
A significant correlation was observed between antioxidant capacity and the total phenolics content in previous investigations
The antioxidant capacity of Z. absinthfolia plant extracts was studied.
It was found that peroxidation inhibition of MeOH extract of Z. absinthfolia was 143.5 RC 50
However, we found that, fruit CH 2 Cl 2 fraction showed higher antioxidant activity in comparison with the MeOH extract.
In a previous study, the major components of essential oils from different parts of Z. absinthfolia were studied and it was shown that the main volatile compounds were lavandulyl acetate (23.9%, an ester of the irregular monoterpenol), bornyl acetate (12.0%), octyl octanoate (11.7%), lavandulol (5.0%), octyl hexanoate (4.2%) and lavandulyl octanoate (3.1%)
Another study reported that the major components of oil from the aerial part of Z. absinthfolia were octyl acetate (32.50%), octanol (20.60%) and α-pinene (10.90%)
Octyl acetate (87.48%), octyl octanoate (5.03%) and 1-octanol (2.37%) were found the major components of fruit essential oil
Octyl acetate (38.4%) and octyl hexanoate (31.9%) were detected as major components of fruit essential oil of Z. absinthfolia
Our study is the first comparative study on essential oils constituents of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits of Z. absinthfolia and their anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities.
So far, no data are available about the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oil from Zosima genus, especially such as α-pinene and octyl acetate which in previous studies showed high antioxidant capacity
The high abundance of octyl acetate and possible antioxidative and anticancer effects were estimated in essential oils from the leaves of species of Pittosporum (Pittosporaceae)
The chemical composition of the different types of secretory canals present in the aerial parts, fruits and flowers were different.
The canals present in the aerial parts are characterized by terpene hydrocarbons, while the secretory canals of roots, flowers and fruits include esters.
Only canals of fruits contain lactones.
Besides, canals of flowers and fruits contain alkanes.
We can comment that the number of secretory channels, their location in the organs and their different shapes (broad, big, little, oval etc) could be related to the different chemical compositions of aerial part, root, flower and fruits.
The chemical class distribution of the samples is presented in Table
Members of the Apiaceae family are characterized by a specific type of essential oil secretory structure known as secretory canals.
Their shapes and numbers can vary between species, within species or even in individual plants.
They have large amounts of metabolic products in the area between their secretory canals.
Particularly they generate and store essential oils in plants
AD is a neurodegenerative disease induced by oxidative stress with a further cholinergic deprivation in the brain.
Expressly, a decrease in the amount of acetylcholine delivered from cholinergic synapses has been identified as a cause.
One cure methodology involves augmenting or protecting the ratio of acetylcholine via inhibiting acetylcholinesterase
This research indicated that the CH 2 Cl 2 fraction of fruit from Z. absinthifolia has AChE and BuChE inhibitory activity along with high antioxidant capacity.
The use of antioxidants may be useful to treat AD.
To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study on the anticholinesterase activity of extracts from Z. absinthifolia.
Essential oil components represent a diverse family of low molecular weight organic compounds with remarkable biological activity.
In accordance with their chemical structure, these active compounds can be divided into four major groups: terpenoids, phenylpropenes, terpenes, and "others".
Besides, they might include diversified functional groups in accordance with which they can be categorised as hydrocarbons (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons); oxygenated compounds (monoterpene and sesquiterpene alcohols, esters, ketones, aldehydes, and other oxygenated compounds); and sulfur and/or nitrogen sulfur including compounds (sulfides, nitriles, thioesters, isothiocyanates, and others).
Components that act as cholinesterase inhibitors still represent the only pharmacological treatment of AD.
Many in vitro investigations have demonstrated that some compounds present in essential oils such as α-pinene, αand β-asarone, δ-3-carene, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, thymohydroquinone, anethole, etc have certain cholinesterase inhibitory activity

Determination of Total Phenolics
The total phenolic content of specimens was evaluated utilising the Folin-Ciocalteu assay
The total phenolics absorbance was determined at 765 nm with the use of a Jenway UV/Vis 6405 spectrophotometer (Jenway, Chelmsford, UK).
The findings are reported as gallic acid equivalents (GAE/g specimens).

1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) Radical Scavenging Capacity Assay
The previously detailed DPPH assay
Reagent stock solution (1 × 10 -3 M) was prepared by dissolving 22 mg of DPPH in 50 mL of methanol.
This solution was kept at 20 • C until used.
Samples (0.02 g) were extracted in two steps: first, to the dry material in an Eppendorf tube was added 1 mL of distilled water.
Specimens were heated at 95 • C during 15 min and further for 5 min centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 25 • C).
The supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube.
The supernatant with 1 mL of dist.
water was diluted and the same heating and centrifugation procedure was repeated.
The study solution (6 × 10 -5 M) was prepared by mixing 100 mL of methanol with 6 mL of the stock solution.
Then, 0.1 mL of each experimental solution was mixed in to react with 3.9 mL of the solution of DPPH, followed by vortexing for 30 s and a further reaction time of 30 min.
The optical absorbance was gauged at 515 nm with the Jenway UV/Vis 6405 spectrophotometer.
A sample without DPPH solution was utilized as a blank sample.
The scavenging activity of DPPH was measured according to the formula below: Scavenging activity of DPPH (%) = [(A control -A sample)/Acontrol] × 100 where A = absorbance at 515 nm.

Anti-Lipid Peroxidation Activity
The thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay was utilised to assess the protective activity of samples on liposomes against lipid peroxidation
Seven different sample concentrations (0.016-1 mg/mL) were studied in this test.
Chlorogenic acid, rutin and propyl gallate were prepared as reference compounds at seven different concentrations (0.000064-1 mg/mL), and chlorogenic acid and rutin were utilised in the same concentration interval.
Brain extract (0.2 mL), phosphate buffer (0.5 mL), ferric chloride (0.1 mL), ascorbic acid (0.1 mL) and the samples were mixed and incubated at 37 • C for 20 minutes.
Next, 25% HCl (0.5 mL), 1% TBA (0.5 mL) and 2% BHT (0.1 mL) were added into the mixture, which was shaken and incubated at 85 • C for 30 minutes.
The mixture was cooled and n-butanol (2.5 mL) was added.
After centrifugation, the absorbance of the samples was recorded at 532 nm using the UV-1800 spectrophotometer.
These tests were repeated four times.
The IC 50 values were established through linear regression analysis.
A low IC 50 value means that the antioxidant activity is high.

Determination of AChE and BuChE Inhibition Activities
The determination of AChE and BuChE inhibition activities of the samples were performed according to
This process was repeated three times for each plate.
All data were expressed as mean ± SE of three independent assays.

Microscopic Analysis
Materials (kept in 70% alcohol) from Zosima absinthifolia were assessed by light microscopy using Sartur and chloral hydrate reagents.
In the light microscopy study, cross-sections of peduncles, rays, pedicels, and fruits from Z. absinthifolia were prepared manually.
Images prepared with Sartur R
In the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations, leaf, stem, pedicel and fruit parts were attached to aluminium stubs and covered with gold for 4 min in a sputter-coater.
Morphological observations were done in a Jeol JSM 6490LV scanning electron microscope at the Turkish Petroleum International Company (TPAO) Research Centre SEM laboratory, Ankara.

Molecular Docking Studies
Umbelliferone was found to be an active compound against AChE and pimpinellin was found to be active against BuChE was found.
These active compounds were docked at the binding sites of 1-EVE and 1-P0I.

Protein Preparation
The three-dimensional complex structures of AChE (PDB ID: 1EVE) and BuChE (PDB ID: 1P0I) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank
The protein structures were prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard panel tool of the Scrödinger software suite (Maestro 11.8).
Firstly water molecules (>5Å radius) and other small molecules were removed from the crystal structures, hydrogen atoms were added and physiological pH was set at 7. Finally, the restrained minimization was performed with the added hydrogen atoms to OPLS3e.

Ligand Preparation
The ligands were prepared for docking with using the Ligand Preparation Panel in the programme.
The grid files were created using the Receptor Grids Generation Panel.
Finally the Glide Ligand Docking Panel was used for docking studies.

Statistical Analysis
All findings are stated as mean ± SE and variations between means were statistically analyzed through One-way analysis of ANOVA followed via Bonferroni's complementary analysis, with p < 0.05 considered to demonstrate statistical significancy.

Conclusions
The CH 2 Cl 2 fraction of fruit from Zosima absinthifolia and umbelliferone had a remarkable antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities.
The tested extracts and essential oils displayed high radical scavenging capacity (RSC), which was found to be in correlation to their content of phenolic compounds.
Octyl acetate was the dominant component in the essential oils.
Original information has been presented regarding the total phenolics content and high presence of chlorogenic acid and flavonoid rutin in the extracts and essential oils of plant Z. absinthifolia.
Novel data of a comparative study on the essential oil constituents of aerial parts, roots, flowers and fruits of Z. absinthfolia has shown different phenolic compositions which can depend from the function of secretory canals of the various plant parts.
Due to the remarkable presence of compounds with high anticholinesterase activities in the plant we presume that Z. absinthifolia could be utilised as an herbal alternative to synthetic drugs in the prophylaxis of AD.
