Hydrolase and p38 Kinase Intervenes in Alzheimer's Signaling in Human Nerve Cells
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder.
Neuroinflammation is a prevalent pathogenic stress leading to neuronal death in AD.
Targeting neuroinflammation to keep neurons alive is an attractive strategy for AD therapy.
1-Trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) is a potent inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and can enter into the brain.
It has a good efficacy on a wide range of chronic inflammatory diseases in preclinical animal models.
However, the anti-neuroinflammatory effects and molecular mechanisms of TPPU for potential AD interventions remain elusive.
With an aim to develop multi-target therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, we screened TPPU against sEH from different vertebrate species and a broad panel of human kinases in vitro for potential new targets relevant to neuroinflammation in AD.
TPPU inhibits both human sEH and p38β kinase, two key regulators of inflammation, with nanomolar potencies and distinct selectivity.
To further elucidate

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is the fifth leading cause of global deaths.
To date, no effective drugs can prevent, cure, or even slow this devastating disease.
AD arises from a complexity of multi-faceted mechanisms, including amyloid neurotoxicity, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, synaptic loss, and ultimate death of neurons in the brain of AD patients.
3]
flammation associated with neurodegenerative conditions is a prevalent cellular stress in AD.
The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has been implicated in many chronic inflammatory conditions.
9] The sEH is responsible for the conversion of epoxy fatty acids to their corresponding diols in lipid signaling pathways.
In the arachidonic acid cascade, sEH hydrolyzes epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs).
EETs are known to mediate vascular relaxation responses and possess antiinflammatory activities via attenuating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress in vivo,
] Therefore, sEH inhibition can increase the endogenous concentration of EETs, leading to mitigation of inflammation.
In recent years, there is ample evidence proving the therapeutic effects of sEH inhibitors in many rodent models for neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with inflammation such as stroke, seizure, depression, autism, and Parkinson's disease.
14]
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are another key regulator responsive to a variety of cellular stresses, and the p38 MAPK signaling plays an important role in neuroinflammation.
Previous studies revealed that p38 kinases are abnormally active in glial cells of AD brains, which enhances inflammatory gene expression and upregulates proinflammatory cytokines.
8] In addition, an elevated p38 kinase activity in neurons contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation and tau-mediated neuroinflammation in AD.
With a goal of developing novel therapeutics to target neuroinflammation for AD, we here tested a hypothesis that simultaneously modulating sEH and p38 MAPK pathways in neurons by a urea-based inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU), would provide synergistic outcomes of neuroprotection.
TPPU (Figure
Prior studies have shown that TPPU is effective in several animal models of neurological diseases.
10, 13-16 Given that the urea-based scaffold is a key pharmacophore in many inhibitors of sEH and protein kinases,
Such dual inhibitory properties of TPPU and the resulting pharmacological effects have not been previously investigated.
We recently established a cell model of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity using differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, which is specifically associated with AD.
The results support the studies of TPPU and development of new dual inhibitors of sEH/p38β kinase for potential AD therapy.

RESULTS

TPPU is a Potent Inhibitor Selectively Targeting Primate and Rodent sEHs.
We previously demonstrated that TPPU is a slow and tight-binding inhibitor showing a high target occupancy with the sEH.
It is highly potent to human and mouse sEHs.
To further elaborate its species selectivity, we screened TPPU against sEHs in liver S-9 fractions from different mammals, including human, monkey, mouse, rat, dog, and mini-pig (Table
The results substantiated that TPPU is a potent and selective inhibitor for primate and rodent sEHs.
Particularly, it has IC 50 values less than 50 nM for the human, monkey and rat sEH, and an IC 50 of 90 nM for the mouse sEH.
In contrast, TPPU is relatively less potent for the dog and mini pig sEHs with IC 50 values of 1800 nM and 220 nM, respectively.

TPPU Selectively Inhibits Kinase Activities of p38β and p38γ Isoforms.
Many urea-based compounds have been developed to target kinases because they can mimic ATP to block phosphate transfer in kinase-catalyzed reactions.
5]
With an aim at investigating whether TPPU could be a multi-target therapeutic for AD intervention, we screened TPPU at 1 μM against 40 human kinases (Figure
In contrast, its inhibitory effects on p38α and p38δ isoforms were not significant.
The results indicate a good isoform-selectivity of TPPU to p38β (IC 50 , 270 nM) and p38γ (IC 50 , 890 nM) where p38β is the most selective (approximately 3.3fold over p38γ) (Figure
TPPU weakly inhibited a handful of kinases such as GSK-3β, AMPKA2, and CK1α1 in comparison with p38β.

SH-SY5Y Human Nerve Cells are a Valid Neuronal Model for the Study of sEH and p38 MAPK.
SH-SY5Y Human neuroblastoma cells are commonly used for the study of neurodegenerative diseases in vitro because they can be differentiated with morphological, biochemical, and functional features resembling human mature neurons.
] Western blotting on a whole-cell lysate showed that differentiated SH-SY5Y cells express a reasonable level of sEH and p38β kinase (Figure
Treatment of TPPU (10, 100 and 1000 nM) to the cells for 24 h significantly decreased cellular sEH activities in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
The results indicated that SH-SY5Y cells were a valid in vitro cell model suitable for the present study.

TPPU Protects Neurite Outgrowth against Aβ 42 Neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells.
Chronic Aβ exposure in neuronal cells triggers AD-mimic pathologies such as tau hyperphosphorylation, Ca 2+ homeostatic dysregulation, activation of MAPK-linked toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, production of inflammatory proteins, and the ultimate loss of neuronal integrity.
32] Because SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells express functional sEH and p38β kinase as well as mature tau isoforms with proper neuronal distribution in microtubules,
The results showed that treatment with 10 μM Aβ 42 induced detrimental changes in neuronal morphology as many dying and nondifferentiated cells with retracted neurites in comparison to the untreated control (Figure
However, pretreatment of 100 nM TPPU effectively relieved Aβ 42 toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure
TPPU-treated cells maintained a healthy neuronal morphology for which they were well differentiated with extended neurites.
Besides, the TPPU-treated cells tend to have a more pyramidal shaped soma and become distinctly polarized.
The cells also had longer and branched neurites and a detectable neuronal network in comparison to the control cells (Figure
Being consistent with our prior study in the rat primary sensory and cortical neurons,
Because sEH is predominantly localized to axons in mature neurons, its inhibition could regulate bioactive EETs to induce axonal regeneration and outgrowth.
Moreover, maintaining healthy tau-microtubule interactions via intervening the p38 MAPK pathway by TPPU could synergistically contribute to neurite outgrowth.

TPPU and EETs Prevent Aβ-induced Cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells.
To demonstrate that TPPU exerts neuroprotection against Aβ neurotoxicity, the cell viability assay was conducted.
TPPU alone was tolerable and nontoxic to SH-SY5Y cells up to a dose at 1000 nM (Figure
Treatment with 10 μM Aβ 42 decreased cell viability to 30% in comparison with the control cells (Figure
In contrast, pretreated cells with varying concentrations of TPPU ranging from 0.1 to 1000 nM for 1 h followed by 10 μM Aβ 42 coincubation for 72 h regained cell viability from 30% to 100% in a dose-dependent manner.
TPPU showed an effective neuroprotection with an EC 50 value of 48.6 nM (Figure
EETs are lipid metabolites and substrates of sEH.
Our previous investigations demonstrated that EETs are neuroprotective and are capable of stimulating axonogenesis in rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells
In the present study, treatment of TPPU stimulated the SH-SY5Y cell proliferation (Figure
Cotreatment of EETs and TPPU at 0.1 μM significantly increased cell proliferation by approximately 30% (p < 0.0001) (Figure
Our results also demonstrated that pretreatment of either 0.1 μM EETs or 0.1 μM TPPU alone for 1 h followed by 10 μM Aβ 42 exposure for 72 h showed effective neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y cells (p < 0.0001).
As expected, cotreatment of 0.1 μM EETs with 0.1 μM TPPU showed an enhanced effect that almost fully protected cell viability.

Pairwise Treatment of Selective Inhibitors of sEH and p38 Kinase Synergizes Neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y Cells.
To further prove that TPPU is a dual inhibitor and simultaneous inhibition of both sEH and p38β kinase would result in a synergistic neuroprotection, we conducted a drug combination screening.
A selective sEH inhibitor (t-AUCB) and a selective p38α/β kinase inhibitor (SB202190) were cotreated in a pairwise manner in SH-SY5Y cells under Aβ 42 exposure.
It is noteworthy that t-AUCB is a very potent urea-based sEH inhibitor (IC 50 , 2 nM) structurally distinct from TPPU.
t-AUCB neither inhibits p38 MAPKs nor other kinases.
24, 34 SB202190 is a potent p38α/β inhibitor (IC 50 , 50 nM) capable of blocking MAPK pathways in cells.
6] The combination effects of the two compounds were then assessed by the cell viability assay according to a screening method described by He et al.
In parallel, when t-AUCB at 0.1 nM, treatment of SB202190 from 1 to 1000 nM increased neuroprotection in a dose-dependent manner as well.
However, at the highest dosage tested, t-AUCB (100 nM) showed only a 27.3% neuroprotection, while SB202190 (1000 nM) was about 37.5%.
Interestingly, an analysis on the combination dose-response matrices revealed that cotreatment of both compounds at certain ratios dramatically improved neuroprotection at different levels (e.g., cotreatment of t-AUCB at 1 nM with SB202190 at 1000 nM resulted in a 54.3% neuroprotection), which is a typical synergistic effect.
The data provide a compelling evidence that simultaneous inhibition against both sEH and p38β MAPK would offer synergistic benefits for potential AD therapy.

TPPU Attenuates Tau Hyperphosphorylation Induced by Aβ 42 in SH-SY5Y Cells.
Aβ oligomers directly bind to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE)
Given that TPPU selectively inhibits p38β kinase in vitro (Figure
The tau phosphorylation level at the site S396 was monitored because it is a pathologic p-tau site in AD and is known to be susceptible to p38 MAPK.
Figure
Conversely, pretreatment of TPPU (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM) in the cells significantly mitigated the Aβ 42 -induced tau phosphorylation levels at the site pS396 in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.0001).
To determine whether such remedy on tau hyperphosphorylation is due to the p38β inhibition by TPPU, we used a selective p38α/β inhibitor SB202190 as a reference control in the cellular assay.
The results demonstrated that TPPU is pharmacologically equivalent to SB202190 in terms of the outcome on p-tau alleviation, which implies the p38β inhibition by TPPU in the cells.
In addition, the data showed that TPPU (0.01 μM) possesses a stronger alleviative effect on tau hyperphosphorylation than that of SB202190 at a 5-fold higher dosage level (0.05 μM).

TPPU and EETs Prevent Aβ-induced Depolarization of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.
Aβ oligomers induce oxidative stress by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activate proinflammatory genes, which cause mitochondrial dysfunction.
To assess the protective effects of TPPU on mitochondrial integrity and function against Aβ toxicity, the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ m ) in SH-SY5Y human nerve cells were measured with a JC 10 assay.
In this assay, the JC-10 dyes generate red-fluorescent aggregates (Em = 590 nm) within the healthy mitochondria upon membrane polarization.
However, if mitochondria dysfunctions, the dyes will be released in a greenfluorescent monomer form (Em = 525 nm) through the collapsed/depolarized mitochondrial membrane.
Because TPPU protected Aβ 42 -induced neurotoxicity with an EC 50 value of 48.6 nM (Figure
As shown in Figure
Such a deficit of mitochondrial membrane induced by Aβ 42 was similar to that of a reference compound FCCP, a known ionophore capable of depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane.
Conversely, cells pretreated with TPPU for 1 h followed by 10 μM Aβ 42 treatment for 72 h significantly decreased fluorescence ratios of 525/590 nm in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.0001), indicating the apparent protection of mitochondrial integrity against Aβ 42 in the cells.
To determine whether sEH is critical in regulating Δψ m for mitochondrial integrity, we assayed the sEH substrate, EETs, in SH-SY5Y cells.
The data substantiated the effect that pretreatment with EETs at 0.1 μM attenuated the loss of Δψ m induced by Aβ 42 (p < 0.001) in SH-SY5Y cells, and cotreatment of 0.1 μM TPPU with 0.1 μM EETs synergistically restored Δψ m to normal levels against Aβ 42 toxicity (p < 0.0001).
Our data agreed with the other studies that EETs protect mitochondrial functions in rat hippocampal astrocytes.
The results collectively suggest that sEH inhibition by TPPU or treatment with EETs results in prevention from Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y nerve cells.

TPPU Suppresses Activation and Nuclear Translocation of the Transcription Factor NF-κB in SH-SY5Y Cells.
The transcription factor NF-κB is a master regulator of inflammatory responses.
Aβ oligomers destabilize beneficial epoxy fatty acids like EETs and activate p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathways in neurons and glial cells,
7] NF-κB is inactive in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins.
Upon activation by p38 MAPK phosphorylation, the homo-or heterodimeric complexes of NF-κB will release and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate proinflammatory gene expression.
Given TPPU being a potent inhibitor of both sEH and p38 kinase, we evaluated the effects on perturbation of the p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling in response to Aβ 42 stimuli in SH-SY5Y cells.
Aβ 42 at 5 μM significantly increased nuclear concentrations of all five subunits of NF-κB (p50, p52, p65, RelB, and c-Rel) in SH-SY5Y cells after 8 h (Figure
In particular, the nuclear p50 and p65 quantities were approximately 7.8-fold and 12.8-fold, respectively, higher than those of the untreated controls, while the nuclear p52, RelB, and c-Rel were approximately 3 to 5-fold more concentrated in the Aβ 42 treated cells.
Conversely, TPPU at 0.05 and 0.1 μM inhibited nuclear translocation of all five subunits (p < 0.0001), and particularly significant for p65.
To determine whether TPPU blocking NF-κB activation is due to the p38β kinase inhibition, we used dexamethasone (DEX) as a reference control that has been reported to inhibit both p38 MAPK and NF-κB.
The effects of TPPU on suppressing activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB were comparable to DEX at 0.1 μM.

DISCUSSION
The sEH and p38 MAPKs are key mediators in inflammatory processes.
sEH plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of lipid epoxides such as EETs.
The cytochrome P450-epoxide hydrolase axis is clinically relevant to inflammatory responses.
Therefore, sEH has implicated in many human inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, ischemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cancer, neuropathic pain, and neurodegenerative disorders.
p38 MAPKs are responsive to cellular stresses such as ROS, LPS, cytokines, UV light, DNA damage, and heat/osmotic shock.
In AD, toxic Aβ oligomers bind to certain receptors such as RAGE and nAChR in brain cells, thereby stimulating abnormal activation of p38 MAPK signaling,
hese collective pathological events are believed to be the key elements of the amyloid cascade in AD.
TPPU was originally developed as a urea-based sEH inhibitor to reduce inflammatory and neuropathic pain.
The pharmacological efficacy of TPPU has been demonstrated in many preclinical animal models, including mice, rats, dogs, and non-human primates with chronic inflammatory conditions.
48]
TPPU selectively targets primate sEH with a low nanomolar potency (human, IC 50 = 45 nM; monkey, IC 50 = 16 nM), whereas its potencies in other vertebrate species are relatively weaker (Table
The fine-tuned ADMET profiles and the blood-brain barrier permeability of TPPU make it as a suitable CNS drug candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.
]
To answer above scientific questions, we used differentiated SH-SY5Y human cells as a defined nerve cell model of AD because they express functional sEH and p38β kinase that are of interest in our study (Figure
The results support our hypothesis that TPPU is a potent dual inhibitor of human sEH and human p38β kinase.
Treatment of TPPU alone or a drug combination using t-AUCB (sEH inhibitor) plus SB202190 (p38α/β inhibitor) exerts a synergistic neuroprotection against Aβ toxicity (Figure
In addition, TPPU being a p38β kinase inhibitor can alleviate tau hyperphosphorylation and maintain healthy tau -microtubule association for neuronal differentiation and axonogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells.
Although both p38 MAPK and GSK-3β are tau protein kinases,
Mitochondria are the primary energy source crucial for the viability of human cells.
Their dysfunction has been implicated in many disease conditions ranging from cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases to neurodegenerative disorders.
n AD, toxic Aβ oligomers increase oxidative stress and ER stress, impair mitochondrial function, and trigger programmed cell death of neurons.
Particularly in mitochondria, Aβ causes formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores and disrupts the electron transport chain, consequently leading to the pathological ROS generation.
Such ROS feeds back to exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction.
As shown in Figure
Additionally, the p38β inhibition by TPPU might contribute to reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress downstream of the AD signaling pathway (Figure
These data collectively suggest that sEH/p38β dual inhibitors could be a potential therapy in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis and preventing AD.
They also support a hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a pathological increase of ROS levels, a feedback loop of ROS on mitochondria, and the shift in the ER stress response from cell homeostasis to inflammatory status.
odulating the mitochondrial-ROS-ER stress axis by sEH/p38β dual inhibitors is an attractive strategy for treating AD.
Importantly, the results indicate that TPPU shows an effect to mitigate neuroinflammation.
By inhibiting p38 MAPK, TPPU effectively suppresses activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB responsive to amyloid stimuli (Figure
Such anti-inflammatory properties could also be reinforced through inhibition of neuronal sEH to stabilize the endogenous EETs level.
While all of the primary targets of EETs are still unknown, increasing evidence shows that EETs inhibit ER/oxidative stresses and NF-κB activation to modulate inflammatory responses in cells.
the other hand, it has become apparent that toxic p-tau oligomers can spread through extracellular vesicles from neurons to astrocytes and microglia, and in turn trigger release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in gliosis, thereby aggravating chronic neuroinflammation.
ce elevated p38 MAPK activity is prone to increase tauopathy in neurons, inhibition of p38β kinase by TPPU may help reduce tau-mediated neuroinflammation in the brain.
As illustrated above, TPPU intervenes the canonical amyloid cascade of AD, offering multiple benefits in alleviating neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, and eventual death of neurons.
A plausible proposal of neuroprotective mechanisms of TPPU against AD is summarized in Figure
Since no disease-modifying therapies for AD have been approved by the US-FDA, investigating drug candidates with a dual inhibitory function targeting both sEH and p38 MAPK may offer a great promise to find effective AD treatment.
Neuroinflammation is a prominent feature in most neurodegenerative diseases including AD, where sEH and p38 MAPK regulate distinct but separate inflammatory pathways.
] Interestingly, TPPU being a urea-based smallmolecule inhibitor shows a good selectivity to p38β kinase over the other three isoforms (i.e., p38α, p38δ, and p38γ).
The p38 isoform-selectivity of TPPU is particularly advantageous for which it would potentially reduce the risk of off-target effects of a drug.
In fact, a p38α kinase selective inhibitor, neflamapimod (VX-745),
While TPPU shows approximately 3-fold selectivity to p38β over p38γ, it serves as a promising drug lead for developing new selective sEH/p38β dual inhibitors through medicinal chemistry approaches in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
The present study in conjunction with the prior evidence gives new insights into an investigational small-molecule inhibitor, TPPU, for potential AD therapy.
We conducted in vitro enzymatic assay screening to identify new targets of TPPU and then functionally validated in a cell model of AD, with a primary aim at understanding the molecular mechanisms and pharmacology of TPPU in human nerve cells.
The present investigation supports the argument that sEH plays a key role in AD pathology and is a novel target worth pursuing.
The new findings of TPPU regarding the dual inhibitory properties, the molecular and cellular mechanisms, as well as our curated knowledge in sEH biochemistry and pharmacology would pave a road for developing new selective sEH/p38β dual inhibitors with improved blood-brain barrier permeability via structure-based drug design and optimization for potential therapies in AD and related neurodegenerative diseases.
Notwithstanding, because different brain cells may have distinct drug responses, it would be interesting to expand the study to microglia and astrocytes as they are the main contributors of neuroinflammation.
In addition, it remains essential to conduct in vivo pharmacological studies of TPPU to ascertain its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory outcomes as well as its target engagement in preclinical animal models of AD in the future.

Liver S9 fractions were diluted with sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to ensure that the activity was in the linear range of the assay (< 20% hydrolysis of the substrate).
The enzyme activity was measured with [ 3 H]trans-diphenylpropene oxide (t-DPPO) as a substrate as described previously.
To 100 μL of diluted extract, 1 μL of inhibitor solution in DMSO was added ([I] final = 2.5 to 10000 nM).
The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min.
The enzymatic reaction was started by adding 1 μL of t-DPPO ([S] final = 50 μM).

Cell Culture and Differentiation.
An SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC CRL-2266; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) was cultured in 1:1 (v/v) DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics including penicillin and streptomycin.
Cell cultures with three to four passages were used for the experiments in compliance with ATCC recommendation.
After reaching 70-80% confluence, cells were subcultured on poly-D-lysine plates with 10 μM retinoic acid in a reduced serum media (1% FBS) to induce postmitotic differentiation.

The cells were incubated under regular culture conditions for attachment.
After 24 h of plating, the cells were pretreated with different concentrations of test chemicals or a vehicle control for 1 h following coincubation with 5 or 10 μM Aβ 42 during a desired time period.

Anti-Aβ 42 Neurotoxicity Assay and Neuronal Morphology Analysis.
The assay procedure was previously described.
8] SH-SY5Y cells were treated with chemicals in a 96-well plate under the culture condition described above.
Staurosporine at 1 μM was used as a reference control for cytotoxicity, while 0.05 μM SB202190 was used as a reference control for p38 inhibition.
After experimental treatment for 72 h, the cells were subjected to microscopic analyses of neuronal morphology and a CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation MTS assay according to the manufacturer's instruction.
Cell viability was normalized by comparing the colorimetric intensity of nontreated control cells in the MTS assay (100% viability) with that of the solvent blank without cell culture (0% viability).
The neuroprotection curve was normalized as the percentage of the cell viability relative to the nontreated control (100%) and 10 μM Aβ 42 treatment (0%) and was analyzed by four-parameter regression.
Samples were analyzed in duplicate in six independent experiments (n = 6).

Western Blotting.
The differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with phosphate protein extraction buffer (20 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , pH 7.4, 115 mM NaCl) containing 1 mM PMSF and a protease inhibitor cocktail.
Concentrations of the harvested proteins were determined by a BioSpec-nano.
Equal amounts of total proteins for each sample (10 μg per lane) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes.
The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA overnight and hybridized with primary antibodies against EPHX2, p38β MAPK, or β-actin at room temperature for 2 h.
After washes, the membranes were incubated with corresponding alkaline phosphataseconjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, and the immunoreactive bands were detected by the BCIP/NBT reagent.
Densitometric analysis was performed on three independent samples per experiment (n = 3).

Anti-Tau Hyperphosphorylation ELISA Analysis.
