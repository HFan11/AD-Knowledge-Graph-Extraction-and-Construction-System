Metabolic correlates of prevalent mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome
Introduction: Disruption of metabolic function is a recognized feature of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
We sought to determine whether similar metabolic pathways are implicated in adults with Down syndrome (DS) who have increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
We examined peripheral blood from 292 participants with DS who completed baseline assessments in the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) using untargeted mass spectrometry (MS).
Our sample included 38 individuals who met consensus criteria for AD (DS-AD), 43 who met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (DS-MCI), and 211 who were cognitively unaffected and stable (CS).
We measured relative abundance of 8,805 features using MS and 180 putative metabolites were differentially expressed (DE) among the groups at false discovery

INTRODUCTION
Down syndrome (DS) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting more than 250,000 individuals in the United States.

is strongly suggests that factors in addition to increasing A accumulation are involved in individual trajectories of AD in DS (DS-AD).
Several metabolic pathways have been implicated as modifiers of AD risk in the neurotypical population including inflammation and immune response,
Alterations in these same metabolic pathways are also characteristic of people with DS and there is growing appreciation of the role of inflammation,
Several genes on Ch21 including S100, SOD1, PIGP, and BACH1 are linked to these metabolic pathways and may also contribute to DS-AD risk beyond that directly due to A accumulation.
Further, early accumulation of A may lead to dysregulation of these and other pathways, which may modify individual DS-AD trajectories in ways to accelerate or delay symptom onset.
Deep metabolomic analysis of people with DS can capture alterations in these and other metabolic pathways that serve to modify trajectories of risk and resilience.
There is now great interest in developing early biomarkers of preclinical AD to identify those at highest risk for developing late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and to determine when to intervene when effective therapies become available.

Regarding A, results from blood biomarker studies generally show higher A levels in people with DS compared to neurotypical controls,
Many studies show higher A levels in DS-AD relative to non-demented individuals with DS
With the overexpression of APP from birth, A levels may not be as informative for diagnosis or predicting onset of clinical symptoms in DS as in the neurotypical population.
Given that most people with DS will develop AD, the main role of a biomarker (or combination of biomarkers) is to inform when symptoms are most likely to begin.
Metabolomic analysis may be ideally suited to answering this question in the case of DS-AD because the time course of biological processes measured by metabolomic analysis is much shorter than proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic or epigenomic levels and thus may be a more accurate representation of the current phenotypic state.
rthermore, because small molecule end products of metabolism are most proximate to the clinical phenotype, they may more accurately reflect small changes in pathobiology that affect the phenotype.
date, there have been some metabolomic biomarker studies applied to DS and most have focused on characterizing the metabolome of younger individuals with DS, including children.
Caracausi et al. found increased levels of key metabolites involved in mitochondrial metabolism including pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, lactate, and formate, that were generally consistent with the 3:2 gene dosage model of trisomy21.
These findings in a pediatric DS sample are provocative because they suggest chronic alterations of cellular energy metabolism in DS, which may contribute to A accumulation and produce individual trajectories of DS-AD over the lifespan.
In a cross-sectional study, Borelli et   31), but an age-related increase in several glycomic features suggesting accelerated aging in DS.
They also suggest that altered glycosylation may be associated with DS-AD, given the age-related risk of DS-AD.
However, this study did not examine this directly.
In a third study by our group,
We found higher levels of lactate, pyruvic acid, and methyladipic acid in addition to lower levels of uridine in the participants with DS-AD relative to participants with DS, but without AD.
We consider these findings in adults with DS-AD an extension of those from Caracausi et al. in children with DS.
Together, both studies suggest that disruption of energy metabolism, particularly mitochondrial metabolism, is a prominent feature of DS and DS-AD.
Here, we sought to examine the metabolic differences that characterize stages of cognitive and functional impairment over the course of DS-AD, from cognitively stable, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to DS-AD.
We hypothesized that the pathobiology of DS-AD and LOAD overlap significantly in a final common pathway that includes cellular energy metabolism.
We predicted that metabolic alterations of DS-AD progression would be similar to those seen in LOAD.
Characteristics of the participants can be found in Table

METHODS

Participants

Blood collection and processing
All blood collection and processing methods were harmonized across all ABC-DS sites.
Venous blood was collected from the median to MS for all samples was <2 years.

Untargeted UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS metabolomics
We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography electro-spray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS;Xevo-G2 QTOF, Waters Corporation) based data acquisi-tion for untargeted metabolomic profiling as described in our previous work.
Briefly, we prepared plasma samples for MS by solvent extraction and resolved using reverse phase chromatography on an Acquity UPLC (Waters Corp.) online with a QTOF-MS in the positive and negative electrospray mode with optimized run parameters.
A total of 8805 features (4790 ESI+ detection mode; 4015 ESI-detection mode) representing putative metabolites were identified by massto-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (RT) after processing of raw spectral data using XCMS software.
We submitted these putative metabolites to differential expression (DE) analysis.
A subset of relevant metabolites were identified using tandem MS.

STATISTICAL METHODS

Differential expression analysis of metabolite features
We used R version 3.6.1 and the limma package to assess DE of individual metabolites as a function of clinical status (CS/DS-MCI/DS-AD).
Individual F-statistics were derived for each metabolite feature passing quality control thresholding as we have implemented previously.
cause metabolomic abundance measurements are often positively skewed, we logarithm transformed abundance values prior to analysis consistent with other applications of surrogate variable analysis (SVA).
Resulting F-test statistic P-values were false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected to reduce the multiple testing burden, resulting in a corresponding q-value.
An FDR q < 0.05 was considered significantly DE.
We quantified the magnitude of group-wise DE as the logarithm of the group-wise fold change provided by the limma function topTableF().
Because fold change is only capable of representing pairwise comparisons, we explicitly make note of the groups compared for the remainder of this article when necessary.
We also explicitly indicate the reference condition (eg, CS, DS-MCI) from which fold-change comparisons are made.

Parametrization of nuisance variability in the peripheral metabolome
In addition to metabolite variability attributable to disease progression, the plasma metabolome is likely to reflect physiological processes and technical artefacts unrelated to neurological disease.
This is a challenge because (1) these confounding factors have the potential to limit reproducibility of differential expression findings and (2) the identity and number of these variables may be incompletely known a priori.
We have previously proposed and employed SVA to approximate these confounders (eg, due to sample age, analytical batch, medication status) in high-dimensional metabolomic data.
used the "be" method
Because APOE 4 carrier status was significantly disproportionate among the three groups ( 2 = 6.52,
P < .05),
and 4 may impact peripheral metabolic processes related to dementia in DS,

Metabolite set enrichment analysis of LC-MS metabolites
We used the Mummichog software library to generate statistical inferences regarding metabolic pathway alterations in the DS-AD participants.
To minimize false positives, we used the most recent Mummichog 2 software, which enforces RT matching across putatively related mass features (personal communication; Dr. Shuzhao Li 9/2018).
We specified instrument accuracy as 7 ppm.
Significance thresholds for DE calling were selected over the list of all nominal Pvalues generated by the preceding DE analysis.
In all comparisons for metabolite set enrichment analyses, we considered a nominal P-value < .05 to be DE.

Machine learning classifier models for group prediction
We submitted all metabolite features found to be significantly DE at the q < .05
level per pairwise contrast to predictive modelling.
To integrate surrogate variable derived information into our modelling analysis and maximally leverage available data, we took an empirical Bayesian approach (ie, empiricalBayesLM in the R package WGCNA)
and residualized all metabolite abundances by their corresponding sample-level loadings on each SV.
This resulted in an augmented metabolite expression matrix free of nuisance variability attributable to each of the 25 SVs parametrized here.
These data were further log transformed, quantile normalized, and adjusted to have unit variance and zero mean (ie, z-scaled, autoscaled).
is possible that choices in machine learning algorithm and to yield overoptimistic estimates of model strength.
In the case of our modeling efforts contrasting DS-MCI and DS-AD, we found the FDR-significant feature space to be small (ie, 17 features) and thus unsuitable for LASSO-regularized variable selection.
In this case, we prioritized a subset of these features using a linear SVM-based approach.

Targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics
We used multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM MS/MS) targeted analysis of the putatively identified metabolites selected by LASSO and SVM feature selection algorithms.
Briefly, we mixed plasma samples (25 l) with 300 l of methanol: chloroform (2:1).
To this, we added 100 l of water and chloroform, separately.
The samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 minutes.
We centrifuged the samples at 13,000 rpm at 60 • C for 15 minutes.
The upper aqueous layer was transferred to a separate vial and dried under a stream of nitrogen.
We reconstituted the samples in ACN:water

RESULTS

Plasma metabolites are differentially expressed as a function of cognitive status
We identified 8,805 putative metabolites across negative and positive mode LC-MS analyses.
We found no DE features comparing the CS and DS-MCI groups under the multiple testing correction (all FDR q > .05; Figure
This contrast was consequently not considered a candidate for further classification modeling.
However, a total of 180 features were DE at the FDR q < .05
level across the pairwise DS-MCI versus DS-AD, and CS versus DS-AD contrasts (Figure

Differentially expressed metabolite features predict cognitive status
In the case of the DS-AD versus CS contrast, 163 features FDR q < .05
were submitted to LASSO-regularized regression modelling using 10fold CV.
Considering only the subset of features selected over at least 50% of resampling epochs, the algorithm selected nine metabolites Figure
Classification accuracy for the 100-fold Monte Carlo CV was 78.1% (Figure
Our MS approach was untargeted in nature meaning that definitive identification of the metabolites selected for the classification models is necessary.
Using the tandem LC-MS/MS technique we were able to definitely identify seven of the nine features in the DS-AD versus CS contrast andtwo of the five features in the DS-AD versus DS-MCI contrast (Table
Classification models using the smaller metabolite sets of definitely identified metabolites (n = 7 and n = 2) produced ROC performance characteristics that did not differ significantly from the models using the putatively identified metabolites (Figure

Differentially expressed LC-MS metabolites underscore role of energy and lipid metabolism in DS-AD progression
Although we were able to form effective, robust classifiers of cognitive status for (1) DS-AD versus CS and (2) DS-AD versus DS-MCI comparisons, the underlying biochemical perturbations driving this discriminability could only be inferred from the few definitively identified metabolites included in the classifier models.
Furthermore, it was not clear whether semantic biological meaning could be distilled from the DS-MCI versus CS contrast in spite of a lack of FDR q <
.05 significant features.
To evaluate this, all DE features on the basis of group-wise DE nominal P-values were putatively identified based on m/z and mobile phase column RT.
We submitted these features to metabolic set enrichment analysis for high-level semantic characterization and systems biochemical interpretation.
Corroborating earlier reports from our group in an independent cohort of DS adults, we again find that known metabolic pathways involved in fatty acid/lipid metabolism and central carbon/carbohydrate metabolism appear perturbed in peripheral blood plasma with dementia progression (Table
Interestingly, metabolic pathways characterizing contiguous phenotype transitions (ie, CS vs DS-MCI and DS-AD vs DS-MCI) appear particularly enriched with metabolites involved in fatty acid metabolism.
Fatty acid metabolism in the brain has been increasingly linked to neuropathology and cognitive integrity in LOAD; however, the overall metabolic contributions to AD progression remain unclear broadly.
That fatty acid metabolism involving both biosynthesis and oxidation may index these transitions specifically is an intriguing idea implicating well-understood genetic programs and metabolic regulatory mechanisms.
In addition to their role as biomarker candidates, these findings may consequently suggest novel therapeutic targets in DS-AD, and perhaps AD broadly, that are

DISCUSSION
This is one of the first, large-scale blood-based investigations of metabolic factors associated with aging and cognitive status in adults with DS-AD.
We used untargeted metabolomics to consider a broad scope of metabolic alterations which can be followed up in subsequent targeted metabolomic studies.
We find strong evidence of metabolic perturbations which characterize groups of people with DS who were cognitively unaffected with stable cognition, DS-MCI, and DS-AD.
In general, changes in lipid metabolism including fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation pathways characterize these phenotypic state changes, with evidence of broad, cellular energy metabolic decline present in adults with DS, from unimpaired to manifest DS-AD.
It is not clear from this study if these energy alterations begin in adulthood or are present from birth, but this is an interesting avenue for future research.
A valid concern with classification models derived from a large number of parameters and a significantly fewer number of cases (here, 8805 metabolites and 292 participants) is the risk of model overfitting and lack of generalizability from the experimental sample to the population of interest.
This remains a challenge in biomarker development across many fields.
Here, we attempted to mitigate model overfitting by using machine learning algorithms for feature selection to eliminate biases for particular metabolites or classes of metabolites.
Further, the logistic regression classification models were refined using multiple re-sampling schemes (10-fold CV and 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation) and cross-checked using a separate SVM model.
The metabolite enrichment set analysis also produced findings that are consistent with the extant literature regarding the involvement of lipid metabolism in LOAD.
4]
With respect to plaque formation, it has been observed that membrane lipid compositional changes may increase amyloidogenic processing of APP.
The mechanism for this is thought to involve increased proximity of the secretase (BACE1) enzyme and its substrate APP via lipid rafts, which overall serves to promote BACE1 activity and amyloidogenesis.
It has also been proposed that the tauopathy and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation that are hallmarks of LOAD may be subject to lipiddependent mechanisms; tau paired helical filament aggregation may initiate at the plasma membrane and lipids (ie, phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingomyelins) have been isolated from paired helical filaments derived from LOAD brain.
ere is also a growing appreciation of lipid metabolic alterations in DS.
For example, individuals with DS have peripheral lipid metabolism that differs from euploid siblings independent of body weight.
Furthermore, our group has recently reported evidence of lipid and smallmolecule metabolic alterations in the peripheral blood of adults with DS as a function of cognitive impairment.
Although it is possible that our peripheral metabolomic analyses reported here index DS-AD associated pathology directly at the cellular or subcellular level within the CNS, there is increasing reason to suspect that peripherally evident metabolic alterations (eg, of lipids, bioenergetically relevant small molecules) may co-occur with cognitive decline and reflect disease progression in a manner not entirely dependent on CNS metabolism.

Lipid metabolism in AD: shared vulnerabilities in LOAD and DS-AD?
Lipid alterations may impact plaque formation via amyloid-processing genes (presenilin 1-2; PSEN1-2) implicated in rare, heritable forms of AD (familial Alzheimer's disease [FAD]); however, there is substantial reason to think that aberrant lipid metabolism may impact sporadic LOAD directly.
Furthermore, the pattern of lipid alteration in LOAD (versus other dementias such as frontotemporal, vascular, Lewy body) may be relatively specific, suggesting a potential role of these molecules in differential diagnosis.
Importantly, the APOE 4 allele represents one of the earliest discovered and strongest common risk variants predisposing individuals to LOAD specifically,
APOE is expressed in metabolically relevant peripheral tissues such as the liver and is primarily produced in the brain by glial cells (eg, astrocytes, microglia).
thin the CNS, lipidated lipoprotein complexes (1) facilitate axonal remodeling and survival in neurons through their uptake by the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and (
The rare, recently described R47H mutation in TREM2 represents another genetic, lipid-associated risk factor impacting LOAD specifically and underscores the role of neuroinflammatory homeostasis and microglia in AD.
This relationship may instead highlight the non-metabolic (ie, bioactive signaling) roles of certain lipids (polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs]) which are produced substantially in astrocytes, but exert neuroprotective and immunomodulatory roles within neurons when taken up by these latter cells.
Although the role of glia in AD has become substantially better understood,
Although the brain represents 2% of total body mass, it contains ≈ 25% of the total unesterified cholesterol.
This may be of importance in AD given findings that individuals experiencing cognitive impairment (either due to MCI or manifest AD) demonstrate up to 30% reduction in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux into the CSF compared to cognitively intact controls.
terestingly, this parallels earlier reports suggesting that patients experiencing AD or vascular dementia demonstrate elevated levels of the plasma oxysterol 24S-hydroxycholesterol (cerebrosterol).
This may suggest that enhanced flux of this metabolite across the blood-brain barrier is associated with dementia severity.
Crucially, oxysterols of CNS origin can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the plasma, and studies in humans have confirmed that most of the oxysterol that appears in peripheral circulation comes from the brain.
Underscoring our systems-level approach to AD metabolomics, it is worth noting that oxysterols such as cerebrosterol represent a key biosynthetic intermediate bridging sterol and primary bile acid synthesis.
Bile acids may be altered in AD as a function of cognitive impairment, reflect the role of brain-gut axis dyshomeostasis in the disease, and suggest a broader association of this metabolite class with dementia-associated neuroinflammatory processes.
though peripheral dyslipidemia and poor metabolic control are associated with dementia risk, 102 there is paradoxically little correspondence between and relatively low turnover of CNS relative to peripheral cholesterol (ie, most CNS cholesterol is synthesized de novo).
Interestingly, APOE genotype is itself associated with efficiency of cholesterol efflux, with the APOE 4 AD risk allele producing the greatest reduction and promoting the formation of lipid-depleted apoE lipoprotein complexes in CSF.
though it is possible that APOE-driven LOAD risk is principally mediated through effects on amyloid processing and deposition, 104 it is also feasible that direct effects of apoE-associated lipid trafficking may impact the dementing brain.
This is perhaps particularly relevant, given that CNS tissues are metabolically heterogeneous (both macro-anatomically and with respect to cell type) and may experience suboptimal provisioning of lipids (eg, cholesterol, phospholipids) with AD progression in a cell-type or regionally dependent manner.
It is thus possible that constraints upon lipoprotein (eg, apoE, apoJ/Clusterin) mediated lipid trafficking are of substantial importance within the dementing brain, perhaps compounding other core metabolic deficits (ie, brain glucose hypometabolism) well established as features of early AD in both euploid and DS populations.

Systemic metabolic alterations in DS-AD: evidence beyond the brain
One limitation of the present study is that the untargeted metabolomic (ie, LC-MS) approaches used do not permit unambiguous chemical identification of individual dementia-associated metabolites in peripheral blood.
Nonetheless, our statistical approaches to better It is noteworthy that recent work in AD metabolomics has attempted to link disease-associated alterations within the peripheral blood metabolome to corresponding alterations in the CNS metabolome,
Due to the extensive, "connective" role of the cardiovascular system, it is, however, unclear if these blood plasma perturbations uniquely reflect brain pathology, as opposed to pathological alterations of other organ systems.
In recent years, AD has been increasingly understood as a metabolic disease,
This is certainly applicable to DS, which is marked by substantially elevated, genetically penetrant risk for both AD and type 1 diabetes.
4]
In many cases, while these molecules possess currently underappreciated roles within the CNS, their conventional roles in peripheral, metabolically active tissues remain physiologically better understood.
It will be important for future work in adults with DS-AD to better contextualize the het-erogeneity of these molecules and implicated physiological processes with respect to core AD pathophysiology.
Rather than simply reflecting an imperfect signal of brain metabolism, the peripheral plasma metabolome may instead index broader metabolic derangement associated with disease progression.

The EDTA tube was the first tube collected, followed by Sodium Heparin, Serum Separator, and PAXgene tubes.
Given the general considerations of working with people with DS, we did not attempt to standardize blood collection procedures with regard to prescribed medication administration, prandial state, or time of day.
After venipuncture, collection tubes were gently inverted 8 to 10 times, placed on wet ice, then centrifuged to separate the plasma component.
