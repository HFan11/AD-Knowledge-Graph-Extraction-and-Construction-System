Alzheimer’s Disease and Diabetes: Role of Diet, Microbiota and Inflammation in Preclinical Models
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia.
Epidemiological studies show the association between AD and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), although the mechanisms are not fully understood.
Dietary habits and lifestyle, that are risk factors in both diseases, strongly modulate gut microbiota composition.
Also, the brain-gut axis plays a relevant role in AD, diabetes and inflammation, through products of bacterial metabolism, like short-chain fatty acids.
We provide a comprehensive review of current literature on the relation between dysbiosis, altered inflammatory cytokines profile and microglia in preclinical models of AD, T2DM and models that reproduce both diseases as commonly observed in the clinic.
Increased proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNF-α, are widely detected.
Microbiome analysis shows alterations in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes phyla, among others.
Altered αand β-diversity is observed in mice depending on genotype, gender and age; therefore, alterations in bacteria taxa highly depend on the models and approaches.
We also review the use of pre-and probiotic supplements, that by favoring a healthy microbiome ameliorate AD and T2DM pathologies.
Whereas extensive studies have been carried out, further research would be necessary to fully understand the relation between diet, microbiome and inflammation in AD and T2DM.

Alzheimer's Disease
Growing life expectancy is secondarily contributing to a significant rise of pathologies associated with aging.
Among them, dementias are specially relevant due to their prevalence, economical costs and societal burden
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, which may contribute to 60-70% of total cases
AD neuropathological features include: amyloid pathology, neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic and neuronal loss
Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) can deposit as extracellular senile plaques (SP) or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) surrounding brain vessels.
On the other hand, tau dysfunction includes hyper-phosphorylation and aggregation of tau-protein in paired helical filaments, the major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles, which can cause neuron loss in AD
Neuronal loss is a later step in AD evolution and it is the pathological feature that best correlates with illness duration and severity
Whereas the vast majority of the AD cases are sporadic and the causes unknown
Apart from classical neuropathological features of AD, other alterations have been described, and the concept of neurodegeneration has expanded to accommodate early alterations that include oxidative stress or inflammation
Following this idea, neuroinflammation also plays a significant role in neurodegeneration
In this sense, AD brains suffer neuroinflammatory changes including alterations in morphology and distribution of microglia and astrocytes, or increased expression of inflammatory mediators
While microglia's response to injury is typically beneficial, it can go awry in cases of chronic injury and long-term inflammation, such as in AD.
Thereby, microglia is chronically activated in the proximity of amyloid plaques and limits amyloid plaque growth
On the other hand, growing evidence has shown that alterations in the gut microbiota composition can alter normal brain function through the so-called gut-brain axis.
Following this idea, the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract plays a key role in the pathogenesis of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and AD
Moreover, regulation of gut microbiota has been implicated in the control of neuroinflammation and AD progression
Additionally, in opposite direction, AD pathology could affect gut microbiota composition

Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Metabolic disorders include several pathologies.
Among these, diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world.
Moreover, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality and its incidence increases with age
The total number of people affected by DM is projected to rise up to 700 million in 2045 and about 90% of all the cases are of T2DM
T2DM is characterized by an initial stage of insulin resistance or prediabetes, caused by the inability of the cells to fully respond to insulin, associated with blood glucose levels above the normal range but below the diabetes diagnostic threshold
Currently, the most accepted position is that β-cell dysfunction, as impaired insulin secretion, is an independent abnormality that precedes dysglycemia, on a background of insulin resistance
Although the development of this pathology shows high hereditability, T2DM seems to be caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors
In this sense, T2DM prevalence is increasing in children and younger adults, due to rising levels of obesity, sedentary lifestyle and inappropriate diet
Systemic inflammation also plays an important role in insulin resistance and the pathogenesis of T2DM.
The disease is associated to a pro-inflammatory state with a moderate excess in the production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which hinder the interaction of insulin with its receptor and contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes
On the other hand, gut microbiota also seems to play a role in metabolic disorders including obesity, prediabetes and T2DM by influencing glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, as well as by affecting digestion of sugars and production of gut hormones that control this process
Nevertheless, the strict control of glucose levels in the gut is not only mediated by hormonal control but also by gut-brain axis control
Moreover, gut dysbiosis may affect intestinal permeability, as well as the metabolism of carbohydrates and their products
Following this idea, T2DM patients show gut microbial dysbiosis, including reduced abundance of some butyrate-producing bacteria or increased opportunistic pathogens
The decrease of short-chain fatty acids (SC-FAs) may ultimately contribute to insulin resistance
In this sense, the restoration of gut microbiota can improve metabolic alterations, which position pre-and probiotics as an interesting option to prevent and/or treat prediabetes and T2DM

AD-T2DM Relationship
Previous epidemiological studies have shown that T2DM is strongly associated with cognitive impairment and late-onset AD
Both pathologies, AD and T2DM, share several pathophysiological features
Whereas implicated mechanisms have not been fully elucidated

Inflammation
Microglia responds to pathogens and modulates the immune response in the CNS
Although brain neuroinflammation is considered a relevant player in neurodegenerative diseases and AD
The dual role of microglia in AD has been largely addressed
While brain inflammation is a hallmark associated with neurodegeneration in AD, peripheral blood inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, TNF-α or TGF-β are detected in AD patients as well
Additionally, systemic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of prediabetes and T2DM
Besides, TNF-α contributes to impair insulin signalling by increasing insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation
Altogether, it seems that T2DM, or even prediabetes, can cooperatively modulate the expression of brain pro-inflammatory cytokines in AD

Diet
Nutrition is considered a lifestyle factor that can modify the risk of dementia
Nutrients reach the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by different mechanisms, such as facilitated diffusion or active transport
Several studies have shown the role of specific nutrients, including folates and B12 vitamin, in brain volume loss in adult patients
One of the most important effects of the diet is the ability to promote or control inflammation and therefore, neuroinflammation can be modified by a dietary pattern
In this sense, Mediterranean diet (MD), considered an anti-inflammatory diet, is associated with preserved cognitive functions in elderly adults
Ketogenic diet may improve neuropathological and biochemical changes associated to AD
Likewise, studies in elderly patients have shown the neuroprotective effects of caloric restriction on memory
On the other hand, T2DM onset can be improved by modifying lifestyle, including diet intervention
Accordingly, healthy lifestyle with regular physical activity
Moreover, vegetarian diet also improves glycemic control in patients
Hence, given the close relation between AD and T2DM, diet may also be an important link factor to modulate T2DM onset and AD risk.

Gut Microbiota
Gut microbiota encodes over three million genes producing thousands of metabolites with diverse roles, including extraction, synthesis, and absorption of many nutrients and metabolites
Gut microbiota also shows an immune function against pathogenic bacteria colonization and promotes intestinal epithelium integrity
It implies a wide range of microorganisms, being the dominant phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which represents 90 percent of gut microbiota.
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, are also representative groups
The human gut microbiota suffers taxonomic and functional modifications in each part of the gastro-intestinal tract.
This leads to several variations in the same individual, due to age and environmental factors, although microbiota functions are preserved among individuals
Additionally, modifications in the diversity or structure of gut microbiota known as dysbiosis, can affect metabolic activities, resulting in metabolic disorders, like obesity and diabetes.
Consequently, dysbiosis may play a crucial role in the development of T2DM
In this sense, it has been described that type 1 diabetes and T2DM patients show microbiota dysbiosis
Additionally, dietary habits can influence gut microbiota composition.
In this sense, the Western diet (WD), a high-fat/high-sugar diet and low fiber intake, induces dysbiosis and it is associated with obesity and metabolic diseases
On the other hand, studies using the MD have shown the benefits of modifying the intestinal microbiota in obese subjects for the prevention of the development of T2DM
On the other hand, the brain-gut-microbiota axis also relates microbiota with brain pathologies like AD and Parkinson's disease
Thus, AD patients present decreased microbial diversity, including reduced Firmicutes, and increased Bacteriodetes
Furthermore, dementia patients with amyloidosis have increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in blood accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory intestinal bacteria
It should be noted that several genera of gut microbiota can produce or metabolize neurotransmitters, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
These findings position gut bacterial communities as a target for therapeutic intervention.
Moreover, given the close relation between AD and metabolic alterations, gut microbiota could provide a relevant link between both pathologies.
In this sense, undigested foods, microbes, endotoxins and immune response cause chronic inflammation that may ultimately contribute to alter the BBB integrity and trigger neuroinflammation
Interestingly, a recent study shows that obesity, highly present in T2DM patients, impairs short-term and working memory through gut microbial metabolism of aromatic amino acids

Diet, Inflammation and Gut Microbiota in AD Models
Mouse models offer a good approximation to study human gut microbiota and their implications in diseases and inflammatory processes
Despite appreciable differences between the intestinal tract of mice and humans
Interestingly, whereas there are many variations at lower taxonomic level, gut microbiota composition shows similarities at a higher taxonomic level
According to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database [100], when microbiome is analyzed dissimilarities are limited at functional level and mouse and human share 95.2% of the KEGG orthologous groups.
Nevertheless, mice and humans only share 4.0% of the genes
The mouse microbiome seems to have specifically enriched pathways involved in membrane transport, biodegradation and amino acids metabolism
Diet and housing conditions may markedly influence the composition of the gut microbiome
However, gut microbiome in mice is mainly composed by bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes, followed by phyla Firmicutes, Deferribacteres
As previously stated (Section 3.3.
Gut microbiota), AD patients
Concretely, APP/PS1 mice dysbiosis leads to alterations in metabolic and cellular pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, limonene and pinene degradation, as well as butanoate/pyruvate metabolism
Microbiome and their secretory products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are toxins that play a key role in the immune response
SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) are products of anaerobic bacteria fermentation of dietary fibers in the intestine.
SCFAs are relevant gut-microbiota mediators of inflammation and immune response
Propionate, a potent neurotoxic agent, is increased in 3xTg-AD mice by 6 months of age
On the other hand, the concentration of SCFAs, including butyric and isobutyric acids, tend to be lower in both feces and brains from 3xTg-AD mice
Likewise, gut microbiome can modulate the inflammatory response in both, the intestinal tract and the brain, through gut-brain axis
Besides, gut microbiota is critical for microglia maturation
Activated microglia cells are significantly increased in the brains from 11-month 3xTg-AD mice
Additionally, proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-1β, as well as lipocalin-2 or TNF-α expression levels are increased in the colon of APP/PS1 mice by 3 and 6 months of age
Similar results have been observed in SAMP8 mice, a spontaneous AD model, with colonic inflammation and high IL-1β levels
Moreover, IL-1β was increased, while IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-5 levels decreased in the brain from aged APP/PS1 mice
In addition, a similar cytokines profile can be observed in plasma from 14-month 3xTg-AD mice, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p40, whereas IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12 p70, IL-17, TNF-α, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL11 and GM-CSF are decreased
Gut-brain axis and gut microbiome seem to be fundamental for the load of Aβ in the brain
Previous studies have shown that germ-free APP/PS1 (amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1) mice, have lower levels of Aβ, mainly Aβ42, in brain and plasma, whereas colonization by microbiota from aged APP/PS1 mice results in increased levels of Aβ, supporting a close cross-talk between gut and brain in AD
Moreover, APP/PS1 mice on long-term antibiotics treatment (gentamicin, vancomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, ampicillin, kanamycin, colistin and cefaperazone) show lower Aβ plaque deposition and higher soluble Aβ production, favoring Aβ42 formation in the cortex and hippocampus
In addition, wildtype fecal solution administered to APP/PS1 mice, previously treated with antibiotics, also results in lower Aβ deposition and better cognitive performance
Similar outcomes have been described in ADLP APT mice after transferring fecal microbiota from wildtype mice for 4 months.
Treated ADLP APT mice show lower SP burden and lower Aβ levels
Differences in gut microbiota are observed when wildtype and AD mice are compared (Table
Previous studies have reported lower bacterial diversity and more similar bacteria composition when young AD mice are compared with wildtype counterparts
Following this idea, gut microbiota from young APP/PS1 mice [107] and 5xFAD mice
No significant differences in either αor β-diversity have been observed in 5xFAD mice at 9-10 weeks old [133], although α-diversity is lower in these mice by 6 and 12 months of age
Nevertheless, α-diversity, that conveys the diversity of species within a single sample, is significantly higher in wildtype mice compared to APP/PS1 mice by 9 months of age
It also seems that α-diversity is diminished with aging in APP/PS1 mice, as an indication of a worse health status of the host with aging
On the other hand, β-diversity shows significant differences in the microbiome composition of APP/PS1 mice by 2, 6
So, as disease progresses a marked temporal shift in the taxonomic distribution of principal phyla is detected, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio increases in APP/PS1 [107] and 5xFAD mice
An increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio is also observed when bacterial extracellular vesicles are analyzed in the serum of 8-month APP/PS1 mice
Nevertheless, the ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes is decreased in APP NL-G-F mice at this age
This increase in Firmicutes, observed in AD models, is mainly due to members of the family Erysipelotrichaceae [107] and detected dysbiosis develops an immunogenic reaction [142] that is correlated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα
By contrast, a decrease in the number of SCFAs and butyrate-producing bacteria is found in AD models.
So, families Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiaceae (class Clostridia) are significantly decreased in 8-12-month APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by altered butanoate/pyruvate metabolism
There is a positive correlation between the abundance in family Ruminococcaceae and the concentration of hypoxantine
Moreover, genus Ruminococcus (family Ruminococcaceae) is significantly lower in 8-months APP/PS1 mice, when spatial learning is aggravated in these mice
Conversely, family Ruminococcaceae is increased in 5xFAD mice by 6 and 12 months of age
In addition, 5xFAD mice have increased δ-, γ-and ε-Proteobacteria by 6 months of age, while at 12 months β-and δ-Proteobacteria are increased and ε-Proteobacteria is decreased when compared with wildtype counterparts
In line with these observations, genus Desulfovibrio is reported to be highly increased in 5 to 9 month-old APP/PS1 mice microbiome
As part of this phylum, the genus Sutterella (class β-Proteobacteria) is significantly increased in APP/PS1 mice in an age-dependent manner [107] and similar outcomes have been reported in 5xFAD mice at 12 months old
Sutterella spp.
specifically induces mild or negligible inflammatory responses and does not alter epithelial monolayer integrity
Nevertheless, their immunomodulatory role is not fully understood
Enterobacteriaceae is also increased in the microbiome of APP/PS1 mice by 6 months of age
On the other hand, phylum Verrucomicrobia, and its only known genus, mucin-degrading bacteria Akkermansia, down-regulates the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ in the colon
Akkermansia is significantly increased in APP/PS1 mice along lifespan, starting at 2 months of age
In 5xFAD mice, the presence of this phylum is limited in young mice, when compared to their wildtype counterparts
The overall dysbiosis detected in AD mice (Table
As previously stated, dietary habits strongly influence the gut microbiota composition
Therefore, new strategies try to favor a healthy microbiome through the administration of pre-and probiotics supplements as a possible treatment for AD
In line with this, 3xTg-AD mice orally fed with probiotic SLAB51 (Streptococcus, Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli) presented higher levels of Bifidobacterium spp.
and reduced levels of Campylobacterales, along with an increase of anti-inflammatory SCFAs and cytokines that down-regulate inflammatory response.
A reduction of amyloid load is also detected, accompanied by an improvement of cognitive alterations
In other study, FRAMELIM ® (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, vitamins A, D and omega 3 fatty acid) administration to APP/PS1 mice successfully reduced brain Aβ burden, despite lowering the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria
Antioxidants, such as PW5 have also provoked a shift in gut microbiota composition from APP/PS1 mice, making them more similar to wildtype counterparts, while reducing SP in the hippocampus
Although it has been described that pre-and probiotics have little effect on the microbiome of healthy population
Caloric restriction diets have also been associated with an increase of dendritic spines in the dentate gyrus and cognitive protection in mice
Intermittent fasting (IF) has also shown beneficial effects on neuropathological characteristics and cognitive deficits in AD
Interestingly, β-hydroxybutyrate protects against Aβ toxicity
Whereas previous studies have reported no significant effects of IF on neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity or cognitive function in 6-month 5xFAD mice
Cognitive impairment is also improved in APP NL-G-F mice after IF for 9 months, whereas no significant effect is observed in amyloid load
It has also been reported that IF for 3 months may increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus from 3xTg-AD mice
In line with these observations, it has been shown that ketogenic diet reduces amyloid deposition and tau pathology, improving learning and memory tasks in a 3xTg-AD mouse model

Diet, Inflammation and Gut Microbiota in T2DM Models
As previously stated, T2DM includes a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders, characterized by hyperglycemia, and influenced by both genetic and environmental factors
The most commonly used T2DM mouse models are based on leptin signaling impairment [175], including db/db and ob/ob mice.
Diet-induced models are also widely used, and different types of high-fat diet (HFD) are regularly administered to induce prediabetes, as well as to resemble the effects of WD
HFD feeding increases body weight, leptin and insulin levels as well as insulin resistance in rodents
Interestingly, the effects of HFD administration seems to be influenced by gut microbiota and the genetic background of the animals under study
Inflammatory cells including neutrophils, abnormal lymphocytes and monocytes are increased in db/db mice
In line with these observations, CD68 mRNA, as a macrophage marker, is highly expressed in white adipose tissue in these mice
In the CNS of db/db mice, microglia cells are also increased
In fact, LPS serum levels are markedly increased in db/db mice
Cytokines profile is also affected and db/db mice and previous studies have shown an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β and TNF-α in serum
CCL2, a chemokine that recruits monocytes and macrophages, is highly expressed in epididymal adipose tissue of db/db mice [186], whereas the expression of nucleotide-binding-oligomerization domain type-1 (NOD1) is suppressed
Inflammation also affects the vasculature and inflammatory markers such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, (VCAM1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) or E-selectin are increased in aortic and carotid vessels from db/db mice
Likewise, oxidative stress markers, as like 3NT-positive protein, are increased in serum
The ob/ob mouse also presents chronic inflammation of the adipose tissues which contributes to the metabolic pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance
Cytokines and chemokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCL2 are overexpressed in visceral adipose tissue
In line with these observations, elevated TNF-α levels lead to a decrease in Azgp1 mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissues of ob/ob mice
Additionally, ,  and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are increased in the adipose tissue and the spleen of ob/ob mice
IFN-γ expression decreases in ob/ob mice
Moreover, LPS levels are higher in plasma from ob/ob mice
Additionally, NF-kB levels are elevated in the brain of ob/ob mice
Other markers, such as CD11 and CD86 are increased in the brain and visceral fat tissue, whereas the expression of CD206 decreases
In line with these observations, oxidative stress is also severely affected in ob/ob animals and increased protein oxidation and lipoperoxidation are observed, accompanied by lower activity of antioxidant enzymes in kidney and heart
As previously pointed out, diet is also an experimental approach to reproduce metabolic complications and mice fed a WD show infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the liver, indicating the presence of steatohepatitis, and increased TNF-α-positive macrophages
Animals on WD overexpress pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, FOXP3, SAA1, CCL17, CCL20 and ICAM-1 in the brain
The expression of NOD-1 is suppressed in mice fed with
Following these observations, animals on HFD show an increase of crown-like structures and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, indicating adipose tissue inflammation associated with diet
Interestingly, whereas adipose tissue inflammation is observed after administration of HFD for 24 weeks, hepatic inflammation is not detected up to 40 weeks on HFD
Moreover, adipose inflammation seems to contribute to insulin resistance more severely than hepatic inflammation
In addition, He et al. found out that the phenotypic switch in adipose tissue from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory macrophages is detected after 5 weeks on HFD, while metabolic inflammation is noted after 9 weeks
An overall increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, leptin and TGFβ1 is detected in the liver of HFD-fed mice for 17 weeks [202] and up to
Moreover, other markers, such as MCP-1, PAI-1 and CCL2 are increased in adipose tissue of mice on HFD for 9 weeks [176] or up to
The gut microbiota in T2DM mice seems to be highly dependent on the genetic background and age of the animals under study
In ob/ob and db/db mice Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the dominant phyla in the gut microbiota
Other less abundant phyla found in these mice are Acidobacteria, Deferribacteres, Gemmatimonadetes,
Additionally, the ratio Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes is higher in db/db mice, than on C57Bl/6J mice
Following this idea, treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, TNFα, and IL-1β in liver and colon of T2DM mice
Prebiotic inulin modulates gut dysbiosis, increasing phylum Cyanobacteria and genus Bacteroides, that positively correlate with higher levels of IL-10 at early stages of T2DM, and negatively correlate with IL-6 and TNF-α in db/db mice
A reduction of Ruminiclostridium_6, Deferribacteres and Tenericutes is also detected in inulin-treated T2DM mice, that correlates with IL-6, TNF-α and IL-17A levels
Additionally, diet supplements such as polysaccharides from mulberry fruit
extract
Likewise, supplementation with Alpinia oxyphyla Miq.
extract increases Akkermasia spp.
while Helicobacter spp. is significantly reduced in db/db mice
This treatment modifies gut microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFAs producing bacteria and Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, while decreasing opportunistic pathogens
On the other hand, sodium-butyrate supplementation also ameliorates diabetic inflammation in db/db mice, decreasing LPS and HbA1c.
It also decreases the ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes
In mice on HFD, 15 weeks treatment with baicalin, a flavonoid used in traditional Chinese medicine, rebalances the microbiota and SCFAs-producing agents specifically, to protect the intestinal system.
Baicalin seems to regulate metabolic and immunological processes implicated in T2DM
In line with these observations, another study, using the JinQi Jiangtang (Coptis chinensis, Astragalus membranaceus and Lonicera japonica), has reported reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-6, ameliorating the inflammatory response and regulating the intestinal microbiota
Diabetic mice treated with A. membranaceus also show increased microbial diversity and enrichment of the bacterial Firmicutes spp.,
On the other hand, db/db mice on IF show a reduction of NFκB activation and decreased LPS levels, associated with a significant improvement of cognitive function, limited neuroinflammatory response, restructured gut microbiota and metabolites
Other studies in db/db mice on IF regimen for 28 days have reported a reduction of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcaceae, Arthromitus, Rummeliibacillus that cause inflammation, while increasing Lactobacillus, accompanied by the attenuation of behavioral alterations [207].

Microbiota, Inflammation and Diet in Preclinical Mixed Models in AD-T2DM
The close relation between AD and T2DM has been largely documented
While still limited, previous studies have reported the presence of AD-like pathological features related to alterations in the microbiota
Following this idea, it has been described that chronic bacterial infections are associated with amyloidosis, one of the pathological features shared by AD and T2DM
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 gene allele, the highest genetic risk factor for developing late-onset AD, is associated with increased Aβ load, neuroinflammation and alterations in brain insulin signaling
Moreover, SP deposition is higher and more compact in E4FAD mice, leading to neuroinflammation in the hippocampus
ApoE -/-mice on HFD have also shown higher APP expression
No significant differences have been observed in the expression of doublecortin or PSD95 in ApoE -/-and APOE4 mice on HFD, indicating that HFD does not affect neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity
Some studies have shown that WD administration to adult APP/PS1 mice does not result in increased SP deposition or soluble Aβ levels compared to animals on ND
Nevertheless, the vast majority of available bibliography supports the deleterious effect of HDF administration.
HFD increases hippocampal Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice with no significant effect on memory
APP/PS1 mice on HFD present a lower percentage of spines and deterioration of newborn neurons when compared with wildtype mice on normal diet (ND)
Similarly, an exacerbation of synaptic loss has been detected in APP/PS1xdb/db mice
Other studies have reported increased amyloid and tau pathologies, vascular damage and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice on HFD
Even short-term HFD [242] increases tau phosphorylation
Cognitive deficits might be due to loss of synaptic plasticity, since a reduction of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 activity accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the BDNF gene have been reported
An overlap in the inflammatory mechanisms has also been described in AD and T2DM
Previous findings confirmed that the microglial receptor for advanced glycation end products in T2DM may mediate microglial activation and neuroinflammation AD brains
Increased neuroinflammation might not be exclusively related to HFD, since wildtype mice on HFD do not show a significant increase in the number of activated glial cells in the hippocampus, supporting a synergistic contribution when AD and metabolic disease are set together [240], as regularly observed in the clinic.
MIP-1α, IL-1β, and IL-17 are altered in the cortex from APP/PS1 mice on HFD that also show increased IL-1β and TNF-α, accompanied by gliosis and disrupted neurogenesis in the hippocampus
Higher levels of circulating blood monocytes, MCP-1, and ox-LDL are also observed in plasma from these mice, indicating severe systemic inflammation in these animals
Interestingly, IL1-β, IL-12p70 and IL-13 correlate with insulin levels in APP/PS1xdb/db mice and IL
In line with these observations, microglial activation is also increased 3xTg-AD on HFD
An exacerbated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 or TNF-α is observed in APOE4 mice
Moreover, FAD mutations induce neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of APOE4 mice, by inducing the expression of genes for chemokine ligand 4, low-affinity Fc IgG receptor 4, chemokine 10 of the CXC motif, and α-integrin increased
On the other hand, ApoE -/-and APOE4 mice show significantly more inflammation in CA1 when fed with ND than wildtype mice, but these mice treated with HFD show decreased CD68 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus
Furthermore, microbiome related inflammation may play a role at this level [249-251] since wildtype and ApoE -/-mice on HFD present higher LPS plasma levels and a higher expression of cytokines in the colon and hippocampus
LPS induced endotoxemia in APOE4 mice results in an increase of plasma TNFα and G-CSF when compared with APOE3 mice.
Besides, CD8 + T cell apoptosis is observed in APOE4 mice after LPS injection
Diet-induced intestinal dysbiosis produces an imbalance in the microbiota that can have inflammatory consequences in the AD brain
Interestingly, alteration of brain function and gut microbiota have been related to HFD administration during gestation
Therefore, the disbalance in the composition of the gut microbiota could explain the altered eating behavior, memory impairment and abnormal exploratory performance of the offspring from mothers on HFD.
Moreover, these studies may support the implications of early-life alterations in later development of neurodegenerative complications
Specific assessment of 3xTg-AD mice on HFD showed a severe lack of the families Muribaculaceae, Peptococcaceae (genus rc4.4),
Dehalobacteriaceae, accompanied by an excess of genus Clostridium (Table
This study confirms that HFD and genetic predisposition to neurodegenerative diseases share abnormalities in the microbiome and metabolome that are unfavorable for brain health.
On the other hand, microbiota alterations associated with APOE have been found at 4 and 6-months of age, including changes in Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Gastranaerophilales, Lactobacillaceae, Peptococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae (genus Turicibacter), Desulfovibrionaceae and Mycoplasmataceae (genus Mollicutes)
Moreover, E4FAD mice had a greater α-diversity but reduced relative abundance of beneficial gut microbiota (Prevotella and Lactobacillus), accompanied by an increase of pro-inflammatory microbiota (Escherichia, Turicibacter and Akkermansia) (Table
However, Lactococcus, that has been implicated in a better performance in behavioral tests, is not present in ApoE -/-animals [235].
Caloric restriction has been considered an experimental diet that can lengthen the lifespan in various animal models
Other diet strategies to ameliorate AD symptoms are based in prebiotics such as inulin that stimulates the growth and activity of SCFAs-producing bacteria.
Inulin administration also reduces proinflammatory gene expression in the hippocampus and Aβ deposits in E4FAD mice
It also contributed to a larger size of the caecum, improving the microbial content, even before the development of the Aβ pathology in E4FAD mice.
An improvement in systemic metabolism associated to the modulation of the intestinal microbiome has also observed in this model
Although further studies would be necessary to understand the functional and morphological characteristics mediated by inflammation, microbiota, and diet in mixed preclinical models of AD-T2DM, observations based on experimental animal models may contribute to the development of optimal techniques and therapies to reverse the complications associated with AD and metabolic alterations.

Common Microbiota Alterations in AD, T2DM and Mixed Preclinical Models
AD and T2DM share common pathological features that include impairment in insulin signaling, alteration of amyloid and tau pathologies or vascular damage that have been largely revised before
At inflammatory level, as stated in this review and in previous studies, proinflammatory cytokines are favored in AD, T2DM and mixed preclinical models.
Among others, it has been shown that IL-1β is increased in the brain from aged APP/PS1 [124] as well as in APP/PS1xdb/db mice
IL-1β and TNF-α are also increased in the brain from db/db mice [187] as well as in APP/PS1 mice on HFD
Whereas the role of the gut microbiota as a feasible connection between both diseases remain largely unexplored, some common links have been reported (Graphic Abstract).
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the dominant phyla in AD, T2DM and mixed models
Bacteroidetes (family Muribaculaceae) is reduced in db/db mice at 8 months of age [209] and 3xTg-AD mice on HFD also show a severe lack of
This phylum (family Prevotellaceae) is also decreased in E4FAD and db/db mice at 8 months of age
Actinobacteria (family Coriobacteriaceae) has been reported to be increased both in APP/PS1
Nevertheless, other studies have reported increases in the Bacteroidaceae family, both in AD
The Clostridiaceae family is transiently increased in the feces of 5xFAD mice at 9 weeks
Similarly, it is increased in ob/ob mice at 8 weeks of age
Other studies have reported that the Lachnospiraceae family is more abundant in AD preclinical models (3 month-old APP/ PS1 mice and 5xFAD mice at 6 months of age)
Likewise, the family Lactobacillaceae has been shown to be increased in AD mice
Other alterations include increases of the Enterobacteriaceae family in db/db and AD mice, including 6 month-old APP/PS1
The Desulfovibrionaceae family (Genus Desulfovibrio) is also increased in 5-9 month-old APP/PS1
Similar outcomes have been reported in 12-week-old db/db mice
It has also been shown that family Helicobacteraceae is increased in 3-8 month-old APP/PS1 mice, 6 month-old 5xFAD mice and after HFD administration
Interestingly, previous studies suggest that AD and T2DM pathologies can improve through the treatment of pre-and probiotics

Conclusions
The extensive review of available bibliography shows that gut microbiota composition, and the brain-gut axis are affected in AD, T2DM and mixed models of AD and metabolic disorders, affecting inflammation through products of bacterial metabolism, like SCAFs.
Proinflammatory cytokines are widely altered in mouse models of both diseases.
Microbiota is highly affected as diseases progress, and alterations in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes phyla, among others, are commonly observed in animal models harboring AD, T2DM or AD and metabolic disease.
All these observations based on preclinical models have contributed to further understand the key role of the gut-brain axis in both pathologies.
Nevertheless, conflicting results have also been reported and therefore further studies would be necessary to fully understand the relation between diet, microbiota and inflammation in AD and T2DM.

.D.: not detected; =: no differences; ↓: decrease; ↑: increase; ↑↑: strong increase.Gram-negative phylum Bacteroidetes, that are the main producers of acetate and propionate[141], seem to steadily increase with aging in both APP/PS1 and wildtype animals, but they are less abundant in APP/PS1 mice, being families Rikenellaceae[90,107]and Bacteroidaceae (genus Prevotella) [132] significantly lower in APP/PS1 mice [90].
A similar pattern is observed in 5xFAD mice at 6 and 12 months of age [134].
Oppositely, genus Prevotella seems to be increased in 3xTg-AD mice by 11 months of age [119].
On the other hand, gram-positive phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate producingbacteria [141], increases with age and has higher presence in APP/PS1 animals than in wildtype mice by 24 months of age [107].
Similar outcomes have been reported in 5xFAD mice by 9 weeks of age [139] and in


. On the other hand, family Muribaculaceae is reduced in db/db mice by 8 months of age [209], while other studies have reported that genus Rikenella (family Rikenellaceae) is increased in db/db mice by 6 months of age [210].
It also seems that genera Paraprevotella and Alloprevotella, (family Prevotellaceae) are increased in db/db mice by 6 months of age, while the genus Alloprevotella decreases by 8 months of age [209,211].
Families Enterococcaceae and Planococcaceae (class Bacilli) [211], as well as genus Klebsiella (Enterobacteriaceae) are also increased in db/db mice by 6 months of age [211].
