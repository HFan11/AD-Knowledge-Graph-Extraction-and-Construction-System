Antipsychotics for agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia

Background
Typical and atypical antipsychotics are widely used to treat agitation and psychosis in dementia.
However, whether or not they are beneficial is uncertain.
Some trials have yielded negative results and e ectiveness may be outweighed by harms.

Objectives
To assess the e icacy and safety of antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE (Ovid Sp), Embase (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov
and the World Health Organization's meta-register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal on 7 January 2021.
Two review authors independently screened the title and abstract of the hits, and two review authors assessed the full text of studies that got through this screening.

Selection criteria
We included randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trials comparing the e ects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting.
(The majority of) participants had to have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline.
We excluded studies about antipsychotics that are no longer available in the USA or EU, or that are used for emergency short-term sedation.
We also excluded head-to-head trials and antipsychotic withdrawal trials.

Data collection and analysis
The primary outcomes were (1) reduction in agitation or psychosis in participants with agitation or psychosis, respectively at baseline, and (2) the number of participants with adverse events: somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms, any adverse event, any serious adverse event (SAE), and death.

Main results
The search yielded 8233 separate hits.
A er assessing the full-text of 35 studies, we included 24 trials that met the eligibility criteria.
Six trials tested a typical antipsychotic, four for agitation and two for psychosis.
Twenty trials tested an atypical antipsychotic, eight for agitation and 12 for psychosis.
Two trials tested both drug types.
Seventeen of 26 comparisons were performed in patients with Alzheimer's disease specifically.
The other nine comparisons also included patients with vascular dementia or mixed dementia.
Together, the studies included 6090 participants (12 to 652 per study).
The trials were performed in institutionalised, hospitalised and community-dwelling patients, or a combination of those.
For typical antipsychotics (e.g.
haloperidol, thiothixene), we are uncertain whether these drugs improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean di erence (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.57 to -0.15, 4 studies, n = 361); very low-certainty evidence, but typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.03, 2studies, n= 240; low-certainty evidence) compared with placebo.
These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence (risk ratio (RR) 2.62, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.56, 3 studies, n = 466; moderatecertainty evidence) and increase extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.23, 3 studies, n = 467; high-certainty) evidence.
There was no evidence regarding the risk of any adverse event.
The risks of SAEs (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.66, 1 study, n = 193) and death (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00, 6 studies, n = 578) may be increased slightly, but these estimates were very imprecise, and the certainty was low.
The e ect estimates for haloperidol from five trials were in line with those of the drug class.
Atypical antipsychotics (e.g.
risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) probably reduce agitation slightly (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.12, 7 studies, n = 1971; moderate-certainty evidence), but probably have a negligible e ect on psychosis (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.03, 12 studies, n = 3364; moderate-certainty evidence).
These drugs increase the risk of somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.39, 13 studies, n -3878; high-certainty evidence) and are probably also associated with slightly increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.68, 15 studies, n = 4180; moderate-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.61, 15 studies, n= 4316; moderate-certainty evidence) and death (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.05, 17 studies, n= 5032; moderate-certainty evidence), although the latter estimate was imprecise.
The drugs probably have a negligible e ect on the risk of any adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, 11 studies, n = 2785; moderate-certainty evidence).
The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class.

Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics might decrease agitation and psychosis slightly in patients with dementia.
Atypical antipsychotics reduce agitation in dementia slightly, but their e ect on psychosis in dementia is negligible.
The apparent e ectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice may be explained by a favourable natural course of the symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups.
Both drug classes increase the risk of somnolence and other adverse events.
If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative.

P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y
Do antipsychotic medicines reduce agitated behaviour and psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia?

Key messages
It is uncertain whether older, first-generation or 'typical' antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol have an e ect on agitated behaviour (for example, restlessness and aggression); the e ect is moderate at best.
Typical antipsychotic medicines may decrease delusions and hallucinations slightly in people with dementia.
Newer, second-generation 'atypical' antipsychotic medicines, such as risperidone, probably reduce agitated behaviour slightly.
Atypical antipsychotic medicines probably have no e ect on psychotic symptoms.
Both first-and second-generation antipsychotic medicines increase the risk of drowsiness and other unwanted events.
When patients' symptoms improve a er antipsychotics have been prescribed, this is probably largely due to natural improvement in symptoms over time.

What are antipsychotic medicines?
Antipsychotics are medicines prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms and severely disturbed behaviour in some mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression.
Psychotic symptoms are delusions (very strongly held beliefs in something which is not true) and hallucinations (sensing -usually seeing or hearing -things which are not really there).
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 1. first-generation (older) or 'typical' antipsychotics, for example haloperidol; 2. second-generation (newer) or 'atypical' antipsychotics, for example risperidone.
Both types can cause unwanted e ects, such as drowsiness, movement disorders (for example, involuntary or uncontrollable movements, tremors, muscle contractions) and weight gain.

Why do people with dementia need antipsychotics?
People with dementia quite o en experience hallucinations and delusions during their illness for some time.
Particularly in the later stages of the illness, they may also show agitated behaviours such as restlessness, shouting out or aggression towards others.
It is important to try to understand what is driving these behaviours and there are many ways to manage them which do not involve drugs.
However, antipsychotic medicines have o en been prescribed to people with dementia for these problems.
In many countries, they are prescribed less o en than in the past but are still used when the symptoms are severe.

What did we want to find out?
We wanted to know how well antipsychotic medicines reduce the severity of agitation and psychotic symptoms in people with the two commonest types of dementia, namely dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
We also wanted to know how many people experienced unwanted e ects.

What did we do?
We searched for studies that investigated antipsychotic medicines currently available in the USA or European Union by comparing them with placebo (a 'dummy' pill), for treatment of persistent agitation or psychotic symptoms.
People in the studies had to have Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.
They could be any age and reside in a care home, a hospital, or the community.
Most of the people in the studies had to be experiencing agitation (including aggression) or psychotic symptoms, or both, at the start of the study.
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.

What did we find?
We found 24 studies with a total of 6090 people:
-six studies tested typical antipsychotics, mostly haloperidol; -20 studies tested atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole; and -two studies tested both typical and atypical antipsychotics.
All the studies compared antipsychotics with placebo.
The people were living in institutions, hospitals, the community, or a combination of these settings.

Main results
Typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, thiothixene) compared with placebo:
-may improve symptoms of psychosis slightly (2 studies, 240 people), but we are uncertain about their e ect on agitation (4 studies, 361 people); -probably increase the risk of drowsiness (3 studies, 466 people), and movement disorders (3 studies, 467 people); -may slightly increase the risk of serious unwanted e ects (1 study, 193 people) and of death (6 studies, 578 people).
There was no evidence about the risk of non-serious and serious unwanted e ects combined.
Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine) compared with placebo:
-probably slightly reduce agitation (7 studies, 1971 people) and may slightly reduce aggression (1 study, 301 people), but probably make no important di erence to symptoms of psychosis (12 studies, 3364 people); -increase the risk of drowsiness (13 studies, 2878 people) and probably slightly increase movement disorders (15 studies, 4180 people); -probably slightly increase the risk of experiencing any non-serious or serious unwanted e ect combined, the risk of serious unwanted e ects, and the risk of death (17 studies, 5032 people).

B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition
Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterised by cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional symptoms.
It involves cognitive deterioration, disturbances in language, psychological and psychiatric changes, and impairments in activities of daily living (ADL).
Five per cent of people aged over 60 years (Prince 2015), and in 2015, an estimated 47 million people were living with dementia worldwide.
The total number of people with dementia will most likely continue to rise as the age of the population increases.
Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia
Neuropsychiatric symptoms, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia Agitation and psychosis can occur as a result of other causes (superimposed on dementia).
Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of possible precipitating somatic, psychosocial and environmental factors such as pain, delirium, unmet needs, and annoying sounds should be performed to rule out other treatable causes, before hypothesising that agitation and psychosis are due to the dementia syndrome and considering the use of antipsychotics.
Despite the wide use of antipsychotics for agitation and psychosis in dementia, their benefit is uncertain because some trials have yielded negative results and e ectiveness may be outweighed by harms
Antipsychotics have various severe adverse e ects such extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), somnolence, and (further) cognitive decline

Description of the intervention
Less frequent but serious adverse events (SAEs) are malignant neuroleptic syndrome, strokes, falls, and pneumonia (Banerjee 2010;
Regulatory agencies issued a warning about the use of atypical antipsychotics in people with dementia in the mid-2000s due to an increased risk of death and stoke in this population
Cohort studies have also shown an association between use of typical antipsychotics and an increased risk of mortality in older people
However, it has also been postulated that this the cooccurrence of the use of typical antipsychotics and deaths might result from "confounding by indication" because many cohort studies included people with terminal illness and delirium, but did not adjust for severity of disease
This could also explain why mortality is highest during the first month of use (Luijendijk 2016).
Overprescribing of antipsychotics in people with dementia has become a major problem.
Antipsychotic drugs are o en prescribed inappropriately (unclear indication, presence of contraindications, or chronic use longer than necessary or advocated) and with little monitoring
The use of antipsychotics in people with dementia has also provoked much debate due to the potential for SAEs.
In addition, some consider the use of antipsychotics to be simply a chemical restraint, suggesting that antipsychotics are used to calm people down with the sedative e ects rather than to treat agitation and psychosis specifically or searching for and remedying the triggers for these behaviours (Hughes 2008).
Furthermore, it has been shown that long-term use of antipsychotics could be successfully discontinued in people with dementia (Van Leeuwen 2018).

How the intervention might work
Almost all typical antipsychotics are antagonists at the dopamine receptor.
This e ect is considered to reduce agitation and psychosis, but also cause adverse drug reactions, including motor EPS, sedation, and endocrine changes.
Atypical antipsychotics also act on serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic and muscarinic receptors

Why it is important to do this review
In the current review, we have updated and combined two previous Cochrane Reviews.
Both were published when concern about the use of antipsychotics began to emerge.
The first concerned haloperidol for agitation in dementia
This review did not cover psychosis in dementia.
The second concerned atypical antipsychotics for neuropsychiatric symptoms
The present review will focus on agitation (with or without aggression) and psychosis.
In addition, we wish to present the evidence for atypical and typical antipsychotics in one review so that the reader can make an informed choice between the two types of drugs.
This review will support decision-making for clinicians, carers, and patients.
Finally, the widespread use of antipsychotics as well as the potentially unfavourable balance between benefits and harms call for an up-to-date review.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies
We included randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing the e ects of antipsychotics and placebo for the treatment of agitation or psychosis in people with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.
We included full journal publications, online clinical trial results, summaries of otherwise unpublished clinical trials, and abstracts.
We also included studies which report insu icient data for analysis and described the results narratively.
We excluded studies that were non-randomised, case reports, and clinical observations.
We also excluded studies using antipsychotics that are no longer available on the US or EU market, studies of antipsychotics that are used for acute shortterm sedation in emergency situations, studies comparing di erent antipsychotics head to head, and antipsychotic withdrawal trials.
There were no language restrictions.

Types of participants
We included trials in people with a diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or both, irrespective of age, severity of cognitive impairment, and setting.
Diagnoses of dementia must have been made with established diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's or vascular dementia.
We also included studies with mixed dementia populations if at least 80% of the participants had Alzheimer's or vascular dementia.
We excluded trials in people with other types of dementia, or delirium.

Types of interventions
We included all studies using typical and atypical antipsychotics that are presently available for use on the US or EU market.
As typical antipsychotics, we considered substances coded in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) as N05AA, N05AB, N05AD, N05AF, and N05AG (e.g.
chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, flupentixol, fluphenazine, haloperidol, levomepromazine, perphenazine, pimozide, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, zuclopenthixol).
Atypical antipsychotics are ATC coded as N05AE, N05AH, N05AL, and N05AX (e.g.
amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, sulpiride, zotepine, ziprasidone) (WHO 2017).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes
• E icacy:
• severity of agitation in participants with agitation, or severity of psychosis in participants with psychosis.
• Adverse e ects:
• somnolence;
• EPS; • any adverse event;
• any SAE, which is defined by the FDA and EMA as resulting in death, being life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation, or causing prolongation of existing hospitalisation, resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or requiring interventions to prevent permanent impairment or damage.
This includes stroke, thromboembolism, and pneumonia; • death.

Secondary outcomes
• Responders for agitation or psychosis in trials that included participants with agitation or psychosis respectively at baseline (response according to definition of primary study authors, or improvement on Clinical Global Impression scale).

• Discontinuation (any reason).
• Discontinuation due to adverse events.
• Health-related quality of life.
• Functioning in activities of daily living (ADL).
• Cognitive functioning;.
• Carer burden or carer quality of life.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches
We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), which is the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's (CDCIG) specialised register on 7 January 2021.
ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists for the CDCIG, and contains studies that fall within the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and management, and cognitive enhancement in healthy elderly populations.
The studies are identified through searching: To view a list of all sources searched, see the ALOIS website (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois).
Details of the search strategies run in healthcare bibliographic databases, used for the retrieval of reports of dementia, cognitive improvement, and cognitive enhancement trials, can be viewed on the CDCIG's website (dementia.cochrane.org/searches).
We ran additional searches in MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACs (Bireme), ClinicalTrials.gov,
and the WHO Portal/ICTRP to ensure that the searches for this review are as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible.
The search strategies used for the retrieval of reports of trials can be seen in Appendix 1.

Searching other resources
We searched relevant trial registers of pharmaceutical companies such as those listed in Section 6.2.3.3 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).
In addition, we searched regulatory agency sources European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relevant clinical study reports

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies
A er removing duplicates, two review authors independently assessed eligibility of studies identified by the search with the defined inclusion criteria.
Both review authors independently reviewed full texts of each study deemed possibly relevant.
We used Covidence to facilitate the process.
We resolved disagreements in consensus discussions or consultation of a third review author.
We reported details of included studies in the Characteristics of included studies table and reasons for exclusion in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
We collated multiple reports of the same study including retraction statements and errata, and other unpublished key information.
We included a PRISMA flow chart in the full review showing the status of identified studies (Moher 2009), as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).
We included studies irrespective of whether measured outcome data are reported in a 'usable' way.

Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted data using Covidence.
We collected the following data from the main article and other data sources.
Clinical response was treated as a binary variable (present or not) and we used the definition of the study authors.
If a response was not defined but measured with the Clinical Global Impression scale or a comparable instrument, we used the categories 'very much improved', 'much improved' and 'minimally improved'.
Patients with missing data were regarded as not having a favourable response.
We resolved any disagreements by discussion and consensus using Covidence.
A er reaching consensus, we transferred data into RevMan Web (Review Manager 2019).

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019).
Two review authors independently assessed and rated the methodological quality of the studies to identify any potential source of bias.
We assessed the following aspects of trial design: selection bias (random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, comparability of groups at baseline); performance bias (blinding of personnel and participants); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete reporting of outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting) and other bias (run-in period).
We found very few protocols of studies that were published, and only assessed protocol deviations in terms of selective reporting.
Commercial funding was one of the extracted general study

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews characteristics.
We categorised studies as having low, high, or unclear risk of bias.
The judgements were compared automatically so that discrepancies could be discussed and resolved.

Measures of treatment e ect
Where possible, we expressed the treatment e ect on a continuous outcome (change from baseline in psychosis or agitation) as pooled standardised mean di erence (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CIs).
We included all reported measurement instruments for agitation and psychosis in these analyses, and ensured that higher scores have the same meaning across instruments.
We expressed the treatment e ect on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs.
Where informative, we performed meta-analyses to calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or the number needed to harm for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) based on pooled risk di erences (RDs).
We performed the statistical analyses using RevMan Web (Review Manager 2019).

Unit of analysis issues
We combined data from multiple active drug groups within a trial if they tested the same drug (multiple dosages).
We included cross-over studies using first-phase data only to avoid carry-over e ects.
We excluded groups treated with more than one drug in the same group or groups treated with other psychotropic drugs.
If we included more than one study arm per study in the same analysis, we split the control group following the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to avoid that it counted multiple times (Higgins 2019).
We included studies that had a run-in period before randomisation, even though some eligible participants who met inclusion criteria for the study at the start of the run-in period, might have been excluded from participation at the end of the run-in period (Hulshof 2020).

Dealing with missing data
Where possible, we contacted authors of the included studies to obtain missing data.
We used data from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses if available.
Otherwise, we planned to also included data from per-protocol analyses but perform sensitivity analyses to assess for their e ect, but this was not the case in any of the included studies.

Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed heterogeneity of the treatment e ect between the trials with the Chi statistic.
We used a fixed-e ect model, unless the I statistic was greater than 40%, in which case we used a randome ects model.

Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed reporting bias with a funnel plot if at least 10 studies were available for meta-analysis.

Data synthesis
We used RevMan Web (Review Manager 2019) to analyse the data.
We calculated the pooled e ects of typical and atypical antipsychotics on agitation and psychosis separately.
When investigating adverse e ects, we pooled data from studies independent of the indication investigated (agitation or psychosis).
If meta-analysis was not suitable because of heterogeneity or insu icient data, we presented a narrative synthesis.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We reran all analyses including only haloperidol and risperidone studies, as these are the antipsychotics of first choice in many countries in 2019.
We did not perform subgroup analyses related to participant characteristics.
We also conducted a post-hoc subgroup analysis among studies including patients with (any type of) agitation versus one trial that included only patients with physical aggression.
In addition, in response to a reviewer's comment, we performed post-hoc analyses for quetiapine only.

Sensitivity analysis
We did not perform a pre-planned sensitivity analysis excluding trials with at least one rating of high risk of bias because all studies had a high risk of bias rating in at least one domain.
We also did not perform the pre-planned sensitivity analysis excluding trials that only reported per-protocol analysis due to the lack of such studies.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence
We assessed the overall quality of the body of evidence for the most important outcomes using the GRADE approach (Guyatt 2013a; Guyatt 2013b).
This includes taking into account: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias.
For e icacy, bias away from the null was considered a threat to validity, and bias to the null for adverse e ects.
If a 95% confidence interval was so wide that it included no e ect or a clinically negligible e ect, the evidence would be downgraded one level for imprecision.
We described the results using a standardised wording that incorporates the certainty of evidence and the importance of benefits or harms as described in Chapter 15 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2020).
High-certainty evidence is described as 'improves/reduces' the outcome (for important benefits or harm), 'improves/reduces slightly' (less important benefits or harm), and 'have little or no e ect' (for no or negligible benefits or harm).
Moderate-certainty evidence is described as 'probably improves/ reduces' the outcome (for important benefits or harm), 'probably improves/reduces slightly' (less important benefits or harm), and 'probably have little or no e ect' (for no or negligible benefits or harm).
Low-certainty evidence is described as 'may improve/ reduce' the outcome (for important benefits or harm), 'may improve/reduce slightly' (less important benefits or harm), or 'may have little or no e ect' (for no or negligible benefits or harm).
Very-low certainty evidence is described as 'we are uncertain whether...improves/reduces' the outcome.
Based on the available data, we presented the results of the following outcomes in the summary of findings tables for typical and atypical antipsychotics:
• agitation in trials that included patients with agitation; To present the e ects of the drug classes on the continuous outcomes agitation and psychosis in the summary of findings tables, we converted the SMDs to absolute changes from baseline in units of a representative measurement instrument for the placebo and antipsychotics groups (CMAI for agitation and NPI-NH psychosis subscale for psychosis).
We calculated the average absolute change of the placebo groups in studies that used this instrument.
We calculated the average absolute change of the antipsychotics group by multiplying the SMD with the weighted average SD of change in the antipsychotics groups of the studies that used this instrument, and adding this figure to the average absolute change of the placebo group.
For the dichotomous outcomes response, EPS, somnolence, and death, we present the number of participants with the outcome per 100 patients.
Absolute and relative e ects of treatment that derive from the di erences between the groups, expressed in changes or risks, are also shown in the summary of findings tables.

Typical antipsychotics versus placebo

E icacy
Five studies investigated the e ect of typical antipsychotics on agitation and four could be pooled.
Given the very low-certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether typical antipsychotics improve agitation compared with placebo (standardised mean di erence (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI ) -0.57 to -0.15;
I 2 = 58%, n = 361; Analysis 1.1; Figure
The study that was not included in the meta-analysis reported no clinically meaningful di erence between the antipsychotic and placebo group at the end of the study (the mean di erence in decrease on the CMAI between the groups was -1.0, with a mean at baseline of 35.2 (range 25 to 44); Auchus 1997).
Two studies evaluated the e ect of typical antipsychotics on psychosis.
Low-certainty evidence showed that typical antipsychotics may improve psychosis slightly compared with placebo (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.03, n = 240; Analysis 1.2; Figure

[Not identical] Mean

D I S C U S S I O N
In this systematic review, we included 24 randomised trials that tested the e ect of one or more antipsychotics on agitation or psychosis in persons with dementia.

Summary of main results
We identified five trials that tested haloperidol and one that tested thiothixene.
The pooled results indicate that typical antipsychotics might improve psychosis slightly compared with placebo, while the e ect on agitation is uncertain.
These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence and extrapyramidal symptoms.
There was no evidence regarding the risk of at least one adverse event, and a slight increase in the risk of a serious adverse event (SAE) or death.
The e ect estimates for haloperidol were in line with those of the drug class, although haloperidol may have a small e ect on agitation.
In addition, we identified 20 trials that tested one of following atypical antipsychotics: aripiprazole, brexpiprazol, olanzapine, pimavanserin, quetiapine, risperidone, and tiapride.
Atypical antipsychotics had a negligible e ect on psychosis and a slight e ect on agitation.
These drugs probably increase the risk of somnolence and extrapyramidal symptoms.
They probably increase the risk of any adverse event.
The risk of a serious adverse event and the risk of death are slightly increased.
The findings from seven trials for risperidone were in line with those for the drug class.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
There is low certainty about the e ect of typical antipsychotics on psychosis in dementia, due to a small number of studies (only two studies).
The number of studies and the number of participants included in the studies about the e ect of typical antipsychotics on agitation were too small to provide a precise estimate (four studies).
These drugs were developed when trials were not performed and published as o en as nowadays.
It is unlikely that new trials with haloperidol will be performed soon.
The lack of evidence is unfortunate because the current estimates with high upper limit of the confidence intervals does not preclude the possibility that typical antipsychotics have a larger/more substantial e ect on psychosis and moderate e ect on agitation.
Moreover, old studies used high doses of haloperidol that may have negatively a ected the balance between beneficial and harmful e ects.
Compared to studies on atypical antipsychotics, studies on typical antipsychotics o en lack elaborate documentation of adverse events.
This is most probably due to the fact that most studies are fairly old and were conducted when reporting of adverse events was less regulated by marketing authorities.
In contrast, there was a large number of studies that tested the e ect of atypical antipsychotics on psychosis and agitation in dementia (12 and eight studies, respectively), and most studies were relatively large.
As a result, the e ect estimates are very precise and give certainty that these drugs only have a small e ect on agitation and little or no e ect on psychosis.
With mean SMDs of -0.21 and -0.11 for agitation and psychosis, respectively, one could seriously question the clinical relevance, as SMDs of 0.20 are defined by
The negative results of this review for antipsychotics in general and more specific for haloperidol, risperidon, and quetiapine seem to contradict the widespread use of antipsychotics.
There may be a number of explanations.
First, patients treated with antipsychotics in daily practice may have more severe symptoms than patients enrolled in the trials in this review.
In one trial among patients with aggression, i.e. severe agitation, the e ect of risperidone was somewhat greater (SMD -0.38: -0.61 to -0.15) (Brodaty 2003 RIS-AUS-05) than that on agitation in the other six trials (SMD -0.18; -0.28 to -0.08).
In these six trials, the severity of agitation at baseline varied.
In the two trials among populations with the highest baseline agitation (given the range of the scale used), tiapride showed a somewhat greater e ect as well (SMD -0.39: -0.66 to -0.11), but quetiapine did not (SMD -0.15; -0.40 to 0.09)
Secondly, hospitalised and institutionalised patients with severe and dangerous symptoms may have delirium, whether or not superimposed on dementia.
Delirium is o en missed (Wahid 2004), and most of the trials in our review did not exclude patients with delirium explicitly.
As e icacy of antipsychotics is very low in delirium (Neufeld 2019), missed deliriums may explain a part of the negative results.

Thirdly, the relationship of dosage with e icacy and AEs is also relevant.
Studies of typical antipsychotics allowed doctors to prescribe relatively high doses if deemed necessary.
Hence, the doses cannot explain that our review found only a slight e ect on agitation and psychosis.
On the other hand, studies about atypical antipsychotics sometimes used relatively low maximum (fixed or flexible) doses.
This might explain the lack of e icacy, although a previous review did not show dose-response e ects
The di erences in dosing between the drug classes may explain the apparent di erence in risk of AEs between them.

Quality of the evidence
A limitation of the evidence is the patients enrolled in the identified trials were not representative of all patients for which antipsychotics are considered.
First, the studies did not include many patients with vascular dementia.
In addition, it is unclear whether the studies recruited patients who had not responded to non-pharmacological measures.
Such measures are recommended by many guidelines as the treatment of first choice.
Finally, the use of strict exclusion criteria in most trials may have decreased the representativeness of the study populations.
For instance, some studies excluded patients with terminal disease.
Another limitation is that none of the included studies scored low risk of bias on all items.
Randomisation procedures were frequently described poorly with just five studies reporting the method of sequence generation and three studies the method of concealment allocation.
Despite randomisation, five studies showed clinically relevant baseline di erences between groups that might have biased the results of the studies.
Blinding procedures were not described well either.
Just seven studies reported the explicit blinding of patients and personnel and/or outcome assessors.
In the other studies, this was implied by the use of placebo.
At least half of the studies showed a high risk of bias due to incomplete data, selective reporting, and commercial funding.
Given the o en unclear or high risk of bias, it cannot be ruled out that the reported e ects of the drugs on agitation and psychosis were overestimated, and the risks of adverse events underestimated, and so were the pooled estimates that we present.
Although uncommon in Cochrane Reviews, we assessed the use of a run-in period, because it can a ect the validity of the study results for the population of interest (as defined in the PICO).
A run-in period takes place between screening and randomisation.
Prohibited drugs or investigated drugs already in use can be washed out, a placebo can be given to identify placebo-responders, and sometimes the investigated drug is given.
Participants are sometimes blinded, but clinical assessors and investigators are usually not blinded.
Hence, participants that respond favourably to wash-out or placebo or unfavourably to introduction of an active drug can be deselected at the end of a run-in period.
Use of a run-in period in trials about antipsychotics and antidepressants has been associated with overestimated treatment e ects, and especially underestimated risks of adverse events (Bridge 2007; Hulshof 2020;
Most of the studies included in our review used a runin period, and so bias may have been introduced.

Potential biases in the review process
We found three studies that have not been published in a journal.
Therefore, these studies lacked external peer review as a quality criterion.
Although we included many outcomes and did not correct for multiple testing, we do not think that this introduced bias because the conclusions of our review are mostly negative for beneficial e ects, and positive for harmful e ects.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews
One prior review assessed the e ect of haloperidol on agitation in dementia (Lonergan 2002).
The search was updated in 2010 and yielded no new evidence.
It reported a negligible e ect on agitation (SMD -0.12; 95% CI -0.31 to 0.08), and a small e ect on aggression (SMD -0.31; 95% CI-0.49 to -0.13).
This review included two trials among patients with diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms (DeDeyn 1999; Devanand 1998), which we excluded.
The inclusion of these two trials might have diluted the e ect of conventional antipsychotics on agitation.
We found no published reviews of conventional antipsychotics on psychosis outcomes to compare to our results.
Another review of trials has addressed the mortality risk of typical antipsychotics in older patients (Hulshof 2015).
It included 14 trials among patients with dementia (independent of type of neuropsychiatric symptoms) and three trials among patients with delirium.
No increased risk of mortality was found: RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.13) and RD 0.1% (95% CI: -1.0% to 1.2%).
The higher number of included trials could explain the di erence with our results based on three trials: a slightly increased but imprecisely estimated risk of mortality (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.00).
Two reviews studied the e ect of atypical antipsychotics on behavioural symptoms in patients with dementia
These reviews di erentiated between individual antipsychotics and doses, which complicates direct comparison with our results.
Nevertheless, those reviews reported modest e ects on aggression (with or without other forms of agitation) and on psychosis.
Around half of the trials pooled in those reviews had been conducted in patients with diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, which we excluded, and that approach might have led to overestimated e icacy (Smeets 2018).
A recent network metaanalysis found that there was no single most e ective and safe atypical drug (Yunusa 2019).
Some reviews of trials about atypical antipsychotics addressed particular serious harms.
Two reviews have reported an identical increased risk of mortality with data from 15 trials (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.06-2.23)
According to these results, one in 100 patients treated with an atypical drug dies due to the drug use.
We used data from 17 trials, but the estimate was less precise (RR 1.36; 95% CI 0.90-2.05),
probably because we excluded a number of older and larger trials most of which showed an increased risk.
These trials did not enrol patients with agitation or psychosis specifically.
For the outcome mortality, it seems justifiable to include these trials, and the prior reviews provided valid evidence
In response to the 2005 review about the mortality risk of atypical antipsychotics
The studies showed that use of typical antipsychotics and especially haloperidol was related to an even higher increased risk of death (Luijendijk 2016).
In these studies, sicker and older patients received typical antipsychotics more o en than atypical antipsychotics.
The risk of dying was especially high in the first

However, none of the observational studies, all based on retrospective analyses of administrative data, had been adjusted for terminal illness (Luijendijk 2016).
This could have resulted in an overestimated risk of mortality for typical antipsychotics versus atypical antipsychotics or no antipsychotic use.

Implications for practice
There is some evidence that typical antipsychotics may decrease psychosis somewhat and that haloperidol may decrease agitation somewhat in patients with dementia.
The increased risk of somnolence and other possible adverse events, should urge doctors to be reluctant to prescribe these drugs.
Atypical antipsychotics are not e ective for psychosis in dementia, and should not be used for this indication.
The use of these atypical antipsychotic drugs should be kept to a minimum for agitation in dementia as well: these drugs may decrease agitation somewhat, but they also increase the risk of somnolence, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), any adverse events and serious adverse events.
Overall, the evidence shows that most of the decrease in agitation and psychosis seen in the drug groups can be attributed to a favourable natural course of these symptoms, as observed in the placebo groups.
This finding explains the apparent e ectiveness of the drugs seen in daily practice.
Due to the unfavourable balance between beneficial e ects and risks of adverse events for both typical and atypical antipsychotics, it is advised to look at alternative therapeutic options.
Treatment of the underlying possible psychosocial and somatic causes of agitation or psychosis should always be considered
If antipsychotics are considered for sedation in patients with severe and dangerous symptoms nonetheless, and somnolence is the intended outcome, this should be discussed openly with the patient and legal representative.

Implications for research
The precise e ect of haloperidol on psychosis and agitation in dementia is still unclear, and should be studied in su iciently large well-designed trials.
This also applies to some other frequently used typical antipsychotics such as pipamperon and zuclopentixol, and perhaps the relatively new atypical antipsychotic pimavanserin.
Future studies should be carefully designed to address the interaction with co-medications and nonpharmacological interventions.

Methods

Study design: randomised controlled trial

Study grouping: parallel group

Study duration: 12 weeks
Rescue medication: anticholinergic medication was allowed to treat EPS only if a reduction in trial medication dose was not effective.
Treatment of urinary incontinence with low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or anticholinergic medication was allowed to continue.
Low-dose oxazepam was permitted to treat agitation, provided that usage did not exceed 4 days in a 7-day period.
Short-acting sedative/hypnotic agents prescribed chronically for insomnia at baseline were permitted if the clinician judged that they could not be discontinued.
Under exceptional circumstances, initiation of night sedation for insomnia was allowed using a short-acting benzodiazepine (preferably oxazepam at the lowest effective dose).
Narcotic analgesics were permitted, provided that the dosage had been stable for at least 3 months and that they were not prescribed to control agitation or aggression.

Antipsychotic medicines are o en divided into two groups:


(outcome: psychosis); Figure 5 (outcome: somnolence); Figure 6 (outcome: extrapyramidal symptoms); Figure 7 (outcome: any adverse event); Figure 8 (outcome: any serious adverse event); Figure 9 (outcome: death); Figure 10 (outcome: discontinuation due to adverse events); Figure 11 (outcome: discontinuation (any reason)) and Figure 12 (outcome: cognitive function) do not show marked asymmetries.
Therefore reporting bias is not clearly indicated, although some funnels plots may show a tendency towards some bias in favour of atypical antipsychotics.

Absolute mean change from base- line or absolute risk in each group Comparison of mean changes or risks between groups (treatment effect)


Participants must have clinically significant agitation (including aggression) or psychosis or both at baseline.
We accepted definitions of clinically significant agitation or psychosis from the included trials based either on scores on validated measurement instruments or on reports of clinical relevance from informal carers or healthcare professionals.
Validated measurement instruments o en used to assess agitation are the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the agitation subscale of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).
The psychosis subscale of BEHAVE-AD or NPI are frequently used to assess psychosis.
