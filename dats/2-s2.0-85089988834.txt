Cerebral blood flow decrease as an early pathological mechanism in Alzheimer's disease
Therapies targeting late events in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau, have largely failed, probably because they are given after significant neuronal damage has occurred.
Biomarkers suggest that the earliest event in AD is a decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF).
This is caused by constriction of capillaries by contractile pericytes, probably evoked by oligomeric Aβ.
CBF is also reduced by neutrophil trapping in capillaries and clot formation, perhaps secondary to the capillary constriction.
The fall in CBF potentiates neurodegeneration by upregulating the BACE1 enzyme that makes Aβ and by promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Surprisingly, therefore, CBF reduction may play a crucial role in driving cognitive decline by initiating the amyloid cascade itself, or being caused by and amplifying Aβ production.
Here, we review developments in this area that are neglected in current approaches to AD, with the aim of promoting novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches.

Introduction
Thirty years of research have given us a broad understanding of many mechanisms contributing to Alzheimer's disease
Identification of the amyloid β protein (Aβ) as the major component of amyloid plaques, together with genetic evidence, initially indicated that dysfunction of the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) was the cause of Aβ plaque deposition and downstream tau tangle formation and neuronal dysfunction
Subsequent work led to the conclusion that the level of soluble Aβ oligomers, and of hyperphosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein tau that is induced by Aβ
There are established mechanisms by which Aβ oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau can contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline before synaptic and neuronal damage, and even before Aβ plaque and tau tangle deposition (Fig.
Aβ oligomers reduce glutamate uptake
This raises the extracellular glutamate level and increases neuronal excitability
Tau phosphorylation leads to soluble tau relocating from axonal microtubules into dendritic spines, where it alters postsynaptic glutamate receptor trafficking or anchoring (of both AMPA and NMDA receptors) and thus suppresses excitatory postsynaptic currents and neuronal activity
These changes may be particularly important when they affect the function of interneurons, which play a key role in generating oscillatory activity that contributes to cognitive function
Preclinical AD has therefore been conceptualised as a synaptic disease
However, individuals can be cognitively normal while having plaque levels as high as those in Alzheimer's dementia patients, and the same is true for levels of soluble Aβ oligomers
This could reflect the presence of compensating protective mutations or developmental differences in the subjects with high Aβ levels.
Alternatively, together with the fact that attempts to prevent cognitive decline-by blocking Aβ production, removing Aβ with antibodies or preventing tau phosphorylation-have all failed clinically (with one possible exception
Previously it has been suggested that the vasculature might provide such a factor, in the form of hypertension, impaired blood-brain barrier function, decreased Aβ clearance to the blood, vascular oxidative stress and inflammatory damage, or reduced neurovascular coupling at the arteriolar level
In this review, we show that new evidence reveals that a major missing variable is cerebral blood flow-and specifically its control by capillary pericytes.

Large decreases of cerebral blood flow occur early in AD
Cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism are reduced, and the brain's vascular resistance is increased, in human AD
This also occurs in humans and mice expressing the ApoE4 protein, which predisposes towards AD
The CBF reduction reaches over 50% in some brain areas
It will also lead to adenosine generation, which is known to suppress glutamate release
The transition from normal cognition to dementia, over decades, is promoted by the risk factors shown above the large red arrow.
Aβ is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of the γ secretase and β secretase (BACE1) as monomers, but these can then form soluble oligomers, which ultimately form extracellular precipitates as amyloid plaques.
Aβ oligomers inhibit astrocyte glutamate uptake (EAAT), thus potentiating the action of synaptically released glutamate (glu).
This, together with a loss of GABAergic inhibition, leads to some neurons becoming hyperexcitable.
Meanwhile, Aβ oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of axonal microtubule-associated tau, which leads to tau redistributing partly to dendrites where it disrupts trafficking of glutamate receptors and thus depresses excitation and neuronal firing.
These synaptic effects, and Aβ-and/or tau-induced loss of axonal myelin, may induce cognitive dysfunction well before synapses are lost and neurons die.
The levels of Aβ oligomers and hyperphosphorylated tau correlate better with cognitive decline than does the level of Aβ plaques will produce numerous cell biological changes including changes of the balance of protein synthesis and degradation
Although these changes could simply reflect tissue atrophy in AD
Furthermore, the observations of focal constrictions in capillaries from human AD brains
Chronic blood flow reductions of 50% are expected to cause significant cognitive changes: a sustained reduction in CBF beyond 20% in humans leads to loss of ability to sustain attention, while a reduction beyond 30% in rats impairs spatial memory
A causal influence of blood flow changes on the cognitive changes at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, before synapses or neurons are lost, is suggested by the fact that the reduction of cerebral blood flow starts early in preclinical AD [107, 180], with a faster onset than the deposition of Aβ or tau
Furthermore, these changes correlate with cognitive decline

Cerebral blood flow decreases in AD largely reflect pericytes constricting capillaries
The brain is unusual in that most of the resistance in its vascular bed is in capillaries (Fig.
Contraction of these pericytes produces localised capillary constrictions near the pericyte somata (where most of the circumferential processes of the pericytes are located
Despite the award of the Nobel Prize to Krogh
However, this debate has now largely been resolved.
The Zlokovic group
Furthermore, whereas contractility had previously been demonstrated most clearly for pericytes on the 1st-4th branch orders of capillary measured from a penetrating arteriole
iv.org/conte nt/10.1101/2020.03.26.00876 3v1].
Functional indications that capillary pericyte-mediated control of CBF is disrupted in AD have been provided by measurements of the capillary transit time of the blood, and its heterogeneity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments on humans and optical imaging experiments on AD mice have found that AD leads to both a prolongation of the capillary transit time and an increase in its heterogeneity, as if some capillary pericytes became more constricted than others
Furthermore, in humans, these changes correlate with cognitive decline (Fig.
By analysing images of brain biopsies of patients who consulted neurologists for dementia of unknown cause (Fig.
This was shown to be due to pericytes by examining how capillary diameter varied as a function of the distance along the capillary from the pericyte soma (Fig.
Patients depositing Aβ and tau tangles showed a constriction at the pericyte soma relative to positions between pericytes on the capillary.
This increased rapidly with the amount of Aβ deposited, suggesting a CBF reduction mechanism that occurs early in the development of the disease (before accumulation of Aβ in and around vascular cells-cerebral amyloid angiopathy-leads to pericyte loss), as is also seen in live imaging of CBF in AD patients
In contrast, in patients lacking Aβ and tau deposition, capillaries showed a larger diameter near the pericyte soma, perhaps because pericytes normally induce growth of the endothelial tube.
The difference in the spatial profile of capillary diameter between AD and non-AD patients was estimated to be able to generate a reduction in CBF of ~ 50%, similar to that found in AD patients in vivo
In AD mouse models, live cortex imaging through a cranial window, or reconstructing the hippocampal vasculature of fixed brains, also showed a reduction of mean capillary diameter compared to normal mice
Fig.
a Schematic diagram of the vascular bed (colour of blood represents oxygenation), indicating the relative resistance in the capillaries compared to penetrating arterioles and venules, for flow from the pial surface down an arteriole to layer 4, through the capillary bed, and returning to the pial surface through a venule
Capillary diameter can be adjusted by a population of pericytes (yellow) that are contractile, which are located on at least the first four branch orders (see labels) of the capillary bed
Blood flowing through capillaries with pericytes that are contracting to reduce the diameter will flow more slowly and so has a longer capillary transit time than blood flowing through capillaries with relaxed pericytes, thus generating capillary transit time

Mechanism of CBF decrease
Although the mechanism of the long-term pericyte-mediated constriction of capillaries that occurs in human AD brains has not yet been definitively identified, short-term application of Aβ oligomers (both Aβ 1-42 and Aβ 1-40 , at nanomolar concentrations similar to those present in AD) to human or rodent brain slices evoked capillary constriction [133] mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and activation of endothelin A (ET A ) receptors (Fig.
It is plausible that this signalling pathway is also responsible for capillary constriction in the human AD brain, since the concentrations of both ROS and endothelin-1 are known to be elevated in human AD
The locus of ROS generation is debated, with Park et al.
[141] suggesting it to be perivascular macrophages, while
ET A receptors are known to be expressed on all classes of pericyte
Release of inflammatory mediators generated during AD may also contribute to the decrease of CBF occurring.
Interleukin-1β is generated when microglial and astrocyte inflammasomes are activated by oligomeric Aβ, and (in the context of ischaemia) this cytokine has been shown to decrease CBF by releasing ET [125], although it is unknown whether this decrease is generated by pericytes.
Similarly, a mutation in the microglial TREM2 receptor (an AD susceptibility gene) that increases the production of inflammatory mediators also leads to a decrease of CBF
The neuroinflammation occurring in multiple sclerosis can also be associated with hypoperfusion that is correctable by blocking ET A receptors or voltage-gated calcium channels

The role of upstream arteries and arterioles
Constrictions of rodent cerebral arterioles and middle cerebral artery, resulting in a decrease of cerebral blood flow, have been reported to be evoked by application of exogenous Aβ 1-40
Nevertheless, in some AD mice, neurovascular coupling is impaired at the arteriole level
Furthermore, changes in the properties of arteries and arterioles upstream of the brain's capillary beds, and of the downstream venous system, could contribute to the onset of AD.
Possible contributing changes include atherosclerosis
It is possible that, rather than directly reducing CBF, these changes may promote Aβ generation or reduce its clearance

Capillary block by neutrophils and clot formation also reduce CBF in AD
The graded constriction of capillaries by pericytes is predicted to reduce CBF by 50% even in the absence of cells in the blood
In addition, two mechanisms that can produce complete occlusion of vessels have been reported to reduce CBF in AD.
By imaging cell movements in cerebral capillaries, Cruz Hernández et al.
In the AD mice 1.8% of capillariespredominantly of smaller diameter-became blocked, whereas in wild-type mice only 0.4% of capillaries were blocked.
It will be important to reproduce these results in human AD patients.
In wild-type mice, capillary block increases with ageing and can lead to vessels being pruned
Remarkably, although modelling suggested that the increased block in AD would lead to a decrease of CBF of less than 5%, applying intraperitoneally a high concentration of an antibody to a neutrophil surface marker (Ly6G) led to a relief of capillary block, an increase of blood flow by 26-32% and improved memory.
This is surprising because, at least in conditions of inflammation, antibody to Ly6G promotes neutrophil adhesion and aggregation, coagulation and decreased blood flow
The large effect of the antibody on CBF compared with the modelling predictions for relief of capillary block alone may indicate either that the modelling is over-simplified or that the antibody has effects beyond simply preventing neutrophil blocking of capillaries, perhaps on the effective viscosity of the blood (which leukocytes significantly affect
Cortes-Canteli et al.
Dabigatran preserved CBF and reduced cognitive decline in AD mice (Fig.
While a 15% decrease in CBF was seen at 40 weeks of age in AD mice (a smaller decrease than occurs in affected regions in human AD, possibly because cortical CBF was assessed by measuring it relative to thalamic CBF, which may itself be decreased
Interestingly in humans receiving oral anticoagulants, the risk of dementia is reduced by 29%
Given the profound constriction of cerebral capillaries at pericyte somata that is observed in biopsies from human patients developing AD, from a diameter of ~ 5 to ~ 2.8 μm [133], it is attractive to hypothesize that both the block of capillaries by neutrophils and the formation of clots that reduce CBF are a consequence of the reduced diameter of capillaries near pericyte somata.
Neutrophils are larger and less distensible than red blood cells and pass through capillaries more slowly
Similarly, although Cortes-Canteli et al.

Capillary constriction and reduced CBF accelerate AD onset
The capillary constriction seen in AD leads to the neural tissue becoming hypoxic
Importantly, ischaemia and hypoxia have been shown to upregulate the enzyme (BACE1) responsible for generating Aβ
This leads to more Aβ production
While these mechanistic studies were all in animals or on cell lines expressing human BACE1, the level of BACE1 and its enzymatic activity are increased in humans suffering from AD
Furthermore, an upregulation of BACE1 has been found to exist in mild cognitive impairment patients, and correlates with Aβ plaque number and cognitive decline
The upregulation of BACE1 by ischaemia and hypoxia occurs as a result of caspase-3 both increasing BACE1 mRNA level and cleaving GGA3, an adaptor protein involved in BACE1 trafficking, to decrease BACE1 degradation
Firstly, BACE1 upregulation implies that low blood flow or hypoxia-caused by a purely vascular defect, brain injury, sleep apnoea or genetic predisposition-could initiate the production of Aβ.
Indeed, bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries leads to Aβ production and a fall of metabolism in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus
This could explain why subjects with sleep apnoea, or head injury that decreases CBF
Similarly, hypertension leads to a 45% decrease of CBF in selected brain regions
For the severe ischaemia produced by stroke, however, it is debated
Some genetic variants may act by reducing CBF.
The ApoE4 variant of ApoE is the main susceptibility gene for AD, and has important vascular effects.
Expression of ApoE4 leads to a lower CBF even in cognitively normal subjects
It also promotes accelerated loss of pericytes and consequent breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which correlate with cognitive decline
Since experimentally reducing CBF also leads to pericyte loss
Secondly, once Aβ production (or an imbalance between production and removal by various mechanisms described below) has been initiated, the resulting constriction of capillaries by pericytes that it initiates (see above) will reduce CBF, causing an upregulation of BACE1 and production of more Aβ (Fig.
This positive feedback loop will amplify the production of Aβ, over an as yet unknown time course, resulting in a further imbalance between Aβ production and removal.

Capillary constriction as a link between Aβ and tau phosphorylation
Downstream of Aβ production, an important driver of cognitive decline is tau hyperphosphorylation
Importantly, ischaemia (or hypoxia), which is evoked by the pericyte-mediated capillary constriction that Aβ evokes
This is unlikely to reflect solely the increase in Aβ level evoked by ischaemia/hypoxia discussed above, because tau phosphorylation occurs in hypertensive rats (which are ischaemic and hypoxic) even without Aβ pathology [147] and is evoked by unilateral carotid artery occlusion in AD mice without a rise in Aβ 1-42 level
Major enzymes phosphorylating tau at AD-related sites include Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) and GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) [52,
For the following reasons, these may be activated by capillary constriction which evokes ischaemia/hypoxia, and thus inhibits Ca 2+ pumping out of cells and raises [Ca 2+ ] i .
Cdk5 is activated when a raised [Ca 2+ ] i activates calpain to cleave Cdk5′s regulatory subunit p35
GSK3 is activated by prolonged hypoxia via a decrease in activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway
Thus, the Aβ-evoked reduction of CBF, produced by pericyte-mediated capillary constriction in AD, could provide an important link between the rise of extracellular Aβ concentration and the hyperphosphorylation that leads to tau relocating to dendrites and impairing synaptic function (Fig.
Consequently, cognitive decline is likely to involve a reduction of CBF, whether the cognitive decline is produced ultimately by Aβ or by tau hyperphosphorylation.

Effect of reduced blood flow on Aβ clearance and blood-brain barrier (BBB) in AD
The CNS is presumably exposed mainly to Aβ generated within the CNS, rather than Aβ generated peripherally and entering across the BBB (although Aβ transfer in this direction is possible via the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)
This raises the question of how Aβ clearance will be affected by the up to 50% reductions of CBF that occur in affected areas
Four major clearance routes for Aβ from the CNS have been proposed: via efflux across endothelial cells into the blood; via bulk extracellular flow into the CSF and lymphatic vessels; via movement through the perivascular spaces of either penetrating arterioles or alternatively venules (promoted by cardiac cycle driven pulsation of arterioles and, in the case of exit along venules, also water flow through astrocytes termed the glymphatic system: see below); and via phagocytosis and subsequent degradation by microglia, astrocytes and other cells.
Injections of radioactive Aβ into the brain parenchyma have been used to try to quantify the relative importance of these removal mechanisms
Five hours after injecting Aβ 1-40 , 84.5% of it had been cleared from the CNS and 15.5% was retained.
The retained material might include Aβ in the interstitial space and Aβ (or breakdown products) sequestered in microglia, astrocytes and other cells.
Of the removed Aβ, 12.7% (i.e.
10.7% of the total injected) was removed by a process that also occurred for the inert tracer inulin, which may include all mechanisms driven by interstitial fluid flow.
The remaining 87.3% of removed Aβ was assumed to have exited the BBB across the endothelial cell layer of capillaries.
Similar experiments showed that (at 30 min after tracer injection) 30% more Aβ 1-42 than Aβ 1-40 was retained in the brain and correspondingly less was cleared across the BBB
Clearance across the BBB involved PICALM (phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein
A major role for endothelial cell LRP1 in mediating Aβ export is shown by knock-out work
There is evidence for association of PICALM and LRP1 gene variants with human AD risk (reviewed by
The decrease of CBF that occurs early in preclinical AD could decrease Aβ removal across endothelial cells, thus potentiating Aβ accumulation, by decreasing the level of proteins that mediate the removal.
For example, ischaemia will raise [Ca 2+ ] i which can result in calpain cleaving PICALM
Similarly, ischaemia leads to the endopeptidase furin cleaving LRP1
Additionally, a slowing of capillary blood flow could in principle allow Aβ that has exited into the blood to re-enter the brain parenchyma by RAGE-mediated entry across endothelial cells
The CBF decrease in AD is also expected to alter Aβ removal by the other, apparently quantitatively less important
Pulsation of penetrating arterioles during the cardiac cycle or spontaneous vasomotion has been postulated to power the removal of Aβ (in a retrograde direction with respect to CBF) in the perivascular spaces of penetrating arterioles
Arteriole pulsation is also presumed to promote water flow along the paravascular spaces of arterioles and through both aquaporin-4-expressing glial cells and the extracellular space of the brain
This flow may reach: (i) venules, where it helps to remove Aβ in the perivascular spaces of venules (in the same direction as CBF
A detailed analysis of these proposals has been provided
In AD, when CBF decreases, decreased pulsatility of the middle cerebral artery has been reported [134] and so, if this extends to penetrating arterioles, less Aβ removal by pulsation-driven mechanisms would be expected.
Indeed, removal of Aβ by the CSF, lymphatic and glymphatic systems decreases in AD
The CBF decrease induced by capillary constriction in AD may also alter microglial and astrocyte removal and degradation of Aβ.
Ischaemia followed by reperfusion (which may mimic the prolonged decrease of CBF occurring in AD) decreases microglial ramification [106, 121], which could decrease Aβ removal by these cells as surveillance of the brain parenchyma will be reduced
On the other hand, ischaemia upregulates expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2), which is a key molecule by which microglia recognise Aβ and remove it
Similarly ischaemia upregulates ABCA1, MEGF10 and GULP1, which are components of an astrocytic phagocytosis pathway [120], suggesting that the CBF reduction occurring in AD may also enhance Aβ removal by astrocytes [www.biorx
iv.org/ conte nt/10.1101/2020.03.29.00285 7v1].
Although this review focuses on the effects of the reduction of CBF that is induced by pericyte-mediated capillary constriction in AD, pericytes themselves are very sensitive to ischaemia
In AD the reduction of CBF, together with intracellular accumulation of Aβ in pericytes

The role of white matter CBF changes in the onset of AD Although most attention in the AD field focuses on changes in the grey matter, the Aβ level also increases in the white matter in AD
Consequently, the CBF decrease might exert some of its effects by generating white matter dysfunction, such as slower action potential propagation.
White matter tissue is lost before grey matter tissue in AD
Surprisingly, however, white matter capillary diameter has been reported to increase in AD
These results suggest that it will be important to determine whether, in preclinical human AD, capillary constriction by pericytes occurs in the white matter, as in the grey matter [133], or whether CBF decreases as a result of upstream vessel constriction in the grey matter [101] (possibly with dilation of white matter capillaries as an adaptive response) or for some other reason, and to establish precisely which downstream mechanisms (such as myelin loss

Implications for therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease
The discoveries that the decrease of CBF in AD occurs early in the disease
These data, including the demonstration that Aβ itself can trigger pericyte-mediated capillary constriction [133], reconcile genetic evidence for the involvement of Aβ in AD with the fact that the first change seen in AD is a decrease of cerebral blood flow
Conceivably, maintaining CBF may prevent cognitive decline if interventions are made early enough to avoid neuronal and glial damage.
Just as the risk of stroke is now reduced by giving blood pressure lowering drugs prophylactically, we expect the long-term future of AD therapy to involve-at least partly-prophylactic agents that prevent pericyte-mediated capillary constriction, and thus prevent both direct effects of CBF decreases and the amplification of Aβ production and tau phosphorylation that a fall in CBF generates.
Below, we consider approaches to achieving this and possible biomarkers to use to decide when prophylaxis should be initiated (Fig.

Preventing pericyte-mediated capillary constriction
The constriction of capillaries by pericytes may be mediated by Aβ evoking the generation of ROS that trigger the release of endothelin-1 (ET), which activates [Ca 2+ ] i -elevating contractile ET A receptors on pericytes
Indeed, in short-term experiments, blocking ROS production and ET A receptors prevented development of further Aβ-evoked constriction
However, long-term block of ROS generation is undesirable because ROS are used for signalling in many contexts, as well as for immune defence mechanisms.
Furthermore, ET A receptor activation is difficult to reverse with blockers
A better approach to preventing capillary constriction may therefore be to inhibit the contractile pathways downstream of ET A receptors by blocking the release of Ca 2+ from internal stores and increasing the activity of myosin light chain phosphatase to activate relaxation of the contractile filaments.
These twin aims can be achieved by using an agonist of guanylate cyclase receptors, such as C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP,
Indeed, CNP rapidly reverses Aβ-evoked constriction of capillaries in brain tissue
An alternative approach is to relax pericytes by inhibiting their voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (VGCCs).
Interestingly, comparing different classes of drugs used to reduce hypertension, it has been claimed that only VGCC blockers slow the progression to dementia in AD
One BBB-permeable VGCC inhibitor, nilvadipine, has been shown to restore the CBF of AD mice to normal levels
In human AD, although nilvadipine lowers peripheral blood pressure, it increases CBF in the hippocampus
Devising ways of targeting VGCC blockers specifically to CNS pericytes might enhance the efficacy of this approach.
Firstly, it would be desirable to avoid inhibiting VGCCs in neurons, which might be achievable by using bivalent drugs that also bind to proteins expressed relatively specifically by pericytes, such as PDGFRβ.
Secondly, if it were possible to avoid inhibiting VGCCs in pericytes and smooth muscle cells around peripheral blood vessels, this would probably avoid the decrease in blood pressure that stems from relaxing the vasculature all over the body.

Preventing neutrophils occluding capillaries
As noted above, Cruz Hernández et al.
The improvement of cognition in parallel with the increase in CBF in younger AD mice strongly supports the concept of devising interventions to preserve CBF in AD.
However, prolonged application of antibody to Ly6G leads to very significant neutropenia (a depletion of neutrophils) within hours
Thus, further research is needed to devise an agent which generates the blood flow increasing effect of Ly6G (which may be via more than one mechanism: see above) without causing neutropenia.
As with the approach of targeting pericyte-mediated capillary constriction discussed above, it will also be necessary to consider the overall effect on blood pressure caused by a manipulation that decreases vascular resistance throughout the body.
potential therapies to prevent or reverse the CBF decrease arising when Ca 2+ activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to evoke pericyte-mediated capillary constriction.
These include blocking pericyte voltage-gated calcium channels to block Ca 2+ -evoked constriction, raising pericyte cGMP level (by activating guanylate cyclase receptors, blue membrane protein) to stimulate myosin light chain phosphate (MLCP) and thus evoke dilation, disrupting neutrophil surface interactions with endothelial cells or other cells using antibodies (if this approach can be used without inducing neutropenia), or blocking thrombus formation with dabigatran

Use of anticlotting agents
The prolonged use of anticoagulants to improve cerebral blood flow and outcome in patients liable to developing AD
AD often coexists with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), for which asymptomatic micro-bleeds, bleeding into the cortical sulci and large symptomatic lobar cerebral haemorrhages can be complications.
These are thought to be due to a breakdown in microvasculature integrity as Aβ accumulates along vessel walls and injures them
Criteria exist for diagnosing CAA
However, further research is required to determine whether there are specific CAA-related biomarkers that would help clinicians to recognise and exclude those patients who would be put at an unacceptable risk of serious intracerebral haemorrhage from anticoagulation, before it could be adopted as a widespread prophylactic treatment for AD.

Relevance of these approaches to other neurodegenerative disorders
The Aβ-evoked constriction of capillaries by pericytes may involve ROS generation that evokes the release of endothelin-1
ROS generation also occurs when α-synuclein accumulates in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD)
Indeed, PD and LBD are associated with decreased cerebral blood flow
Accordingly, the therapeutic approaches outlined above may also be relevant to these disorders.

Choice of biomarker for initiating treatment
To date, candidate treatments for AD have almost certainly been initiated too late, after irreversible damage to the brain has occurred, as a result of making treatment decisions based on significant observable cognitive decline.
If we are to move towards more preventative treatments, they will need to be started as soon as the earliest changes occur in the disease, raising the question of what biomarkers to use to trigger treatment.
Assuming that pericyte-mediated capillary constriction is indeed a very early event in the onset of AD (see Fig.
Markers of cell damage, such as CSF levels of neurofilament light chain which may indicate damage to white matter axons
Techniques that look directly at deleterious decreases of CBF (which may follow a period of adaptive hyperperfusion in some brain regions
In human patients, MRI can be used to measure CBF.
Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI with an injected tracer has been used to quantify changes of blood capillary transit time (and its heterogeneity) in early AD
If these measurements could be performed using non-invasive (i.e.
without an injected tracer) arterial spin label MRI, then it would provide a method to assess changes in how pericytes control blood flow in different capillaries.
An alternative, more direct, observation of pericyte-mediated capillary constriction may be possible by imaging retinal capillaries through the intact cornea, using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), which has been used to detect decreases in neurovascular coupling at the arterial level
OCTA could perhaps thus provide a screening method for detecting pericyte malfunction early in preclinical AD.
Aβ plaques are reported to be deposited in the retina before being deposited in the brain
Thus, pericyte-mediated capillary constriction evoked by Aβ oligomers should also be detectable early on as a focal reduction of capillary diameter around pericytes (cf [133]), although this reduction is likely to be close to the limit of resolution of the OCTA technique and this approach would require validation with post-mortem immunohistochemistry.

Conclusions
With the discoveries that a decrease of cerebral blood flow is the earliest change to occur in AD
The reduction of CBF produced by pericytes constricting capillaries, along with ensuing decreases in CBF as a result of capillary occlusion by neutrophils and thrombi, is an important dysfunction in AD that potentially opens up new therapeutic approaches and new screening possibilities.
Initial evidence indicates that reversing this reduction of CBF can restore cognitive function, provided that damage to synapses, neurons and circuits has not advanced significantly.
Consequently, in addition to manipulation of other effects of Aβ and tau, devising screening tests to allow therapeutic intervention to maintain CBF should be a key aim for the future treatment of AD.
