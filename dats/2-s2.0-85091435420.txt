Risk prediction of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease implies an oligogenic architecture
Genetic association studies have identified 44 common genome-wide significant risk loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
However, LOAD genetic architecture and prediction are unclear.
Here we estimate the optimal P-threshold (P optimal ) of a genetic risk score (GRS) for prediction of LOAD in three independent datasets comprising 676 cases and 35,675 family history proxy cases.
We show that the discriminative ability of GRS in LOAD prediction is maximised when selecting a small number of SNPs.
Both simulation results and direct estimation indicate that the number of causal common SNPs for LOAD may be less than 100, suggesting LOAD is more oligogenic than polygenic.
The best GRS explains approximately 75% of SNP-heritability, and individuals in the top decile of GRS have ten-fold increased odds when compared to those in the bottom decile.
In addition, 14 variants are identified that contribute to both LOAD risk and age at onset of LOAD.

A
lzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia.
The majority (~90-95%) of AD cases are sporadic and occur after 65 years of age (late-onset Alzheimer's disease, LOAD)
The reported heritability of LOAD liability is 58.0%
(95% CI 19.0-87.0%)
from twin studies 2 , and its estimated common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based heritability on the liability scale (h 2 SNPðlÞ ) ranges from 0.13 to 0.33
APOE alleles (ɛ2, ɛ3 and ɛ4, determined by two coding variants, rs7412 and rs429358 from chromosome 19), especially APOE ɛ4, explain around a quarter of the total heritability
In addition to APOE alleles, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 40 LOAD-associated risk loci
Similar to other brain-related diseases (e.g., schizophrenia
A genetic risk score (GRS) derived from 13,959 cases and 35,600 controls based on a large number of SNPs (i.e., SNPs with P GWAS ≤ 0.5) was reported to have better prediction accuracy than using SNPs selected with a more stringent P GWAS .
However, a recent study
The P optimal of GRS on diseases (e.g., schizophrenia) was previously reported to be related to the discovery sample size
Nevertheless, it was observed that the best fitting P-value for GRS prediction of schizophrenia changed little from 0.2 with 2615 cases and 3338 controls to 0.1 with 32,838 cases and 44,357 controls
The reasons for this inconsistency in P optimal for LOAD (from 0.5 to ~10 -5 ) across studies is unclear, in particular whether it may be solely due to the increase of discovery sample size.
These conflicting reports on the number of common risk variants associated with LOAD led us to investigate the genetic architecture of the disease, and to compare the prediction accuracy between a multiple SNP genetic predictor of LOAD (including or excluding APOE) versus APOE alone.
For LOAD, age at onset (AAO) is also heritable.
Its heritability is reported to be 0.42 (s.e.
= 0.04)
The effect size of each SNP in GHS is usually estimated based on Cox proportional hazards regression (survival analysis)
Previous studies have identified four genomic regions (APOE, BIN1, MS4A and PICALM) with SNPs genome-wide significantly (P < 5 × 10 -8 ) associated with LOAD AAO, all of these being LOAD risk loci
A direct comparison of LOAD risk and AAO on the same data may provide new insight into the genetics of LOAD.
In the present study, we investigate the prediction pattern of GRS to estimate the optimal P-value cut-off, and thereby quantify the genetic architecture of LOAD.
To ensure the robustness of our results, we use four sets of (overlapping) GWAS summary statistics to calculate the GRS (with or without SNPs from chromosome 19) and examine their prediction patterns in three independent datasets (out-of-sample prediction).
The results suggest that LOAD is oligogenic compared to other disorders of the brain, since only a small number of common SNPs are conditionally associated with LOAD.
Furthermore, we compare the prediction performance of GRS against APOE and find that individuals in the upper decile of GRS have higher disease risk than those who are APOE ɛ4 heterozygous carriers.
Finally, risk of LOAD and AAO of LOAD are found to be genetically similar.

Results
Current GWAS summary statistics on late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
To date, eight studies
As expected, the number of reported loci increased with effective sample size (Fig.
We collected four sets of GWAS summary statistics from the public domain to calculate GRS
They are based on samples from stage 1 in Lambert et al.
These summary statistics are from samples with partial overlap and some of them are independent (i.e., samples from Lambert et al.
Genetic correlations between these summary statistics estimated by LDscore regression (LDSC)
Among them, two estimates (genetic correlations between Lambert et al. (stage 1)
This discrepancy was not expected since they were all GWAS results on the same trait and had overlapping samples.
LDSC assumes that the effect sizes of SNPs follow a normal distribution, we therefore removed all SNPs from chromosome 19 to avoid the potential effect of APOE when estimating the genetic correlation.
We also re-calculated the sample size for each SNP based on the standard error of its effect size ("Methods").
We used the flag "--intercept-gencov" to constrain the intercept by our calculated value while computing the genetic correlation.
We found that the estimated genetic correlation between Marioni et al. (UKB)
= 0.11), and the genetic correlation between Lambert et al. (stage 1)
= 0.11), both not significantly (P > 0.05) different from unity.
We noted that the sample size and therefore the weights used in the meta-analysis of Jansen et al.
Genetic risk score in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
We used 1,056,156 SNPs (1,056,154 HapMap3 SNPs and two APOE SNPs: rs429358 and rs7412) shared between all four sets of summary statistics to calculate the GRS (GRS full ).
We retained HapMap3 SNPs in our study since they are common (minor allele frequency >0.01), well-imputed and available across all GWASs.
For each set of summary statistics, we chose different P-value thresholds (1 × 10 -8 , 1 × 10 -7 , 1 × 10 -6 , 1 × 10 -5 , 3 × 10 -5 , 1 × 10 -4 , 3 × 10 -4 , 1 × 10 -3 , 3 × 10 -3 , 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1) and performed LD clumping (R 2 = 0.01, window size = 1 Mbp) to select nearindependent SNPs using PLINK
Based on the selected SNPs, we calculated the weighted sum of the SNP dosage and used it as the GRS for each individual
We evaluated the performance of GRS full using samples from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Study (AIBL, 216 cases and 631 controls), the Sydney Memory and Ageing study (Sydney MAS, 77 cases and 588 controls) and the UKB (383 cases and 1915 controls) (Table
We found that the prediction accuracy (R 2 ) on the liability scale (Fig.
Since the prediction pattern could be affected by the SNPs with major effects (e.g., APOE ɛ4 and ɛ2) (Supplementary Fig.
Although the R 2 reduced compared to that from GRS full , the optimal P-value threshold remained small (Fig.
The P-value thresholds that maximised out-of-sample prediction (R 2 ) in AIBL were 1 × 10 -8 (Lambert et al., stage 1
Samples from UKB were only evaluated based on summary statistics from Lambert et al. (stage 1)
Results based on Sydney MAS were highly variable (Fig.
We found that the odds ratio between individuals in the top 50% of GRS no19 and those in the bottom 50% (Supplementary Fig.
We further explored the GRS no19 prediction performance of Lambert et al. (stage 1)
Although the prediction accuracy is small, its pattern is consistent with that from other cohorts (Fig.
Furthermore, we used less stringent R 2 (0.2) to perform LD clumping so that more SNPs could be included in GRS no19 .
We found no improvement in prediction accuracy or change in the pattern (Supplementary Fig.
In addition, we estimated the optimal fraction of causal SNPs for prediction using LDpred
Given the LD between SNPs, the number of effective independent markers would be even lower.
The highest prediction accuracy of GRS full (based on 22 SNPs, Supplementary Table
1000 replications) of variance explained on the liability scale ("Methods"), with APOE (rs429358 and rs7412) contributing the majority (17.4%, 95% bootstrap CI 11.3-25.0%,
1000 replications).
We compared this prediction accuracy with the transformed common SNP-based heritability on the liability scale (h 2 SNPðlÞ ) reported in previous studies (ranges from 8.9 to 31.2% across studies)
The SNP-heritability was estimated by different methods and our simulations ("Methods") suggested that when most of the SNP-based heritability was explained by a single variant, the estimated value from LDSC was lower than the simulated heritability, but the result from genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) was unbiased (Supplementary Fig.
Therefore, only h 2 SNPðlÞ based on GREML is considered here.
We found that the prediction accuracy achieved could account for around three quarters of inverse-variance  Fig.
Sample size is calculated as the total number of cases and controls under a balanced design (50% cases and 50% controls).
Genes associated with LOAD were collected from different studies.
They are the closest genes to SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.01) genome-wide significantly (P< 5 × 10 -8 ) associated with LOAD.

weighted average of h 2 SNPðlÞ (26.2%, 95% CI 22.7-29.7%),
suggesting that the best GRS full could explain most of the SNPheritability.
Besides, the best GRS full accounts for one-third of the reported total heritability (58.0%, 95% CI 19.0-87.0%)
from twin studies 2 (Supplementary Fig.
However, the differences between the prediction accuracy of APOE, GRS full , h 2 SNPðlÞ , and total heritability are not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
Genetic architecture and optimal threshold in GRS.
The prediction pattern of GRS on LOAD is different from that of polygenic traits like BMI
Our simulation study suggests that this difference is related to their distinct genetic architectures, and that LOAD is much less polygenic compared to these other complex traits.
In our simulations, we randomly selected 100,000 unrelated individuals from the UKB and simulated traits with an SNP-heritability of 9% (close to the reported SNP-heritability of LOAD excluding the effect of APOE), varying the number of causal variants ("Methods")
We selected 10,000 individuals as a (hold-out) test set and chose different number of individuals (from 10,000 to 90,000) as a training set.
We ran GWAS on the training set and examined the prediction pattern of the GRS on the test set.
We observed an increase in the optimal P-value threshold of GRS as the number of causal SNPs increases (from 16 to 131,072) (Fig.
The pattern of GRS on LOAD was consistent with simulations on fewer than 256 causal SNPs (P optimal < 1 × 10 -5 ).
In addition, we used a recently developed Bayesian regression method (SBayesR 33 ) that estimates the number of SNPs with non-zero effect size from GWAS summary statistics.
We only used the Marioni et al. (meta)
We estimated the number of SNPs with non-zero effects on LOAD to be 99 (s.e.
= 6), which represents only ~0.01% of HapMap3 SNPs.
This number decreased to 56 (s.e.
= 6), if SNPs from chromosome 19 are removed before the Comparison of prediction performance between GRS and APOE.
For coronary artery disease, GRS could identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations
Here, we compared the prediction performance of APOE with GRS (based on the most stringent P-value threshold: 1 × 10 -8 ).
In AIBL, individuals who are APOE ɛ4 heterozygous carriers were found to have a higher disease risk (43.6%) than those in the highest decile of a GRS no19 (35.7%).
Using both APOE SNPs and variants on other chromosomes, the disease risk of individuals in the top decile of the GRS full was 57.1% (Fig.
The odds ratio was 10.0 (95% CI 4.5-22.0)
compared to individuals in the bottom decile (Fig.
This disease risk is larger than the individuals who are APOE ɛ4 heterozygous carriers (43.6%), but smaller than individuals who are homozygous for APOE ɛ4 (59.6%).
Nevertheless, individuals in the last percentile of GRS full have larger disease risk (75.0%) than individuals who are homozygous for APOE ɛ4.
We observed the same pattern in the Sydney MAS and UKB samples (Fig.
Across the different target datasets, around 1% improvement of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) could be achieved by a GRS full (ranges from 57.1 to 73.2%) compared to APOE.
Ignoring SNPs from chromosome 19, the AUC based on GRS no19 ranges from 51.8% (95% CI 51.4-52.3%) to 59.0% (95% CI 54.2-63.1%),
all of them are significantly different (P-value < 0.05) from 50% (Supplementary Fig.
Genetic similarity between LOAD risk and AAO.
To explore whether there are more genomic loci associated with both LOAD risk and AAO, we tried to detect new AAO loci and investigate whether they have been identified to be associated with LOAD risk.
We used the parental AAO of LOAD as reported in UKB as a proxy of AAO and performed genome-wide survival analysis (GWSA) on maternal and paternal AAO of LOAD separately ("Methods").
Six independent (pairwise R 2 < 0.01) genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10 -8 ) SNPs were identified after metaanalysing the parental AAO results (Supplementary Fig.
Furthermore, we meta-analysed the UKB results with previously reported AAO GWSA summary statistics
Among these, 14 loci were genome-wide significantly associated (P < 5 × 10 -8 ) with LOAD risk, the remaining two SNPs also have P-values <5 × 10 -5 .
The correlation between the effect sizes of the 16 SNPs on disease risk and AAO was 1.00 (s.e.
= 0.02), suggesting the risk alleles of LOAD also decrease the AAO of LOAD.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the predictive performance of GRS on LOAD using four sets of summary statistics and applied them to three independent datasets.
We found a clear pattern in that prediction performance of GRS increases with the use of a more stringent P-value threshold for SNP selection and therefore with fewer SNPs in the model.
Consistent with simulations and direct estimation (SBayesR), we conclude that a relatively small number (in the hundreds) of common variants contribute to LOAD risk.
APOE was responsible for most of the prediction accuracy of LOAD, but other variants also show significant prediction accuracy (maximum R 2 on liability scale = 2.0%, 95% bootstrap CI 0.5-4.5%,
1000 replications).
Genetic variants that contribute to the risk of disease are also associated with an earlier AAO.
Taking all of our results together, we conclude that the empirical data are consistent with an oligogenic common variant  Fig.
Causal SNPs were selected from 1,037,804 HapMap3 SNPs.
For each scenario, we generated a phenotype of 100,000 individuals based on a specified number of causal SNPs (e.g., 128) with heritability 0.09.
We randomly selected 10,000 individuals as the test set.
Based on the unselected individuals, we randomly chose 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 and 90,000 individuals separately as training sets and used them to perform GWAS.
We examined the performance of genetic risk score (based on LD clumping with 80 separate P-value thresholds) on the test set (N test = 10,000) and selected the optimal P-value threshold.

architecture of LOAD (~0.01% of SNPs with MAF > 1% have non-zero effects on LOAD).
This is smaller than the polygenicity estimate of 0.26% (s.e.
= 0.19%) reported in a previous study
However, considering the standard error of that estimate, it is not significantly (P > 0.05) different from our estimate of 0.01% (s.e.
= 0.0006%).
Besides, this architecture contrasts with many other common diseases and disorders which are highly polygenic.
For comparison, we applied the SBayesR method
= 2.4%), 3.2% (s.e.
= 0.8%) and 16.4% (s.e.
= 5.8%), respectively.
In addition, their optimal P-value thresholds of GRS for these diseases were all ≥0.05
LOAD was previously labelled as polygenic by Escott-Price et al.
However, most of the control samples (~6000 out of 7277) in their test dataset (Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer's Disease consortium) were younger than 60 years old when their disease status was reported, and the ages of most cases were over 75 years
Treating these samples as controls might bias prediction results, since the typical AAO of LOAD is above 65 years.
In addition, sample overlap between training and test sets would also lead to a large optimal P-value threshold.
In Jansen et al.
For a test set that overlaps with the training set (accounting ∼3% of training set
Our simulations show that when the test set is part of a training set, the best Pvalue threshold is close to 1 (Supplementary Fig.
Therefore, taken together, we conclude that the previous report of LOAD being polygenic is likely biased by sample overlap and/or the ascertainment of controls that may go on to develop LOAD at a later stage.
There is a wide range of LOAD SNP-heritability reported across studies, ranging from 8.9 to 31.2% (Supplementary Table
Except for the difference due to the estimation methods, such differences could also be caused by differences in age distributions between datasets (Supplementary Fig.
Based on the same method, the estimated heritability in datasets with younger individuals was found to be larger than that using older individuals (Supplementary Table
Another potential reason could be heterogeneity between datasets, for example with respect to diagnostic criteria.
For the summary statistics based on meta-analysis in particular, this heterogeneity would attenuate heritability estimates
There are a number of limitations in this study: (1) We focused on the additive effect of common variants, and did not explore non-additive genetic or gene by environment effects; (2) our analysis was based on summary statistics from a meta-analysis of a number of datasets.
Heterogeneity (e.g., based on different diagnostic criteria) and measurement error (e.g., proxy cases from UKB are self-reported) in these datasets (and those used in this study) might have affected our result.
The estimated number of conditionally associated SNPs could be smaller than reported if there is heterogeneity and/or measurement error; (3) the sample sizes of the datasets with real cases and controls used in this study are small, a larger dataset would be required to test the significance of the difference in prediction accuracy (R 2 ) between GRSs based on optimal P-value and other P-value thresholds; (4) rare variants were not considered.
There are several genes with rare mutations with large effects on LOAD
Those mutations contribute little to heritability and to prediction accuracy in population samples because of their low frequency.
Larger GWAS samples should allow identification of the remaining undiscovered common SNPs associated with LOAD but also offer the opportunity to identify rarer SNPs (e.g., MAF in 0.001-0.1) in order to refine and improve the GRS.

Methods
Study populations.
AIBL: we selected 216 cases and 631 controls (participants with mild cognitive impairment were regarded as controls) with genotype information from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study (Table
We removed SNPs with minor allele frequency smaller than 0.01, SNP missingness rate larger than 0.05, and not passing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test (P < 5 × 10 -6 ).
Genotypes were imputed to the sequencing data from the Haplotype Reference Consortium (r1.1) using the Sanger Imputation Service (
A total of 6,972,431 SNPs with info score larger than 0.8 were selected after imputation.
Data were collected by the AIBL study group.

Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Sydney MAS: we selected 77 cases and 588 controls (including participants with mild cognitive impairment) with genotype information from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study 44 (Table
We applied the same quality control steps and imputation as in that in AIBL.
In total, 4,303,719 SNPs with info score larger than 0.8 were selected after imputation.
Acquisition of genetic data has been described previously
Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and Sydney MAS was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales (# HC14327).
UKB family history: UKB data (
Family history of AD was ascertained via self-report.
Participants were asked "Has/did your father ever suffer from Alzheimer's disease/ dementia?"
(Data-Field: 20107) and "Has/did your mother ever suffer from Alzheimer's disease/dementia?" (Data-Field: 20110).
Self-report data from the initial assessment visit (2006-2010), the first repeat assessment visit (2012-2013) and the imaging visit (2014+) were aggregated.
We only included participants with parents older than 60 years or whose parents died after 60 years of age.
Only genetically unrelated individuals (genetic relationship correlation <0.05) with European ancestry were selected.
In total, 22,557/13,118 individuals with maternal/ paternal LOAD were selected as proxy case samples, 231,767/241,206 individuals without maternal/paternal LOAD were selected as proxy control samples.
Imputation and QC steps on SNPs have been detailed elsewhere
UKB: additional information on LOAD was obtained for participants themselves from UKB.
Briefly, 383 participants with a diagnosis of "Alzheimer's disease" (ICD10 code: G30.1 and G30.9) or "Dementia in Alzheimer's disease" (ICD10 code: F00.1 and F00.9) or "dementia/Alzheimer's/cognitive impairment" (UKB Data-Coding 6: 1263) were selected.
We randomly selected 1915 participants (with age at baseline greater than 60) from the remaining samples as controls.
These samples were used as a test set.
Informed consent was obtained by UKB from all participants, and the ethics approval for the UKB study was obtained from the North West Centre for Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0382).

Heritability and prediction accuracy on liability scale.
The heritability on liability scale (h 2 SNPðlÞ ) can be transformed from heritability on observed scale (h 2 o , treating case/control as 1/0) 47 :
where K is the population disease prevalence, P is the proportion of cases in the ascertained sample and z is the height of the standard normal probability density function at the truncation threshold t which corresponds to probability K. z can be calculated using the R functions qnorm() and dnorm(): t = qnorm(1 -K) and z = dnorm(t).
The formula is more complicated for transforming prediction accuracy on the observed scale (R 2 o ) to the liability scale (R 2 l )
where C is Kð1ÀKÞ z 2

We used 5% as the population disease lifetime prevalence in this study
The following equation was used to transform h 2 SNPðl K1 Þ estimated using population prevalence K1 to h 2 SNPðl K2 Þ using population prevalence K2:
where P is the proportion of cases, p is the minor allele frequency and y is the disease (1 for case and 0 for control).
We define P as 0.5 so that it is the sample size for a balanced design.
Relationship between sample overlap and prediction pattern.
We randomly selected 90,000 unrelated individuals from UKB to simulate a trait with heritability 0.2 and 128 causal SNPs (close to the estimated number SNPs with non-zero effect on LOAD) selected from 1,056,156 SNPs (1,056,154 HapMap3 SNPs and two APOE SNPs: rs429358 and rs7412).
We chose one of the selected SNPs as a major mutation, and assumed that it explained 20, 50 and 80% of the heritability.
We performed GWAS on these individuals (training dataset) to get the summary statistics.
We randomly selected a proportion of individuals from the training dataset (fraction ranges from 1 to 20%) as a test set and examined the prediction pattern of GRS (based on the GWAS summary statistics) on this test set.
