Sinapic Acid Alleviates Oxidative Stress and Neuro-Inflammatory Changes in Sporadic Model of Alzheimer’s Disease in Rats
The role of oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation and cholinergic dysfunction is already established in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Sinapic acid (SA), a hydroxylcinnamic acid derivative, has shown neuro-protective effects.
The current study evaluates the neuro-protective potential of SA in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) induced cognitive impairment in rats.
Male Wistar rats were bilaterally injected with ICV-STZ.
SA was administered intragastrically once daily for three weeks.
Rats were divided into sham, ICV-STZ, STZ + SA (10 mg/kg), STZ + SA (20 mg/kg) and SA per se (20 mg/kg).
Behavioral tests were assessed on day 0 and 21 days after STZ.
Later, rats were sacrificed for biochemical parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression and neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
The results showed that SA 20 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) improved cognitive impairment as assessed by Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests.
SA 20 mg/kg reinstated the altered levels of GSH, MDA, TNF-α and IL-1β in the cortex and hippocampus.
STZ-induced decreased expression of ChAT and neuronal loss were also significantly (p < 0.05) improved with SA.
Our results showed that SA exhibits neuro-protection against ICV-STZ induced oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, cholinergic dysfunction and neuronal loss, suggesting its potential in improving learning and memory in patients of AD.

Introduction
Approximately 80% of cases of dementia are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), making it the major form of dementia
According to the world Alzheimer's report, the numbers of AD patients are expected to increase from 56 million in 2020 to 88 million by 2050.
Thus, AD poses not only a great social impact, but would also result in a huge economic burden to healthcare worldwide
Current treatments with tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil and memantine neither halt nor delay the progression of the disease, rather they only provide symptomatic relief
The majority of the patients with AD have late onset called sporadic AD (>60 year), and less than 1% of patients have inherited mutations in genes that affect the processing of amyloid beta (Aβ) and these patients develop the disease at an early age (<60 year) called familial AD
Several mechanisms are involved in neuronal degeneration in sporadic AD, including oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuro-inflammation, apoptosis and genetic factors
Consequently, these multiple factors may interact and exacerbate each other, leading to neuronal dysfunction and Brain Sci.

Therefore, there is an unmet need for developing novel therapies targeting these multiple pathways.
Familial AD is mimicked using transgenic models whereas the more prevalent but late onset sporadic AD is mimicked credibly by streptozotocin (STZ) injections.
Low dose intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of STZ in rodents induces an insulin resistance-like brain state including behavioral, neurochemical and histological features resembling sporadic AD
ICV-STZ produces neuronal damage through the production of reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species, neuro-inflammation, impaired insulin signaling, hyper-phosphorylation of tau and amyloid beta proteins
Impaired brain energy metabolism reduces synthesis of acetyl coenzyme A and acetylcholine.
Consequently, it interrupts the cholinergic transmission in neurons, ultimately leading to cholinergic deficits along with reduced choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)
Neuro-inflammation along with oxidative stress plays an important role in the exacerbation and progression of AD by activation of astrocytes and microglia, releasing cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, leading to Aβ generation and the development of AD
Sinapic acid (SA), a natural herbal phenolic acid compound, is present in oranges, grapefruits, and cranberries or herbs like Sinapis alba, canola, mustard seed and rapeseed
SA has been reported to be neuro-protective against amyloid beta induced AD and kainic acid-induced neuronal damage
Furthermore, it prevented cognitive impairment in scopolamine induced amnesic mouse model
In addition, SA has shown anti-inflammatory activity in carbon tetrachloride induced acute hepatic injury in rats
Therefore, SA may have the potential to impede the vicious cycle of oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation and cholinergic deficiency and can thus put forward a new option for the treatment of AD.
Hence, in the present study, we hypothesized that SA may exhibit neuro-protection in ICV-STZ induced cognitive impairment.
Behavioral parameters for spatial memory and memory consolidation, biochemical estimations of oxidative biomarkers, pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α, expression of ChAT and neuron loss in the hippocampus were assessed in order to provide insight into the neuro-protective effects of SA in ICV-STZ induced sporadic AD model in rats.

ICV-STZ Injection
After baseline behavioral assessment, rats were anaesthetized using chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, intra-peritoneal route).
The dorsal surface of the skull was shaved; povidone-iodine solution was applied, followed by 70% alcohol.
Animals were placed in a stereotactic frame.
After a midline sagittal incision, the skull was exposed to reach bregma.
Burr holes were made bilaterally, over lateral ventricles, with the help of a dental micro-motor machine using the coordinates of 0.8 mm posterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to sagittal suture, and 3.6 mm ventral to dura, as described earlier
STZ was prepared fresh by dissolving in normal saline immediately before administration.
With the help of a Hamilton syringe, STZ was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg bilaterally on day 1
To ensure dispersal of STZ, the Hamilton syringe was left in place for few minutes following the injection.
After surgery, rats were kept in individual cages to recover from anesthesia and two rats per cage were housed.

Drug Treatment
The rats were divided into the following groups; (i) sham (all surgical procedures except STZ administration), (ii) STZ (3 mg/kg, on day 1), (iii) SA 10 (STZ at day 1 + SA 10 mg/kg, p.o for 21 days), (iv) SA 20 (STZ at day 1 + SA 20 mg/kg, p.o for 21 days), and (v) Per se (only SA 20 mg/kg for 21 days).
SA was dissolved in 20% tween-80 and administered once daily for 21 days after ICV-STZ injection and same volume of vehicle was given to sham and STZ groups.
Neurobehavioral parameters were assessed on day 0 and 21 days after ICV injection of STZ.
The animals were sacrificed on day 21.

Behavioural Assessment



Neuro-behavioral Tests
For assessment of cognitive impairment, the well accepted Morris water maze test (to assess spatial memory) and passive avoidance paradigm (to assess maintenance of short term memory) were performed on day 0 and 21 days after STZ injection.

 Morris Water Maze Test
To test the spatial memory, the Morris water maze test was performed
The Morris water tank was divided into 4 quadrants (1, 2, 3 and 4) virtually with a platform in the 4th quadrant.
Each animal received four trials for four days of 120 s each and, on the fifth day, a retention trial was performed.
During the retention trial, the platform was taken out and the duration was reduced to 60 s.
The Morris water maze retention trial was performed on day 0 and 21 days after ICV-STZ injection.
The latency to reach the platform (escape latency) and time spent in the 4th quadrant was recorded and analyzed using the Any-maze video tracking system.



Passive Avoidance Test
Passive avoidance apparatus was used to test memory retention deficit
Briefly, the rat was placed in the lighted chamber during the acquisition trial.
The guillotine door was opened after 30 s of habituation.
The time the rat took to enter the dark chamber, called initial latency, was noted.

However, the treatment with sinapic acid significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated the STZ-induced neuronal loss as compared to the STZ group.

Discussion
The results of the present study revealed that intracerebroventricular injection of STZ mimicked AD like behavioral changes including decreased time spent in the fourth quadrant, enhanced escape latency in the Morris water maze test, decreased retention latency in the passive avoidance test, impaired oxidative status accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased ChAT expression in the hippocampus.
Administration of sinapic acid for 21 days attenuated the STZ-induced changes in behavioral and oxidative parameters, inflammatory cytokines and levels of ChAT.
The current therapies for AD primarily focus on restoring cholinergic transmission or inhibiting NMDA receptor and amelioration of symptoms
Since oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation are early features of AD pathogenesis, targeting them and replenishing the cholinergic transmission may provide a novel therapy in AD
In the recent past, polyphenolic compounds have been explored extensively because of their antioxidant properties
SA is a hydroxycinnamic acid compound with proven anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
Hence, the current study was planned to evaluate the neuro-protective effect of SA in ICV-STZ-induced cognitive impairment in rats.
ICV-STZ is a well-accepted experimental model to mimic sporadic AD.
In the present study, bilateral ICV-STZ injection induced cognitive impairments, as shown by behavioral and pathological alterations, mimicking sporadic AD in rats
Further, the brain has greater metabolic activity, high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, less glutathione and high oxygen consumption, making it explicitly available to free radical attack
Imbalance between the production of reactive oxidizing metabolites and their elimination by the enzymatic or non-enzymatic antioxidant system causes the state of oxidative stress
An excess of free radicals causes damage to the membrane's lipids and proteins, which eventually leads to a decrease in GSH and an increase in MDA levels in the brain
Moreover, MDA and aldehydes are associated with neuronal death by modulating the ATPases associated with ionic transfers as well as calcium homeostasis
Dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, an intrinsic ionic regulator, plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of AD as the calcium binding protein calmodulin, and the calmodulin binding protein neurogranin, are reported to be involved in AD associated long-term depression.
Calmodulin inhibitors improved cognitive functions in an animal model of vascular dementia
Further, disturbed calcium homeostasis induced increased intracellular calcium and calmodulin leads to activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, responsible for long term depression associated with AD
Glutamate receptor over-activation is also responsible for ChAT inhibition
Taken together, these events ultimately lead to a state of neuroinflammation and cholinergic dysfunction.
STZ-induced cognitive impairment was assessed by behavioral tests.
Morris water maze and passive avoidance paradigms are well accepted behavioral tests used in experimental AD research.
The widespread conformational validity of the Morris water maze as a measure of spatial navigation and predictive memory, and use of the passive avoidance test, which assesses the basic capability to learn and remember the existence of a shock stimulus, with the advantages of minimal practice and quick learning make both of these behavioral tests suitable to assess cognitive decline in a sporadic AD model
The escape latency or the time required to locate the platform zone was more, whereas the time spent in the target quadrant was less in STZ injected rats, indicating memory impairment.
The results suggest that SA improved cognitive impairment as shown by the shorter escape latency and longer time spent in the fourth quadrant.
Similarly, in the passive avoidance test, there was reduced retention latency in the STZ group and SA significantly attenuated the reduced retention latency.
Hence, SA improved cognitive impairment as evidenced by the improvement in behavioral test performance.
In AD, cognitive impairment is associated with reduced antioxidants, high levels of oxidized proteins and lipid peroxidation end products, and the formation of free radicals such as peroxides, aldehydes and oxidative modifications in mitochondria
Excessive oxidative stress induces mitochondrial impairment and causes a decrease in ATP production, altered calcium homeostasis and a further increase in reactive oxygen species production.
These events lead to DNA, lipid and protein damage and long-term increase can cause mitochondrial DNA mutation, ultimately progressing the disease severity
Previous studies also substantiate ICV-STZ-induced decreased GSH and increased MDA levels in the cortex and hippocampus
The results of our study are in accordance with the above mentioned studies wherein SA treatment significantly counteracted the altered levels of oxidative stress markers.
This effect may be attributed to the free radical scavenging ability and phenoxyl hydrogen atom donating capacity of SA, leading to the neutralization of free radicals to form phenoxyl radicals
Neuro-inflammation, as reflected by astrogliosis and microglial activation, is another prominent feature contributing to AD pathogenesis
The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β play crucial roles in AD neuro-inflammation
In previous studies along with studies from our laboratory, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were increased in the cortex and hippocampus after STZ injection
In agreement with the above results, in the present study as well, the levels of both pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the STZ group as compared to the sham group.
SA treatment significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in the cortex and hippocampus.
The anti-inflammatory properties of SA are most likely be mediated by its ability to suppress NF-κB p65 activation, which further reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines
Antioxidant effects and anti-inflammatory activity of SA may be responsible for the retrieval in cognitive functions.
Acetylcholine, a major cholinergic neurotransmitter in the brain, plays an important role in learning and memory.
Its physiological action is terminated by acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
Notably, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the rate limiting enzyme in ACh formation, catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to choline
Henceforth, depletion of ChAT activity in the hippocampus can be correlated with the severity of cognitive disturbance in AD
It has been reported that levels of ChAT decrease in Alzheimer's patients with severe cognitive impairment and the same has been observed in ICV-STZ-induced cognitive impairment
Likewise, in the present study, in the STZ group, there was reduced ChAT expression.
SA normalized the ChAT expression and mitigated the cognitive impairment in rats.
Similar effects of SA have been reported, where its derivative sinapine restored the levels of acetylcholine and improved learning and memory
Furthermore, studies have revealed that ICV-STZ administration has been associated with neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus
We found that apart from improvements in behavioral parameters, oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory cytokines and hippocampal ChAT expression, SA treatment was accompanied by attenuation of STZ-induced neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
Although in the future, in-depth mechanistic studies about the role of SA-induced neuro-protection are needed, our results show a role of SA in the attenuation of STZ-induced cognitive impairment in rats.

Conclusions
In the present study, our findings showed that ICV-STZ-induced impairment of behavioral parameters; increased oxidative stress and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines were reversed by SA treatment for 21 days.
Free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities of SA may be attributed to these effects.
SA attenuated the cognitive impairment by restoring the acetylcholine levels through up-regulation of ChAT protein expression.
AD being a multifactorial disease, SA can target multiple mechanistic pathways of AD such as oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation and cholinergic dysfunction.
These results thus indicate a therapeutic potential of SA in AD.
