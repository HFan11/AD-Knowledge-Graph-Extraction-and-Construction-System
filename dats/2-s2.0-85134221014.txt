Association of Rare <i>APOE</i> Missense Variants V236E and R251G With Risk of Alzheimer Disease
The APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 alleles are the strongest protective and risk-increasing, respectively, genetic variants for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD).
However, the mechanisms linking APOE to AD-particularly the apoE protein's role in AD pathogenesis and how this is affected by APOE variants-remain poorly understood.
Identifying missense variants in addition to APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 could provide critical new insights, but given the low frequency of additional missense variants, AD genetic cohorts have previously been too small to interrogate this question robustly.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether rare missense variants on APOE are associated with AD risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Association with case-control status was tested in a sequenced discovery sample (stage 1) and followed up in several microarray imputed cohorts as well as the UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing resource using a proxy-AD phenotype (stages 2 and 3).
This study combined case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts that recruited referred and volunteer participants.
Stage 1 included 37 409 nonunique participants of European or admixed European ancestry, with 11 868 individuals with AD and 11 934 controls passing analysis inclusion criteria.
In stages 2 and 3, 475 473 participants were considered across 8 cohorts, of which 84 513 individuals with AD and proxy-AD and 328 372 controls passed inclusion criteria.
Selection criteria were cohort specific, and this study was performed a posteriori on individuals who were genotyped.
Among the available genotypes, 76 195 were excluded.
All data were retrieved between September 2015 and November 2021 and analyzed between April and November 2021.
In primary analyses, the AD risk associated with each missense variant was estimated, as appropriate, with either linear mixed-model regression or logistic regression.
In secondary analyses, associations were estimated with age at onset using linear mixed-model regression and risk of conversion to AD using competing-risk regression.
RESULTS A total of 544 384 participants were analyzed in the primary case-control analysis; 312 476 (57.4%) were female, and the mean (SD; range) age was 64.9 (15.2; 40-110) years.
Two missense variants were associated with a 2-fold to 3-fold decreased AD risk: APOE ε4 (R251G) (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.59;
P = 4.7 × 10 -8 ) and APOE ε3 (V236E) (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.56;
P = 1.9 × 10 -6 ).
Additionally, the cumulative incidence of AD in carriers of these variants was found to grow more slowly with age compared with noncarriers.
In this genetic association study, a novel variant associated with AD was identified: R251G always coinherited with ε4 on the APOE gene, which mitigates the ε4-associated AD risk.
The protective effect of the V236E variant, which is always coinherited with ε3 on the APOE gene, was also confirmed.
The location of these variants confirms that the carboxyl-terminal portion of apoE plays an important role in AD pathogenesis.
The large risk reductions reported here suggest that protein chemistry and functional assays of these variants should be pursued, as they have the potential to guide drug development targeting APOE.
L ate-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is a highly polygenic neurodegenerative disorder with, to date, 75 risk loci associated with AD risk.
It is estimated that 25% of the genetic variance of AD can be attributed to APOE ε2 and APOE ε4.
Human studies have shown that ε4 speeds and ε2 slows the age-related misprocessing of β-amyloid, although how this occurs at the molecular level remains uncertain.
Even the most basic question, does ε4 act via a loss-of-function or gain-offunction mechanism, remains a point of contention.
Lossof-function variants on APOE are exceedingly rare, and the sole case report describing a compound heterozygote with 2 loss-of-function variants involved a patient who was too young to be informative.
The study of additional missense variants on APOE may also help to answer this critical question and further elucidate the role of APOE in AD.
In addition to ε2 and ε4, the only common missense variant (with a minor allele frequency [MAF] greater than 1%) is Arg145Cys (R145C), an African-ancestry variant always found coinherited with APOE ε3, which we have shown increases risk for AD.
Finally, strong functional evidence has been marshalled recently to support a protective role for the Val236Glu (V236E) variant, although this was based on data from an earlier case-control study with only approximately 9000 participants,
On this background, we aimed to investigate, at large scale, the association of rare missense variants on APOE with AD risk.
We used the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data as our discovery sample (stage 1) and sought to replicate significant variants (stages 2 and 3) in multiple cohorts using microarray data imputed on the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) reference panel (National Institutes of Health),
After filtering, 3 variants, Leu28Pro (L28P), Val236Glu (V236E), and Arg251Gly (R251G), were tested for their association with AD risk after adjusting for ε2 and ε4 dosages.
In complementary analyses, we assessed these associations in an APOE-stratified approach to account for the complete linkage disequilibrium of these variants with either the ε2, ε3, or ε4 allele.
In secondary analyses, combining stage 1 and 2 data sets, we tested their association with age at onset in individuals with AD and with risk of conversion to AD using competing-risk regression.

Methods

Participants and Sources of Data
Participants or their caregivers provided written informed consent in the original studies.
The current study protocol was granted an exemption by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board because the analyses were carried out on deidentified, off-the-shelf data; therefore, additional informed consent was not required.
For stage 1 and stage 2, phenotypic information and genotypes were obtained from publicly released genome-wide association study data sets assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and derived from WES and WGS data generated by the ADSP, with phenotype and genotype ascertainment described elsewhere.
7]
Briefly, these included European Alzheimer's Disease DNA Biobank (EADB) core, European Alzheimer's Disease Initiative (EADI), Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (GERAD), Norwegian Dementia Genetics Network (Dem-Gene), and Genome Research at Fundació Alzheimer Center Barcelona (GR@ACE)/Dementia Genetics Spanish Consortium (DEGESCO) cohorts for which phenotype, genotype quality control, and imputation have already been described in Bellenguez et al 1 ; and the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) and the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) APOE sequencing and genotyping were described in Rasmussen et al.
This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Genetic Association Studies (STREGA) reporting guideline.
UK Biobank WES data were analyzed under Application Number 45420.
PLINK version 1.9. 21
gnomAD
The latter are defined as SNVs for which the probe may have variable affinity owing to the presence of other SNV(s) within 20 base pairs and with MAF greater than 1%.
Individuals with more than 5% genotype missingness were excluded.
Duplicate individuals were identified with KING (Kinship-based Inference for GWAS)
Duplicate entries with irreconcilable phenotype or discordant sex were flagged for exclusion.
For individuals with duplicated genotype in sequencing and imputed data, the sequencing entry was used in the stage 1 discovery set and the imputed entry was not included in the stage 2 replication set.
To apply the PC-AiR and PC-Relate methods, we simply considered the intersection of the variants passing quality control in both ADSP WES and ADSP WGS in the discovery set and similarly the intersection of the variants across cohorts genotyping platform in the replication set.

Ancestry Determination
For each cohort, we first determined the ancestry of each individual with SNPWeights version 2 (Harvard)
By applying an ancestry percentage cutoff greater than 75%, the samples were stratified into 5 super populations: South Asian, East Asian, United States, African, and European individuals and an admixed group composed of individuals not passing the 75% cutoff in any single ancestry (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
Since the APOE missense variants of interest L28P, V236E, and R251G are too rare to assess reliably in non-European ancestry populations (eTable 4 in Supplement 1), we restricted our analysis to European and admixed European individuals.
Admixed European individuals were also included in the main analysis and were part of the admixed group defined above and had at least 15% European ancestry.
We performed sensitivity analyses in increments of 30%, including admixed European individuals at 45% and 75% cutoffs.
The latter corresponding to the super population threshold.

Imputation
Each cohort genotyping platform was imputed on the TOPMed imputation server per ancestry group to obtain an imputation quality (R 2 ) per ancestry group.
We retained cohorts with R 2 greater than 0.70 at rs199768005 for the V236E analyses and at rs267606661 for the R251G analyses.
As there was no significant association signal for rs769452 (L28P) in the stage 1 primary analysis, we did not check its imputation quality in stage 2 samples.

APOE Genotype Ascertainment
We directed specific attention to the genotyping of the SNVs determining the main APOE genotype (rs429358 and rs7412), rs769452-C (APOE [L28P]), rs199768005-A (APOE [V236E]), and rs267606661-G (APOE [R251G]) and followed the procedure described in Le Guen et al.

Samples Analyzed
Our discovery sample (stage 1) was composed of individuals of European and admixed European ancestry from the ADSP WES and WGS, corresponding to 11 868 individuals with AD and 11 934 cognitively normal controls (Table
eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 provides a flowchart of the filtering steps leading to the inclusion of these individuals and describes how these data sets were combined.
To build a replication sample (stage 2) for V236E and R251G, we queried for individuals of European and admixed European ancestry in all the publicly available microarray genetic data sets that we had access to at the time of the study in July 2021 (Table
These data sets are largely part of the ADGC, and as such, this replication will be referred to hereafter as the ADGC replication in stage 2.
After quality control and duplicate removal, 7768 individuals with AD and 8059 controls remained in the ADGC replication sample.
eTable 5 in Supplement 1 presents the demographic characteristics of the remaining individuals with AD and cognitively unimpaired controls.
In stage 3, we pursued additional replication in external data sets (not publicly available) and in the UK Biobank WES using the proxy-AD phenotype (Table
Overall, the external replications included 36 393 individuals with AD and 150 943 controls, and the UK Biobank replication included 28 484 individuals with proxy-AD and 157 436 controls.

Study Design and Statistical Analysis
In our analysis, we only considered missense variants with a minor allele count greater than 10 in any APOE main genotype groups in our next-generation sequencing discovery (stage 1) to avoid outlier-confounded effect size estimates.
Three APOE missense variants were retained for further analyses: L28P, V236E, and R251G (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
The V236E variant is always coinherited with APOE ε3, and the L28P and R251G are always coinherited with APOE ε4 (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).
Two variants are coinherited when they are on the same chromosome copy and close enough to each other that a meiotic crossover event never occurs between them.
We thus developed 2 complementary approaches to take into account these linkage disequilibrium structures.
In primary analyses, we estimated the AD risk associated with L28P, V236E, and R251G on case-control diagnoses using linear mixed-model regression (stages 1 and 2 and UK Biobank) and logistic regression model (stage 3), adjusted for ε2 and ε4 dosages, in addition to the covariates described below for all analyses.
The adjustment by the common ε3 and ε4 APOE alleles is necessary because the rare variants tested here are always coinherited with either the ε3 or ε4 APOE allele.
In complementary analyses, we also estimated the AD risk associated with V236E and R251G stratified by their associated common APOE allele genotype.
V236E was assessed in APOE ε3/ε3 and R251G was assessed in the APOE ε3/ε4 stratum.
An association was considered significant in stage 1 if it reached a Bonferronicorrected P value threshold of .017
(.05/3) in the model adjusted for ε2 and ε4 dosages; all P values were 2-tailed.
L28P was not associated with AD risk in this model and was not studied further.
Sample sizes and demographic characteristics for the stratified analyses are shown in eTable 5 in Supplement 1.
In sensitivity analyses, we estimated AD risk associations for different European ancestry inclusion thresholds.
In secondary analyses, combining stages 1 and 2 data sets, we estimated the influence of significant stage 1 variants on age at onset in AD cases using linear mixed-model regression and risk of conversion to AD using competing-risk regression.
In secondary analyses, associations were considered significant when passing the nominal P value threshold of .05.
The case-control and age-at-onset analyses used linear mixed-model regression available through the GENESIS package version 3.12.
Multivariate competing-risk regression and cumulative incidence estimation were implemented using the cmprsk package version 2.2.
In this time-to-event analysis, failure events were defined as age at onset for individuals who developed AD (conversion to AD) and age at death for controls.
Controls without reported death were right-censored at age at last visit.
Left censoring was set at age 50 years, and younger individuals were excluded from the analysis.
All statistical analyses were adjusted for sex and 4 genetic principal components estimated with the PC-AiR method 31 implemented in GENESIS.
Linear mixed-model analyses were additionally covaried by a sparse genetic association matrix estimated with the PC-Relate method
Case-control analyses were not adjusted for age given that correcting for age when individuals with AD are younger than controls leads to the model incorrectly inferring the age effect on AD risk, resulting in statistical power loss.
ase-control analyses in stage 3, external replication cohorts and proxy-AD phenotype in UK Biobank, were implemented to be consistent with the stage 1 primary analyses.
Exact model/analysis details are described in the eMethods in Supplement 1.
For the ADSP/ADGC cohorts, all statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0.2
(The R Foundation).
All meta-analyses were implemented with a fixed-effect inverse variance-weighted design implemented in the metafor R package version 3.0.2.

Results
A total of 544 384 participants were analyzed in the primary case-control analysis; 312 476 (57.4%) were female, and the mean (SD; range) age was 64.9 (15.2; 40-110) years.
In stage 1 primary analyses, V236E (rs199768005-A) and R251G (rs267606661-G) were associated with a 4-fold to 5-fold decreased AD risk in nonstratified analyses adjusted for ε2 and ε4 dosages (V236E: odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.56;
P = .001;
R251G: OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49;
P = 3.7 × 10 -4 ) (Figure
Similarly, in APOEstratified analyses, V236E was associated with a 3-fold decreased AD risk in individuals with ε3/ε3 (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.82;
P = .02),
and R251G was associated with a 5-fold decreased AD risk in individuals with ε3/ε4 (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.48;
P = 7.8 × 10 -4 ) (Table
The L28P variant (rs769452-C) was not associated with AD risk in the nonstratified analyses (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.77-1.62;
P = .56).
As such, it was not investigated further.
In stages 2 and 3, across multiple replication cohorts, the effects of V236E and R251G in nonstratified analyses were concordant and both were significantly associated with AD risk (V236E: OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27-0.66;
P = 2.0 × 10 -4 ; R251G: OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.66;
P = 5.8 × 10 -6 ).
The overall metaanalysis (Figure
P = 1.9 × 10 -6 ; R251G: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.59;
P = 4.7 × 10 -8 ).
Similar results were obtained in APOE-stratified meta-analyses (Table
We further estimated the odds per APOE genotype group, using individuals with ε3/ε3 who did not carry V236E as the reference (ie, OR of individuals with APOE ε3/ε3 equals 1), by meta-analyzing the ADSP discovery and ADGC replication cohorts.
Compared with the reference ε3/ε3 group, the ε3/ε3 (V236E) and ε3/ε4 (R251G) groups had AD risk lower than or similar to the ε2/ε3 group (Figure
Results of sensitivity analyses evaluating different European ancestry cutoffs are shown in eTable 8 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1.
Briefly, the results remained unchanged when selecting individuals with admixed ancestry with at least 45% European ancestry or when restricting the analysis to individuals with European ancestry (75% cutoff).
We note that the ORs in the combined ADSP/ADGC data sets for V236E and R251G remain unchanged at different ancestry cutoffs.
For example, using an ancestry cutoff at 75%, the nonstratified metaanalysis yielded an OR of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12-0.58;
P = 8.6 × 10 -4 ) for V236E compared with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.12-0.56;
P = 5.4 × 10 -4 ) using a cutoff of 15%.
Similar observations were made for the R251G variant.
As additional supplementary analyses, we assessed the effect of the inclusion of all dementia (rather than AD specifically) in the CCHS and CGPS data set, and we estimated the significance without including UK Biobank.
Overall, the significance of the results slightly improved when including a broader dementia category (R251G: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.59;
P = 3.5 × 10 -8 ) (eTable 9 in Supplement 1).
While removing UK Biobank proxy-AD phenotype samples reduced the significance of our results slightly, the ORs became slightly more protective (R251G: OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.27-0.56;
P = 1.2 × 10 -7 ) (eTable 10 in Supplement 1).
In secondary analyses, including data from stages 1 and 2, we considered the meta-analysis of ADSP/ADGC samples (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).
In non-APOE stratified analyses adjusted for ε2 and ε4 dosages (eTable 7 in Supplement 1), V236E carriers had a mean age at AD onset 10.5 years older than non-carriers (β = 10.64;
95% CI, 1.78-19.49;
P = .02)
and slower incidence with age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.76;
P = .01).
While R251G's association with age at onset was not significant (β = 0.97; 95% CI, -2.96 to 4.91; P = .63),
its association with reduced AD incidence with age was just nominally significant (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97;
P = .04).
In APOE-stratified analyses (eTable 7 in Supplement 1), a similar association of V236E with age at AD onset was observed in individuals with ε3/ε3 (β = 10.93;
95% CI, 1.06-20.81;
P = .03).
R251G carriers had a mean age at AD onset 6 years older than noncarriers of ε3/ε4, but this association was not significant (β = 6.04; 95% CI, -0.71 to 12.79; P = .08).
The competing risk results emphasized that the cumulative incidence of AD in participants with ε3/ε3 grows slower with age in individuals carrying the V236E variant (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.97;
P = .04)
and similarly in participants with ε3/ε4 carrying the R251G variant (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.54;
P = 2.9 × 10 -4 ).

Discussion
We have shown that 2 missense variants V236E and R251G are each associated with a more than 2-fold reduction in AD risk (Figure
These variants have an allele frequency of less than 0.1% in gnomAD version 3.1, even when restricting this frequency estimate to individuals of European ancestry (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
Because of their rarity and linkage disequilibrium with the common APOE ε3 and ε4 alleles, they have not been identified in prior genome-wide association studies.
To our knowledge, the association of R251G with AD risk has not been previously reported.
This variant, carried on the same haplotype as ε4, is the first APOE variant found to mitigate the AD risk attributable to the ε4 isoform of the apoE protein.
Notably, having R251G in association with APOE ε4 results in a risk estimate similar to APOE ε2, as shown in Figure
Regarding potential mechanisms driving these associations, it is notable that these 2 variants are on apoE's C-terminal domain.
The common APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 alleles are located on the N-terminal domain of the protein near the receptor-binding region.
Their outsized role in AD risk has, understandably, focused attention on the N-terminal domain and the differential capacity of these alleles to, for example, bind apoE's receptors.
The current results add support to studies suggesting that the C-terminal domain is also of critical importance for AD pathogenesis.

Notably, the authors showed reduced levels of insoluble β-amyloid and apoE aggregates in the brain of V236E carriers compared with noncarriers.
In 5×FAD mice, they observed that APOE ε3 (V236E) reduced Aβ deposition, plaque-associated immune response, and neuritic dystrophy around amyloid plaques.
Chemically, they noted that APOE ε3 (V236E) primarily remains as a monomer and is less likely to form oligomers compared with the canonical APOE ε3 allele.
This propensity of V236E to reduce apoE aggregation was also observed when this variant was introduced on an APOE ε4 allele.
It is worth noting, however, that V236E also appears to increase dimerization (see Figure
]
The switch from a charged arginine amino acid to a nonpolar glycine might, however, be expected to increase rather than decrease oligomerization.
Changes in this region could also enhance apoE ε4's ability to bind lipids rendering it more like ε3 or ε2 in this capacity.
Alternatively, the introduction of glycine could disrupt the α helix structure of the C-terminal impacting apoE ε4's hypothesized N-terminal-C-terminal domain interaction.
In any case, pending protein chemistry experiments exploring potential structural and functional changes, the mechanism underlying the substantial protective effect of R251G remains to be elucidated.

Limitations
Our study has several limitations.
The V236E association was not genome-wide significant.
We included the UK Biobank data set that does not include a direct clinical diagnosis of AD.
Because of the paucity of variant carriers of non-European ancestries, we did not assess these variants in other ancestries (although they can be found in African American individuals and admixed Latino individuals based on gnomAD estimates; eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
These caveats point to the need for further confirmation of these variants as available AD data sets grow and become more ancestrally diverse.

Conclusions
Our work was performed on, to our knowledge, the largest available sample to date for APOE ε3 (V236E) and APOE ε4 (R251G).
These findings validate the protective effect of the V236E variant and has uncovered a novel protective missense variant on APOE ε4.
Each variant had a substantial association with reducing the risk of AD.
While some compelling functional data suggest that V236E confers protection by reducing oligomerization of apoE, there are alternative mechanisms that merit consideration (increasing dimerization, for one).
The protective mechanism of R251G remains unexplored, but finding a single amino acid substitution that renders the APOE -ε4 allele protective supports the idea that APOE ε4-specific treatments are worth exploring.
We anticipate that the findings reported here will spark additional mechanistic work on apoE's role in AD pathogenesis.
