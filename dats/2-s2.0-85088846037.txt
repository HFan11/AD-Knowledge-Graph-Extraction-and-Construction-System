Protective Role of Cerebrospinal Fluid Inflammatory Cytokines in Patients with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early Alzheimer’s Disease Carrying Apolipoprotein E4 Genotype
Background: Neuroinflammatory cytokines can play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributing to the evolution of degenerative processes.
We aimed at evaluating the levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in subjects with diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild AD.
We evaluated CSF contents of inflammatory cytokines in 66 patients divided according to the NIA-AA research framework and the APOE genotype.
CSF of a group of cognitively unimpaired individuals (n = 23) was evaluated as control.
All patients were evaluated for 24 months using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
We found significant increased levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and G-CSF in the CSF of A+/T-APOE4 carriers, respect to A+/T-patients homozygous for APOE3, respect to A+/T+ patients, regardless the APOE status, and respect to controls.
Over a period of 24 months, A+/T-APOE4 carriers, with increased levels of cytokines, showed a preserved cognitive evaluation when compared to the other subgroups of patients (delta MMSE at 24 months respect to baseline: 0.10 ± 0.35; p < 0.05).
Our data suggest that during early phases of AD, in APOE4 carriers, A␤ pathology likely induces a specific cytokines pattern synthesis associated to cognitive preservation.
These data highlight the different role that neuroinflammation can play in AD pathology based on the presence of specific CSF biomarkers and on the APOE status.

In last decades, neuropathological analysis protein, part of the neuronal cytoskeleton, is necessary for axonal physiology, for neurite outgrowth, neural plasticity mechanisms, repair of neurons after injuries
Impaired metabolism of tau protein has been demonstrated to rapidly induce impairment of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, all mechanisms responsible for cognitive decline in AD patients
However, a clear relationship between tau pathology and neuroinflammation is still unclear.
We recently showed that human astrocytes cultures incubated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD patients were vulnerable in terms of increased apoptosis only in the presence of high levels of tau protein and APOE4 genotype
Such findings led us to hypothesize a major role for tau protein in astrocytes degeneration and likely a proinflammatory role for tau in APOE4 individuals
Interestingly, it has been reported that APOE4 carriers present an unbalanced switching of the microglial phenotype M1-M2   p < 0.001) (see Table
In particular, in the multiple comparisons analyses, we found that G-CSF and IL-4 levels were significantly higher in the (A+/T-) E4 group (p < 0.05 for all comparisons) (Fig.
Similarly, we found significant higher levels of IL-6
and IL-8 in the CSF of (A+/T-) E4 group respect to (A+/T-) E3 group, (A+/T+) E4 group, and controls (p < 0.05 for all comparisons), as well as a strong tendency compared to the (A+/T+) E3 group (p = 0.06 for IL-6, p = 0.09 for IL-8) (Fig.

Through its interaction with excitatory pathways, IL-6 can participate to the clearance of A␤ peptides
IL-4 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory activity, influencing astrocytes in the synthesis of neurotrophic growth factors
Moreover, in experimental settings, IL-4 has been shown to promote microglial clearance of A␤ oligomers
IL-8 is a chemokine that protects neurons by both paracrine or autocrine loop
In cases of A␤ pathology, IL-8 is able to inhibit A␤-induced apoptosis and promotes synthesis and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protecting neuronal survival
G-CSF is a growth factor involved in stimulation and maturation of blood cells.
Besides that, G-CSF plays a key role in neurogenesis and differentiation during brain development and a direct influence on synaptic plasticity
G-CSF can also influence neuronal activity through its receptors expressed in hippocampus and frontal cortices
In this view, it is likely to suppose that ApoE4



INTRODUCTION 31 Alzheimer
's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, 32 chronic neurodegenerative disorder, which main 33 pathological features are the extracellular senile 34 plaques and the intraneuronal neurofibrillary tan-35



[
18].
Moreover, microglial ApoE downstream regulates the microglial homeostatic gene expression, leading to a neurodegenerative-associated phenotype switch, which could further promote AD pathology [19].
Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the levels of 15 cytokines in the CSF of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and mild AD, according to the hallmarks processes of amyloid deposition, tau pathology, and APOE genotype.
To reduce possible discrepancies between clinical presentation and CSF biomarkers profile, patients were divided using the NIA-AA research framework [20].
The AT(N) classification divides biomarkers into amyloid deposits (A), neurofibrillary tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N), determined by measuring CSF levels of A␤ 42 , phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau), respectively.
Although biomarkers of neurodegeneration (N) provide important pathologic staging information they are not specific for neurodegeneration due to AD; for this reason, A and T biomarkers are commonly used to discriminate patients in the AD continuum, subdivided into AD pathologic change (A+/T-) and AD (A+/T+).
Because of the evidence of modulation of ApoE isoforms in neuroinflammation [17-19] and the effect of neuroinflammation on the neurodegenerative processes in several types of dementia [21], we expect to find a different profile of neuroinflammatory cytokines in patients classified by AT and U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f APOE genotype.
Furthermore, we expect to find different rate of disease progression among groups, thus patients were evaluated with neuropsychological testing for a period of two years.
METHODS Subjects Sixty-six consecutive patients (range, 58-79 years; median, 71) were recruited at the memory clinic of the University Hospital Tor Vergata, admitted for complaining memory symptoms.
The diagnosis of probable or possible AD fulfilled the criteria of the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA/AA) [22] and all patients had a mild disease with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging 20-24.
The aMCI patients were diagnosed using the NIA/AA criteria for MCI [23].
All patients underwent, for diagnostic purposes, a complete clinical investigation in a period not superior to 60 days, including medical history, neurological examination, MMSE, a complete blood screening, and neuropsychological assessment [24] including the following cognitive domains: general cognitive efficiency: MMSE; verbal episodic memory: Rey auditory verbal long-term memory (15-Word List Immediate and 15 min Delayed recall); visuospatial abilities and visuospatial episodic memory: Complex Rey's Figure (copy and 10 min Delayed recall); and executive functions: phonological word fluency; analogic reasoning: Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices.
Patients underwent also a neuropsychiatric evaluation, magnetic resonance or computed tomography (CT) imaging, positron emission tomography/CT, and lumbar puncture for CSF analysis.
Exclusion criteria were: cognitive isolated deficits, clinically manifest acute stroke in the last 6 months showing a Hachinski scale score >4, and a radiological evidence of ischemic lesions, A␤ 1-42 CSF values >600 pg/mL.
All patients started treatment with rivastigmine patch or donepezil and were followed longitudinally with clinical assessments and MMSE testing at 6, 12, and 18 months.
Control patients (n = 23) were evaluated for headache in the Policlinico Tor Vergata Hospital Emergency Department between October 2014 and December 2015, and the CSF samples were collected in accordance with standard hospital practice.
The control subjects did not carry a diagnosis of active infection and were free of cognitive and primary neurological disorders other than headache.
All participants or their legal guardian provided 183 written informed consent after receiving an extensive 184 description of the study.
The study was performed 185 according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
The ethics 186 committee of the Santa Lucia Foundation approved 187 this protocol (Prot.
CE/AG4/PROG.392-08).
188 Biomarkers collection and genotype analysis 189 The first 12 mL of CSF were collected in a 190 polypropylene tube and directly transported to the 191 local laboratory for centrifugation at 2000 g at +4 • C 192 for 10 min.
The supernatant was pipetted off, mixed 193 to avoid potential gradient effects and aliquoted 194 in 1 mL portions in polypropylene tubes, stored 195 at -80 • C pending biochemical analyses.
CSF t-tau 196 and p-tau phosphorylated at Thr181 concentrations 197 were determined using a sandwich enzyme-linked 198 immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Innotest hTAU-Ag; 199 Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium).
A␤ 1-42 levels were 200 determined using a sandwich ELISA (Innotest ␤-201 amyloid; Innogenetics) [25].
Genotyping for APOE 202 were performed by allelic discrimination technology 203 (TaqMan; Applied Biosystems).
204 CSF cytokines and chemokines determination 205 In a group of 89 individuals CSF contents of 206 cytokines and chemokines were determined.
These 207 include IL-1␤, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-208 10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 209 (TNF␣); granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-210 CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 211 factor (GM-CSF); macrophage inflammatory pro-212 teins (MIP)-1a and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 213 (MCP-1).
To determine cytokines and chemokines, 214 the CSF was centrifuged and immediately stored 215 at -80 • C until analyzed using Bio-Plex Multiplex 216 Cytokine Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, 217 CA), according to manufacturer's instructions.
Con-218 centration of analytes were calculated according 219 to a standard curve and expressed as picograms 220 per milliliter.
When the concentrations of the ana-221 lytes were below the detection threshold, they were 222 assumed to be 0 pg/ml; a maximum of values below considered acceptable for the analysis.225
Statistical analysis 226 Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation 227 (SD).
Differences among groups were compared


cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors according to NIA-AA research framework and APOE genotype In this experimental setting cytokines, chemokines and growth factor's levels (IL-1␤, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, TNF␣; G-CSF, GM-CSF; MIP-1 and MCP-1) were determined in CSF samples of each group of patients and controls.
Results showed that differences among groups reached statistical significance only for G-CSF (F = 6.463; p < 0.001), IL-4 (F = 4.059; p = 0.004), IL-6 (F = 4.481; p = 002), and IL-8 (F = 5.296;

associated with the neurodegenerative processes of dementias.
Intriguingly, these conflicting findings, as well our results, do nothing but reinforce the concept of neuroinflammation as a dynamic process that can act differently as a protective or harmful mechanism depending on the stage of disease and the genetic substrate (e.g., APOE).
Our study has some limitation, first of all the small sample size.
Larger samples of patients and controls are needed to detect other significant difference in cytokines levels.
Nevertheless, our study has the merit to measure cytokine's contents directly in the CSF of patients which have a robust diagnosis of AD pathology, supported by CSF biomarkers (A␤, tau, p-tau), and long clinical follow-up periods.
In summary, although several studies suggest the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines production as a therapeutic target in AD [45, 46], the present work suggests that caution must be taken on modulate neuroinflammatory signaling to ensure that protective pathways are not compromised.
Future studies are needed to disentangle the intricate role of neuroinflammation in AD to provide valuable cues for the development of more selective therapeutic strategies.
