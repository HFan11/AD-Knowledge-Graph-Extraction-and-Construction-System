Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid β (Aβ) interact with cell adhesion molecules: Implications in Alzheimer’s disease and normal physiology
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which dysfunction and loss of synapses and neurons lead to cognitive impairment and death.
Accumulation and aggregation of neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides generated via amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is considered to play a central role in the disease etiology.
APP interacts with cell adhesion molecules, which influence the normal physiological functions of APP, its amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing, and formation of Aβ aggregates.
These cell surface glycoproteins also mediate attachment of Aβ to the neuronal cell surface and induce intracellular signaling contributing to Aβ toxicity.
In this review, we discuss the current knowledge surrounding the interactions of cell adhesion molecules with APP and Aβ and analyze the evidence of the critical role these proteins play in regulating the processing and physiological function of APP as well as Aβ toxicity.
This is a necessary piece of the complex AD puzzle, which we should understand in order to develop safe and effective therapeutic interventions for AD.

Introduction Alzheimer's disease and the amyloid hypothesis
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which progressive synapse loss and neuronal dysfunction are followed by neuronal death in the brain.
People with AD suffer from severe cognitive impairments and eventually die as a result of the disease.
AD is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States
Its global economic burden, together with other dementias, is estimated to be nearly $1 trillion (USD) per annum
Despite decades of research, effective therapeutic interventions for AD remain elusive, presenting a considerable problem given the increasingly aging population of our world today.
The amyloid hypothesis has been central to our understanding of AD for the past three decades.
It proposes that aggregates of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the primary component of senile plaques formed in brains of people with AD, are the main causative agents in AD pathogenesis
These Aβ aggregates bind to cell surface receptors on neurons and glial cells, inducing synaptic dysfunction and neuroinflammation, triggering aberrant intracellular signaling cascades that lead to hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau, causing disruption of axonal transport, oxidative damage, breakdown of homeostasis, and resulting in neurotoxicity
The gradual loss of synapses and neurons is responsible for cognitive impairment, memory loss, and, eventually, death.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its processing
Aβ peptides are generated via the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
APP is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a large N-terminal extracellular domain, transmembrane region, and short intracellular tail (Figure
APP is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 21, and alternative splicing generates three main isoforms, APP695, APP751, and APP770, denoted by their amino acid length.
The extracellular part of all isoforms is comprised of two rigidly folded domains, E1 and E2, joined by a flexible acidic domain (AcD) and connected to the transmembrane region by a mostly unstructured juxtamembrane linker
(A) APP is composed of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, transmembrane region, and short cytoplasmic tail.
The extracellular domain comprises two rigidly folded regions, E1 and E2, joined by an acidic domain (AcD).
E1 contains a heparin-binding domain (HBD) within a larger growth factor-like domain (GFLD), and a copper/zinc-binding domain (CuBD).
E2 comprises the second HBD and CuBD.
The juxtamembrane region contains the αand β-cleavage sites, while the γ-cleavage site is located within the transmembrane domain.
The C-terminal intracellular domain (AICD) contains the YENPTY sequence, which binds cytosolic adaptor proteins.
(B) APP is primarily processed along two opposing pathways.
In amyloidogenic processing, APP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE1) at the N-terminus of Aβ, generating sAPPβ and the membrane-bound β-CTF.
Subsequent γ-secretase cleavage of β-CTF releases the Aβ peptide into the extracellular/lumenal space and AICD into the cytosol.
Aβ peptides aggregate and form oligomers (AβO).
In non-amyloidogenic processing, APP is cleaved by α-secretase (ADAM10) within the Aβ region, producing sAPPα and α-CTF.
Ensuing cleavage of α-CTF by γ-secretase liberates P3 into the extracellular/lumenal space and AICD into the cytosol.
(Figure
E1 contains a heparin-binding domain (HBD) within a larger growth factor-like domain (GFLD), as well as a copper/zincbinding domain (CuBD).
E2 contains the second HBD and CuBD
The extracellular domain mediates homophilic trans-interactions, where an APP molecule on one cell binds to an APP molecule on an adjacent cell, allowing APP to function as a cell adhesion molecule
The extracellular domain also binds other ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)
The single-pass transmembrane domain is involved in cholesterol binding
The Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain is present in the two longer isoforms, APP751 and APP770, and the OX-2 sequence is contained in APP770
APP is widely expressed in many tissues.
APP695 is the major neuronal isoform, while APP751 and APP770 are highly expressed in nonneuronal cells (Rohan de
APP undergoes complex proteolytic processing, yielding a number of biologically active fragments.
Processing along the amyloidogenic pathway is initiated by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which cleaves APP at the amino terminus of the Aβ region, producing sAPPβ and the membrane-bound β-C-terminal fragment, β-CTF
In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, α-secretase (ADAM10; a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) cleaves APP between Lys 16 and Leu 17 of the Aβ region, preventing the formation of Aβ and releasing sAPPα and α-CTF instead
The cell surface or trans-Golgi network accumulation of APP favors non-amyloidogenic processing
In both pathways, γ-secretase, a complex composed of presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2), cleaves the membrane-tethered CTFs yielding Aβ from β-CTF and P3 from α-CTF, as well as the APP intracellular domain (AICD) (Figure
In the amyloidogenic pathway, γ-secretase produces peptides of varying length with Aβ 40 , denoted by amino acid length, being most abundant and Aβ 42 being most aggregation prone
A shift towards the generation of Aβ 42 over Aβ 40 , or an imbalance in the overall production and clearance of Aβ peptides predisposes to the formation of neurotoxic oligomers (AβO), fibrils (AβF) and plaques
In addition, there are several noncanonical pathways through which APP can be processed, including proteolysis by η-secretase, δ-secretase, meprin, and caspases
APP is a member of a small family of proteins consisting of APP and APP-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2)
Although structurally very similar to APP, APLPs lack the Aβ region and are thus non-amyloidogenic.
As a whole, members of the APP family share poorly understood roles in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, learning, and memory
Many therapeutic interventions have targeted Aβ and the proteases responsible for its generation, however thus far, all attempts have failed to demonstrate reasonable efficacy and are associated with worsening cognition and other side effects
These failures can be partly attributed to an incomplete understanding of the complex cell biology underlying: 1) the processing of APP, 2) the normal physiological function of APP and its proteases, and 3) the mechanisms of Aβ-induced toxicity.
A class of proteins intimately involved in these poorly understood processes are cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), a vast category of cell surface proteins that mediate adhesion of cells to one another and to the extracellular matrix (ECM).
These broadly include CAMs of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), integrins, cadherins, selectins, and other uncategorized proteins that possess adhesive function, including APP itself.
CAMs are of particular interest in amyloiddependent AD pathology as their structure and cell surface localization make them well-suited for interactions with both APP and Aβ, many of which have been found to date.
Multiple gene ontological analyses have also described cell adhesion as an affected pathway in AD
Thus, in this review, we summarize the current knowledge surrounding the interactions of CAMs with APP and Aβ and how CAMs influence the processing and physiological function of APP as well as their role in Aβ toxicity.
This breadth of knowledge is a necessary piece of the complex AD puzzle, which we should better understand to enable the development of safe and effective therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of AD.

Interactions of CAMs with APP and the role that CAMs play in the amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ toxicity APP family
As APP family proteins are themselves CAMs, we first discuss the role that homo-and hetero-dimerization of the members of this family plays in APP processing, functioning, and Aβ toxicity.

APP homodimerization influences its processing
APP interacts with itself forming homodimers in the mouse brain
The impact of dimerization on APP processing is complex and remains controversial.
Several reports suggest that APP dimerization modulates the balance between its αand β-cleavage.
For example, inhibition of APP dimerization using an APP-E1-derived peptide leads to an increase in sAPPα levels and reduction in sAPPβ and Aβ levels in SH-SY5Y cells
Similarly, small molecule inhibitors of APP dimerization reduce sAPPβ and Aβ levels in HEK293 cells without affecting Aβ 42/40 ratio
Together, these findings suggest that APP dimerization promotes BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP.
However, other studies report that APP dimerization in CHO cells leads to an increase in sAPPα levels and decrease in sAPPβ levels
In addition, a number of studies suggest that APP dimerization influences its γ-secretasemediated cleavage.
For example, mutationally induced dimerization of the juxtamembrane region of APP leads to an increase in Aβ levels without affecting sAPPα or sAPPβ levels, suggesting that the γ-secretase cleavage efficiency of APP-CTFs may be influenced by APP dimerization
The preferred γ-cleavage site within APP may also be affected by the mode of dimerization, as copper-induced APP dimerization via the CuBD of E1 favors production of Aβ 40 over Aβ 42 while TMD dimerization promotes generation of Aβ 42 over Aβ 40
It has also been suggested that juxtamembrane domain/TMD dimerization may predispose Aβ to form dimers and oligomers, which may in turn affect the levels and toxicity of Aβ
A possible explanation for these controversies may lie in the fact that various regions of APP contribute to dimerization, and it is quite probable that variations in the contact sites involved may influence APP processing in different ways.

Interactions of APP with other APP family proteins influence APP processing
APP interacts with APLP1 in the mouse brain
This interaction is mediated partially by the E1 domains of APP and APLP1 (Figure
While APP is mostly found intracellularly, APLP1, in contrast, is predominantly localized at the cell surface and has a much slower rate of endocytosis compared to APP
Accordingly, APP-APLP1 interactions are reported to suppress endocytosis of APP, increasing its α-cleavage and reducing its β-cleavage in HEK293 cells
In agreement, the co-expression of APP and APLP1 in SH-SY5Y cells results in reduced Aβ generation compared to cells transfected with APP only
APP also influences the subcellular distribution of APLP1, reducing its levels at the cell surface
Given the emerging role of APLP1 as the primary cell adhesion molecule of the APP family
In the mouse brain, APP also binds to APLP2 via its GFLD of E1
Similarly to APLP1, APLP2 reduces Aβ generation in HEK293 cells when it is co-    expressed with APP
APLPs preferentially reduce Aβ 42 , rather than Aβ 40 levels, suggesting that APP/APLP interactions affect the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP-CTFs

APP interacts with Aβ and mediates Aβ toxicity
APP interacts with Aβ monomers, oligomers, and fibrils, acting as a receptor for Aβ, which mediates Aβ-induced toxicity (Figure
Soluble Aβ was found to bind to the Aβ region of APP at the cell surface thereby inducing cell death in N2a cells
This effect was dependent on the YENPTY motif in the APP intracellular domain, which interacts with a number of cytoplasmic proteins involved in intracellular signaling, suggesting that Aβ induces intracellular signaling pathways via APP.
Consistent with this idea, AβO treatment of B103 cells increases Ras levels and ERK phosphorylation, both of which are dependent on APP expression
ERK induces hyperphosphorylation of tau and thereby can mediate the APP-dependent AβO toxicity
In APP-/-mice, AβO binding to synapses is reduced and AβO effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) and the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity are attenuated
Cultured APP-/-neurons are less vulnerable to Aβinduced toxicity compared to wild-type neurons
Aβ monomers and dimers also bind to the E1 domain of APP, increasing APP homodimerization and influencing neurotransmitter release probability
In addition, AβFs bind to APP leading to an increase in APP levels at the cell surface, thereby facilitating the binding of Aβ to APP
APP-Aβ interactions promote homodimerization of APP, which may in turn stimulate amyloidogenic processing of APP to a greater extent
APLP1 has also been identified as a binding partner of AβO, however, the functional significance of this interaction remains to be determined (Figure

Immunoglobulin superfamily of CAMs
Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) of CAMs are plasma membrane-attached glycoproteins characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin-like (Ig) repeats within their extracellular domains.
IgSF CAMs mediate calcium-independent homophilic adhesion between cells where identical molecules on membranes of adjacent cells bind to each other.
IgSF CAMs also heterophilically interact in cis with a number of other cell surface receptors located within the same membrane or bind in trans to the cell surface receptors on membranes of other cells.
These proteins play important roles in regulating neuronal development and synaptic functions
The role that APP and Aβ play in regulating the functions of these proteins and effects of these proteins on the amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ toxicity are reviewed below.

Neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs)
NCAMs belong to a sub-family of CAMs within the IgSF.
The group consists of NCAM1 (originally designated NCAM) and the lesser known NCAM2 (also designated OCAM)
NCAM1 and NCAM2 are structurally similar, being composed of five N-terminal Ig domains (IgI-V) and two fibronectin type III (Fn3) repeats (Fn3I-II) (Figure
Alternative splicing generates three major NCAM1 isoforms, which have identical extracellular domains and differ in the membrane attachment.
Two longer isoforms of NCAM1, designated NCAM140 and NCAM180 according to their molecular weight, are transmembrane proteins with a longer intracellular tail in NCAM180.
The shortest NCAM1 isoform, designated NCAM120, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein lacking the intracellular domain.
Two major NCAM2 isoforms also have identical extracellular domains.
The longer NCAM2 isoform is a transmembrane protein, whereas the shorter isoform is GPI-anchored to the plasma membrane.
NCAMs are expressed in many tissues but are particularly enriched in the brain, where they participate in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity

NCAMs interact with APP
NCAM1 forms a complex with APP in the mouse brain, with the E2 domain of APP and the extracellular domain of NCAM1 mediating this interaction (Chen and Dou, 2012) (Figure
NCAM180, a splice variant of NCAM1 with a longer cytoplasmic tail, does not, however, associate with APP, suggesting that the APP/NCAM1 complex formation may also be dependent on an additional intracellular mechanism.
The interaction of APP with NCAM1 is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster, where the APP homolog, APPL, binds to the NCAM ortholog Fasciclin 2
Human APP was also found in a complex with NCAM2 in the brain of transgenic APP23 mice

Role of APP in regulating NCAM1-dependent neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis
APP and NCAM1 trigger the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2.
Coexpression of NCAM1 and APP in COS7 cells promotes phosphorylation of ERK1,2 to a larger extent than found in cells expressing either protein alone
This synergistic effect requires the extracellular, but not the intracellular domain of APP.
Both APP and NCAM1 independently promote neurite outgrowth in mouse hippocampal neurons, and when present together they increase neurite outgrowth synergistically
The fact that the latter effect can be induced by secreted sAPPα is consistent with a non-essential role of the intracellular domain of APP, altogether indicative of a ligand-receptor interaction between APP and NCAM1 (Figure
The role of the interaction between NCAM and APP in synaptogenesis was shown in Drosophila, where Fasciclin 2 promotes synapse formation by interacting with APPL, which initiates signaling via the adaptor protein Mint1

NCAMs in AD
In AD, NCAM1 levels are reduced in the frontal and temporal cortex, while levels of proteolytic NCAM1 fragments in the serum are increased
The levels of NCAM1 carrying polysialic acid, an unusual carbohydrate predominantly found on NCAM1, are similarly diminished in the entorhinal cortex in AD-affected brains inversely correlating with hyperphosphorylated tau load
The levels of polysialylated NCAM1 are however increased in the AD hippocampus
NCAM2 is enriched in the human hippocampus, a brain region highly susceptible to Aβ-induced toxicity.
In brains of people with AD, NCAM2 levels are reduced in hippocampal synapses and the levels of soluble NCAM2 are elevated suggesting increased shedding of NCAM2 from synaptic membranes
The overall levels of NCAM2 and the levels of its phosphorylation are however increased in AD brains
Together these data suggest that NCAMs play a role in AD.

NCAMs regulate the amyloidogenic processing of APP
Co-expression of NCAM1 with APP in CHO cells reduces production of both Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 , suggesting that NCAM1 modulates APP processing (Chen and Dou, 2012) (Figure
The mechanism underlying this effect is currently unknown.
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in NCAM2 (rs2212624) is associated with the development of late-onset AD
The association between SNPs in NCAM2 and the levels of Aβ in CSF

Role of NCAMs in Aβ toxicity
A peptide derived from the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-binding region of NCAM1 within the Fn3II domain prevents neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AβO-treated rats
The peptide mimics NCAM1 functions by binding to and activating FGFR
Together these data suggest that the loss of NCAM1-FGFR interactions and attenuation of NCAM1-dependent signaling contribute to Aβ toxicity.
NCAM2 interacts with AβOs in brains of transgenic APP23 mice, and AβOs increase shedding of synaptic NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons, compromising synaptic adhesion and inducing synapse disassembly

L1 family
The L1 family is a group of IgSF CAMs that includes L1, close homologue of L1 (CHL1), neurofascin and NgCAMrelated CAM (NrCAM).
L1 is a transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail and extracellular domain composed of six Ig-like domains and five Fn3 repeats (Figure
L1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, but is enriched in the nervous system, where it plays a role in synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and neuromuscular junction stability

Role of APP in regulating L1 family functions
APP interacts with neuronal-glial CAM (NgCAM), the chicken ortholog of L1, in the chick brain, and APP and sAPPα enhance NgCAM-dependent axon growth in retinal ganglion cells
In the mouse brain, APP interacts with another L1 family member, neurofascin
The functional role of this interaction remains to be investigated.

L1 family members in AD and their role in the amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ toxicity
In the CSF of AD patients, the levels of L1 proteolytic fragments are increased
The levels of full-length APP and αCTF are elevated in HEK293T cells co-expressing NgCAM, suggesting a role for the latter in modulation of APP stability and/or processing
Aβ 42 peptides bind to L1 in vitro via its second Fn3 domain
This interaction reduces the formation of high-molecular weight (MW) forms of AβOs, with a corresponding increase in levels of Aβ monomers, trimers, and tetramers.
Hippocampal L1 levels are reduced in aged APPswe mice, a mouse model of AD overexpressing human APP with a Swedish (KM670/671NL) mutation, which exhibits Aβ deposition with age
In APP/PS1 mice, a mouse AD model co-expressing mutated human APP with a Swedish mutation and mutated presenilin 1, overexpression of L1 using adeno-associated viruses results in a reduced Aβ plaque load and Aβ 42/40 ratio, as well as milder hippocampal synapse loss and astrogliosis
A 70 kDa fragment of L1 (L1-70) generated by proteolysis of L1 by serine proteases also reduces Aβ load in mice.
This occurs via translocation of L1-70 to the nucleus inducing cytokine expression and the clearance of Aβ plaques by activated microglia
While microglial activation is important for Aβ clearance, in prolonged or extreme form it results in inflammation exacerbating neuronal damage in AD
Together, these findings allude to a protective role for L1 in AD via the prevention of aggregation and promotion of Aβ clearance.

Contactins
Contactins are a family of CAMs within the IgSF comprising six members, including contactin-1 (also designated F3), contactin-2 (also named TAG1 or TAX1), contactin-3 (also named BIG-1 or PANG), contactin-4 (also designated BIG-2), contactin-5 (also named NB-2), and contactin-6 (also designated NB-3).
Contactins are composed of six Ig domains and four Fn3 domains attached to plasma membrane via a GPI anchor (Figure
They are primarily expressed in the brain where they accumulate in axons, contributing to control of axon growth and guidance, as well as to other functions distinct for each family member

Role of APP in regulating contactin family functions
In the mouse brain, APP was shown to interact with contactin-1
Contactin-3 and -4 were demonstrated to interact with APP in the chick brain
In vitro assays show that contactin-3 and -4 bind to APP with the highest affinity amongst the contactin family via a conserved interaction interface between the E1 CuBD of APP and second Fn3 domain of Contactin-3 and -4
Contactin-5 also binds to APP via this interface, suggesting the binding site is likely to be similar for all contactins
Contactin-1 and -2 show little to no binding to APP in these in vitro assays, suggesting additional factors may mediate such interactions in the brain.
Contactin-6 does not bind to APP in vitro, and this interaction has not thus far been identified in vivo, potentially making contactin-6 unique within the contactin family.
The interaction of contactin-4 with APP is required for axontarget matching in mouse retinal ganglion cells, regulating the circuitry involved in vision stabilization
The physiological role of the interactions between other contactins and APP is yet to be determined.

Contactin family members in AD and their role in the amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ toxicity
In mice, contactin-1 expression in the hippocampus decreases with age being associated with age-dependent cognitive decline
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the contactin-2 coding gene are associated with late-onset AD and contactin-2 CSF levels are reduced in AD and correlate with Aβ 40 and hyperphosphorylated tau levels
The levels of contactin-2 also decrease with age in mice
The chromosomal region encompassing the contactin-4 coding gene was found to have suggestive linkage to late-onset AD
Contactin-1 is suggested to modulate the α-/β-cleavage of APP as aged transgenic mice overexpressing contactin-1 display reduced sAPPβ and increased sAPPα levels compared to similarly aged wild-type mice
The levels of Aβ 42 are decreased, while the levels of Aβ 40 remain unchanged in these transgenic mice, suggesting that the preferred γ-cleavage site may also be influenced by contactin-1 overexpression.
Contactin-2 may similarly influence the α-/βcleavage of APP as mouse embryonic fibroblasts overexpressing contactin-2 show increased production of both αand β-CTFs, with a more prominent rise in α-CTF levels
However, contactin-2 does not affect sAPPα or sAPPβ levels in HEK293 cells or cultured cortical neurons
Contactin-2 promotes the γ-cleavage of APP-CTFs as demonstrated by a decrease in AICD release in CNTN2-/embryonic mouse brains
This contactin-2dependent γ-cleavage and release of AICD initiates a signaling pathway that inhibits neurogenesis (Figure
Contactin-2 is also suggested to suppress neuronal cell death, as it competitively inhibits the binding of transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2) to APP
In HEK293 cells, co-expression of contactin-4 increases the levels of full-length APP and αCTF suggesting that contactin-4 also regulates the processing of APP
Together, these data suggest that at least some members of the contactin family regulate the function and processing of APP, and that the age-related reduction in contactin expression may contribute to the shift towards amyloidogenic processing that leads to AD.

Other IgSF CAMs
The small GPI-anchored CAM Thy-1 has also been identified as a binding partner of APP
The role these interactions play in normal physiology and amyloid-dependent pathology requires further investigation.

Integrins
Integrins form a large and diverse family of ubiquitously expressed transmembrane CAMs
They are heterodimers composed of α and β subunits, combining to form at least 24 different pairs with distinct functions and expression patterns
Integrins are the primary mediators of cell-to-ECM adhesion throughout the body and serve a wide variety of functions including regulation of cellular growth and migration
Integrins are widely expressed in cells of the nervous system, where they play important roles in neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and neural immune function

Integrins interact with APP
In the mouse and rat brain, APP binds to β1-integrins and α3-integrins, but not to αM-integrins
APP colocalizes strongly with α1β1and α5β1-integrins in cultured neurons, and with α1β1but not α5β1-integrins in cultured astrocytes
The β1-integrin-APP complex is formed via the interaction of the E1 domain of APP with the extracellular domain of β1-integrin
Binding sites within APP for other integrin subunits remain unknown.
APP and β1-integrins may also be linked by cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, such as Dab1 and Fe65, which both APP and β1-integrins bind to

Role of APP in regulating integrin-dependent functions
Studies in multiple cell types suggest that APP regulates integrin-mediated adhesion, a function consistent with the ubiquitous expression of both proteins.
The loss of APP in endothelial cells reduces expression of β1-and β3-integrins, compromising attachment of cells to collagen and fibronectin substrates
Adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to collagen substrates is also dependent on APP expression, wherein adhesion induces the formation of a receptor complex containing β1-integrins and APP, initiating MAPK signaling and facilitating monocyte activation
In contrast, the loss of APP in mice leads to an increase in the levels of β1-and α3-integrins in the brain
In cultured neurons, blockade of β1-integrins with anti-β1integrin antibodies leads to inhibition of neurite outgrowth induced by sAPPα, suggesting that β1-integrins function as receptors for soluble forms of APP

β1-integrins regulate the processing of APP
In cultured hippocampal neurons overexpressing β1-integrin and APP, APP internalization is reduced and APP levels at the cell surface are increased
In agreement, overexpression of β1-integrins in HEK293 cells endogenously expressing APP leads to an increase in sAPPα production, however, this effect could not be reproduced in cultured cortical neurons
The levels of β1-integrins are reduced in the brain of the Tg2576 mouse model of AD overexpressing a mutant form of APP (isoform 695) with the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL).
This model displays elevated Aβ levels and ultimately amyloid plaques
Integrin-mediated signaling was also implicated in the control of APP processing in several genome-wide siRNA screens
β1-integrins interact with a 109 amino acid APP-CTF
They may therefore bind to αand β-CTFs of APP and influence their γ-cleavage.

Role of integrins in Aβ toxicity
Integrins bind to Aβ monomers, oligomers, and fibrils.
The RHDS sequence located near the N-terminus of Aβ is similar to the known integrin recognition sequence RGDS
CHO cells expressing α5β1-integrins attach to nonfibrillar Aβ-coated surfaces, and this attachment is blocked by soluble RGDS sequence-containing peptides or anti-α5-integrin antibodies
The binding of integrins to Aβ is subunit specific because CHO cells expressing αvβ1-integrin, but not αvβ3-integrin, also attach to Aβ-coated surfaces.
Aβ 40 peptides also bind to αIIbβ3-integrin (platelet integrin) via the RHDS sequence, however, other sequences in Aβ 40 are also involved
The binding of α6-integrins and β1-integrins to AβF is mediated by an epitope distinct from the RHDS sequence
β1-integrin also binds AβOs, and β1-integrin conditional knock-out mice demonstrate reduced binding of AβOs to neurons
The binding of AβOs to β1-integrins in neurons results in the activation of cofilin, an f-actin severing protein, leading to the depletion of f-actin, mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation, and apoptosis
β1-integrin also mediates a transient increase in spine density and dendritic complexity following AβO treatment
Changes in function of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glial cells of the central nervous system, are associated with the onset of neurodegeneration in AD.
It is noteworthy that the binding of AβOs to β1-integrin in oligodendrocytes leads to the activation of protein tyrosine kinase Fyn and serine/threonine-specific Ca 2+ / calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), promoting differentiation, maturation, and survival of these cells
This may represent a physiological role of Aβ which may be lost in favor of toxicity with chronic Aβ exposure.
Binding of AβF to β1-integrin in neurons results in activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the focal adhesion scaffolding protein, paxillin, leading to the formation of aberrant focal adhesion-like structures
AβF-induced neuronal dystrophy is dependent on β1-integrin-induced paxillin activation, indicating that dysregulation of focal adhesions may be central to Aβ toxicity (Figure
Furthermore, AβFinduced neurotoxicity appears to be driven by the MAPK pathway, dependent on specific integrins, with neurotoxicity mediated by α1-integrin in hippocampal neurons and α2-, αV, and β1-integrins in cortical neurons
Binding of AβF to a receptor complex composed of α6β1-integrin, IgSF CAM CD47, and B-class scavenger receptor CD36 in microglia, immune effector cells of the central nervous system, causes Fyn activation, triggering microglial cell activation and leading to a potentially deleterious inflammatory response
Tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling via this receptor complex induces phagocytosis of AβF, which may facilitate Aβ clearance
Blockade of β1-integrins prevents AβFinduced tyrosine kinase signaling, ROS generation, and interleukin-1β production in THP-1 monocytes
AβF also stimulates histamine secretion from mast cells via binding to a β1-integrin-CD47 receptor complex
While aberrant overactivation of some integrin signaling pathways appears to be a common response to Aβ, other integrin-dependent pathways are silenced in AD mouse models.
For example, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) levels and activity are reduced in APP/PS1 mice expressing a chimeric mouse/human APP with a Swedish mutation and a mutant human presenilin 1 in the central nervous system neurons.
Overexpression of ILK rescues hippocampal neurogenesis and memory deficits in this AD mouse model
Integrin-mediated cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM adhesion also appears to be a target of Aβ toxicity, as Aβ peptides partially block β1-integrin-mediated adhesion of SH-SY5Y cells to a fibronectin substrate
AβOs induce the loss of cell surface β1integrins in cultured neurons and α1β1-integrins in neuroblastoma cell lines
Overexpression of α5β1-integrins in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells results in inhibition of Aβ-induced apoptosis

Cadherins
Cadherins are a family of widely expressed CAMs characterized by the presence of the extracellular cadherin (EC) domains and mediating calcium-dependent homophilic adhesion between cells.
Classical cadherins such as E-or N-cadherin are transmembrane glycoproteins with a short cytoplasmic tail and extracellular domain composed of five EC domains (Figure
Other cadherins contain variable numbers of EC and other domains.
Cadherins play various roles in regulating cell migration, cytoskeleton organization, and are crucial components of adherens junctions in epithelia and endothelia
In the N-cadherin-induced APP homodimerization may promote β-cleavage and Aβ generation, however, this mechanism needs to be confirmed.
(C) APP forms a complex with the non-classical cadherin, calsyntenin-1, and adaptor protein Mint2.
The APP-Mint2 interaction, which may suppress Aβ generation, is stabilized in the tripartite complex with calsyntenin-1, thus enabling greater suppression of Aβ generation.
Formation of the APP-Mint2-calsyntenin-1 complex also precludes calsyntenin-1 processing, reducing generation of the γ-cleavage product, calsyntenin-1 ICD, which disrupts the APP-Mint2-calsyntenin-1 complex.
Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin.org
brain, cadherins regulate neurite outgrowth and the formation of synaptic contacts, and are important for overall neural development
Cadherins in AD and their role in the amyloidogenic processing of APP
The levels of N-cadherin proteolytic fragments are increased in the CSF and plasma of AD patients
In the mouse brain, N-cadherin interacts with APP and enhances APP homodimerization as well as production of sAPPβ and Aβ (Asada-Utsugi et al., 2011) (Figure
Similarly to APP, E-cadherin is processed by ADAM10 and γ-secretase
The cytoplasmic fragment of E-cadherin, termed E-cad/CTF2, which is released following γ-secretase cleavage of E-cadherin, interacts with APP-CTFs in CHO cells, promoting their lysosomal degradation and inhibiting the production of Aβ and AICD
E-cadherin was identified as an interacting partner of APP in silico using a protein-protein interaction tool
This approach also identified β-catenin, which is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that links E-cadherin to the cytoskeleton
In the mouse brain, APP interacts with the non-classical cadherins calsyntenin-1 and -3
These cell adhesion molecules are highly expressed in neurons and accumulate in the post-synaptic membrane
Calsyntenin-1 forms a complex with APP and Mint2, stabilizing the APP-Mint2 interaction, suppressing amyloidogenic processing and reducing Aβ production
Accordingly, calsyntenin-1 deficiency in APP23 mice results in increased plaque deposition.
On the other hand, the intracellular domain of calsyntenin-1 released following γ-secretase cleavage (calsyntenin-1 ICD) disrupts the APP-Mint2-Calsyntenin-1 complex, promoting Aβ generation
Since the tripartite complex additionally protects calsyntenin-1 from cleavage

Neurexins and neuroligins
Neurexins are a family of transmembrane CAMs, which includes three classical neurexins (neurexin-1 to -3) and five contactin-associated proteins (Caspr-1 to -5) named for their close association with contactins.
Each neurexin gene encodes an α and β isoform, which differ in their extracellular part.
The extracellular domains of α-neurexins are composed of six laminin G-like domains and three EGF-like regions, while the extracellular domains of β isoforms contain only a single laminin G-like repeat
The extracellular domains of contactin-associated proteins contain four laminin G-like domains, two EGF-like regions, an F5/8 type C domain, and a fibrinogen-like part (Figure
Neuroligins are a family of transmembrane CAMs, which includes five members (neuroligin-1 to -3, 4X and 4Y).
The extracellular domains of neuroligins mostly consist of an acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-homologous domain, which binds in a calcium-dependent manner to the laminin G-like domains of neurexins
The interaction between presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins plays an important role in synapse formation and maturation being critical for overall neural development

Role of neurexin family members in the amyloidogenic processing of APP
Cytosolic domains of neurexins and APP interact with Mint1 and Mint2
APP also interacts with Caspr-1 in the mouse brain
Caspr-1 interacts with and is cleaved by γ-secretase, and its silencing results in a drastic reduction of Aβ production in HEK293 cells
The levels of Caspr-1 are increased in APP/PS1 mice
Caspr-1 loss of function leads to a decrease in sAPPα production in brain endothelial cells via transcriptional regulation of the secondary α-secretase ADAM9
Interestingly, Caspr-1 overexpression results in reduced levels of APP, APP-CTFs and Aβ in CHO cells transfected with APP containing an Indiana (V717F) mutation

Role of neurexin family members in Aβ toxicity
AβOs bind to neurexin-1, -2, and -3 in transfected COS7 cells
The binding of AβOs to βneurexins has no effect on neurexin-neuroligin interactions but hinders the neurexin-mediated excitatory presynaptic differentiation observed when hippocampal neurons were co-cultured together with neuroligin-expressing HEK293 cells.
This occurs via a reduction in neurexin-1β levels at the axonal cell surface induced by AβOs (Figure
In accordance, β-neurexins, but not α-neurexins, are downregulated in synapses of the J20 APP mouse model of AD, which overexpresses human APP with the Swedish and Indiana mutations linked to familial AD
AβOs also bind neurexin-2α in human brain tissue
Blockade of the neurexin-2α-AβO interaction using antibodies against neurexin-2α reduces the binding of AβOs to cultured hippocampal neurons and prevents AβO-induced oxidative stress and synapse loss.
AβO-induced memory impairment in mice is attenuated after injection of the aforementioned anti-neurexin-2α antibodies
Neurexins-1, -2, and -3 have been reported to bind to AβF in CSF of AD patients

Role of neuroligins in Aβ toxicity
AβOs bind to neuroligin-1 in human brain tissue and in the rat brain
Blockade of the neuroligin-1-AβO interaction reduces binding of AβOs to neurons, inhibits AβO-induced oxidative stress and synapse loss in cultured neurons, and prevents memory impairments in mice
Soluble neuroligin-1 binds to AβOs and reduces excitatory synaptotoxicity
On the other hand, neuroligin-1 deficient neurons are more vulnerable to AβO-induced toxicity, and AβO-induced impairments in learning are more severe in neuroligin-1 deficient mice
Neuroligin-1 levels are also reduced in the hippocampus of people with AD
These seemingly contradictory findings may suggest that although neuroligin-1 mediates toxicity via its interaction with AβOs, loss of neuroligin-1 and its associated physiological functions may weaken synapses and increase vulnerability to AβO toxicity through other receptors.
AβOs also bind to neuroligin-2, but not neuroligin-3
In contrast to neuroligin-1, neuroligin-2 is localized to inhibitory synapses

Prion protein
The cellular prion protein (PrP c ) is a small glycoprotein wellknown for its role in prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, where it exists in a misfolded and aggregated form termed prion protein scrapie (PrP Sc )
PrP c consists of a disordered N-terminal domain and C-terminal α-helical region attached to the membrane via a GPI anchor
PrP c is expressed in a variety of tissues but is particularly enriched in the brain where is plays a role in regulating cell adhesion, neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and myelin maintenance

Role of APP in regulating PrP c -dependent functions
PrP c interacts with APP in the mouse brain, zebrafish, and N2a cells
APP was pulled down from human brain lysate with the N-terminal domain of PrP c used as bait
In zebrafish embryos, knockdown of either APP or PrP c homologs was shown to have no effect on cell aggregation, however, knockdown of both significantly reduced the propensity for aggregation.
The loss of APP in zebrafish results in increased seizures upon exposure to low doses of convulsant, and this effect is lost in fish lacking PrP c suggesting that APP regulates neuronal excitability in a PrP c -dependent manner

PrP c in AD and its role in the amyloidogenic processing of APP
There are some similarities between prion diseases and AD, and the gene encoding for PrP c (Prpn) has been identified as a potential susceptibility gene for AD
PrP c levels are reduced in the temporal cortex of patients suffering from sporadic AD, and this reduction correlates with increased clinical severity of the disease
PrP c modulates APP processing by interacting with BACE1, where PrP c binds to immature BACE1 in the Golgi, preventing its export and maturation
PrP c reduces Aβ levels in mouse brains, and PrP c levels inversely correlate with Aβ load in AD
It is unknown whether PrP c also controls APP processing by directly interacting with APP.

Role of PrP c in Aβ toxicity
AβOs bind to the N-terminal region of PrP c in AD brains but not in brains of non-demented controls (Chen et al., 2010;
The efficiency of AβO binding to the neuronal surface is strongly reduced in cultured Prpn-/-neurons, and AβOs fail to inhibit hippocampal LTP in Prpn-/-mice indicating that PrP c is one of the major neuronal receptors for AβOs
The AβO-induced LTP impairment is also reduced in rats after intracerebroventricular administration of antibody fragments directed to a putative Aβ-binding site on PrP c
Furthermore, PrP c shedding due to cleavage by ADAM10 decreases AβO binding to iPSCderived neurons, resulting in reduced toxicity (Jarosz-
Binding of AβO to PrP c leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels, causes synaptotoxicity, and induces activation of Fyn kinase leading to tau hyperphosphorylation
PrP c transmits signals across the plasma membrane by binding to LRP1
NCAMs, which bind both PrP c and Fyn, may also be involved
Binding of AβO to PrP c has been shown to hinder PrP c -dependent BACE1 inhibition, likely promoting further Aβ production and accumulation
Binding of AβO to PrP c at the cell surface leads to an increase in PrP c levels here by limiting PrP c endocytosis
An orally administered PrP c agonist that blocks binding of AβOs to PrP c rescues memory impairment and synaptic loss in transgenic APP/PS1 mice
The effects of the PrP c agonist are seen in 12-month-old mice, when Aβ accumulation has already occurred, and memory impairment and synaptic loss are evident
These data suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting the PrP c -AβO interaction may prove effective at restoring brain health in individuals already diagnosed with AD.

CAMs of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily
CAMs of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily are characterized by the presence of leucine rich-repeats (LRRs) in their extracellular domains.
Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) are a family within the LRR superfamily consisting of four members (LRRTM-1 to -4).
They are singlepass transmembrane proteins with short cytoplasmic tails and extracellular domains comprising ten LRRs (Figure
LRRTMs mediate synaptic adhesion by binding to neurexins
A family of fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane (FLRT) proteins also belongs to the LRR superfamily.
Three members of this family (FLRT-1 to -3) are single-pass transmembrane proteins with ten extracellular LRR domains and a juxtamembrane Fn3 domain (Figure
FLRTs mediate synaptic adhesion by binding to latrophilins
LRRTMs and FLRTs play an important role in synapse formation and regulation
LRR superfamily CAMs in AD and their role in the amyloidogenic processing of APP LRRTM3 was identified as a candidate gene for AD from an siRNA screening of over 15,000 genes
SNPs within the promoter and intronic regions of the gene coding for LRRTM3 are associated with AD
LRRTM3 interacts with APP in HEK293 cells and colocalizes with APP in cultured neurons
siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRRTM3 leads to a reduction in sAPPβ and β-CTF levels and Aβ secretion in SH-SY5Y cells
APP also interacts with FLRT1 and FLRT3 in HEK293T cells
The functional role of this interaction remains unclear.

Conclusions and outlook
The amyloid hypothesis places APP and Aβ at the center of AD etiology, however, our understanding of the normal functions of APP, regulation of its processing, and the mechanisms of Aβinduced toxicity are still incomplete.
These knowledge gaps have been showcased by the failures of therapeutics targeting APP processing and Aβ, which have been unable to demonstrate reasonable efficacy
While the physiological functions of APP are incompletely understood, its general role in regulating cell adhesion is suggested by multiple reports showing that APP not only interacts with different CAMs, but also regulates multiple functions of these proteins, including cell adhesion and neuronal growth regulation.
CAMs also emerged as important regulators of the processing of APP with some CAMs promoting amyloidogenic pathway and others enhancing the nonamyloidogenic pathway.
In addition to its role in AD pathogenesis, Aβ plays physiological roles in learning and memory
It is therefore possible that the CAM-regulated switches in the modes of APP processing are functionally important, however, the roles these switches play in the healthy brain remains poorly understood and should be analyzed in the future.
Substantial evidence indicates that CAMs function as the cell surface receptors for Aβ and its oligomers.
While a possible physiological role of these interactions remains also unknown, the binding of Aβ to CAMs clearly plays a role in AD by inducing aberrant signaling pathways and loss of CAM-mediated adhesion.
Interestingly, some CAMs inhibit the formation of large Aβ oligomers, suggesting these proteins are involved in the regulation of Aβ turnover in the brain.
Together, the research outlined here highlights the importance of the interplay between CAMs and APP during normal physiology, a factor which should be considered when developing therapeutics that target APP as they may impact these functions.
On the other hand, modulation of the interactions between APP and CAMs may represent an attractive therapeutic approach to reduce Aβ generation while limiting side effects due to overzealous obstruction of APP and its proteases.
Finally, inhibition of the binding of Aβ to CAMs may be used to prevent the binding of Aβ to the neuronal surface and reduce the Aβ-induced toxic effects.
There are still major gaps in our understanding of the role that CAMs play in APP and Aβ-dependent functions.
Future research should focus on the mechanisms underpinning the interactions of CAMs with APP and Aβ in the brain with the hope of aiding future endeavors to develop safe and effective therapies for AD.

(C) APP interacts with all contactin family members except for contactin-6.
The E1 CuBD of APP binds to the second Fn3 domain of contactin.
Contactin-1 promotes α-cleavage and reduces β-cleavage of APP, thereby reducing Aβ generation.
Contactin-2 promotes γ-cleavage of APP, thereby increasing AICD release and inhibiting neurogenesis.
Contactin-2 also inhibits the binding of APP to TGFβ2 and reduces apoptosis induced by APP-TGFβ2 interactions.
Contactin-4 regulates APP stability and processing and is required for APP-dependent axon-target matching.
The function of APP interactions with contactin-3 and -5 remains undetermined.

(iii) In monocytes, adhesion to a collagen substrate induces the formation of an APP-β1-integrin complex, which activates MAPK signaling resulting in monocyte activation.
(B) (i) In neurons, binding of AβOs to β1-integrins leads to a reduction in the cell surface levels of β1-integrins and compromised cell adhesion, and results in activation of the f-actin severing protein, cofilin, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation, leading to apoptosis.
(ii) AβFs bind several integrin subunits (β1, α1, α2, and αV) and induce MAPK activation and neurotoxicity.

(B) N-cadherin interacts with APP promoting its homodimerization, β-cleavage, and Aβ generation.
N-cadherin-induced APP homodimerization may promote β-cleavage and Aβ generation, however, this mechanism needs to be confirmed.
(C) APP forms a complex with the non-classical cadherin, calsyntenin-1, and adaptor protein Mint2.
The APP-Mint2 interaction, which may suppress Aβ generation, is stabilized in the tripartite complex with calsyntenin-1, thus enabling greater suppression of Aβ generation.
Formation of the APP-Mint2-calsyntenin-1 complex also precludes calsyntenin-1 processing, reducing generation of the γ-cleavage product, calsyntenin-1 ICD, which disrupts the APP-Mint2-calsyntenin-1 complex.
