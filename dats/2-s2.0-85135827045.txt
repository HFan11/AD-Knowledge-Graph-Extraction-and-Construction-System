An accurate fully automated panel of plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease
Introduction: There is a great need for fully automated plasma assays that can measure amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology and predict future Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.
Methods: Two cohorts (n = 920) were examined: Panel A+ (n = 32 cognitively unimpaired [CU], n = 106 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and n = 89 AD) and BioFINDER-1 (n = 461 CU, n = 232 MCI).
Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, phosphorylated tau (ptau)181, two p-tau217 variants, ApoE4 protein, neurofilament light, and GFAP were measured using Elecsys prototype immunoassays.

INTRODUCTION
Even though there has been great progress in the development of accurate blood tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not yet been widely implemented in clinical practice.
Validation of blood biomarkers mainly focuses on clinical AD diagnosis
]
Having tests that accurately estimate the presence of abnormal Aβ accumulation ("Aβ positivity") is therefore crucial for identifying suitable persons to enroll in drug trials, for ensuring an accurate AD diagnosis,
Implementing blood tests for Aβ pathology would have great benefits because today's methods for identifying Aβ are either invasive, costly, or only available in specialized centers in some parts of the world (these include Aβ positron emission tomography [PET] and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] analysis).
Blood tests for Aβ may become even more important if ongoing prevention trials in cognitively unimpaired (CU) persons are successful.
In that case, Aβ positivity would have to be identified before cognitive impairment starts and it would also be important to predict who will progress to AD dementia (because those that remain stable for many years probably will not benefit the most from the drug).
In such screenings of CU individuals, the test would have to be as easily accessible, cost effective, and minimally invasive as possible.
Promising plasma biomarkers that specifically capture key AD processes are the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio,
,
step forward toward clinical implementation would thus be to establish the biomarkers on automated instruments that can run samples whenever they arrive at the laboratory with minimal manual steps and stable results over time (i.e., a fully automated approach).
This would allow for setting up the tests in ordinary clinical chemistry laboratories worldwide. Such i
struments have been implemented for CSF analyses
The primary aim of this study was to examine the clinical performance and diagnostic utility of a novel fully automated plasma biomarker panel for identifying Aβ positivity.
The secondary aim was to examine its ability to predict development of future AD dementia.
The panel included plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, two variants of p-tau217, NfL, GFAP, and the APOE ε4-encoded E4 isoform of ApoE (ApoE4; i.e., quantification of ApoE4 protein in plasma, not APOE genotyping).
This was examined in cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired participants using two independent cohorts (N = 920).
In addition, the association between the plasma biomarkers and corresponding CSF biomarkers was examined.
For plasma ApoE4, a comparison to the APOE genotype was performed.
Finally, the present plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 prototype assays were compared in a head-to-head analysis with previous versions on the same fully automated platform. 9
All patients gave their written informed consent, and the study was approved by the regional ethics committees in Ulm and Hannover, Germany.
The study participants were classified as (1) CU (n = 32), (2)   mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 106),

METHODS

Participants and clinical assessments
The Swedish BioFINDER study
The Swedish BioFINDER-1 study consecutively included participants between 2010 and 2015 from the southern part of Sweden (clinical trial ID: NCT01208675).
The participants were classified as CU
Study design and inclusion/exclusion criteria are described at
The participants were followed longitudinally at participating memory clinics with yearly (bi-annually for controls) follow-ups including cognitive testing, informant-based activities of daily living (ADL) questionnaires, and detailed assessments by physicians experienced in neurocognitive disorders.
All patients gave their written informed consent to participate, and the study was approved by the regional ethics committee in Lund, Sweden.

Plasma and CSF procedures
Plasma and CSF procedures have been published previously for BioFINDER and Panel A+.
Prototype immunoassays on cobas e 601 analyzers were used to analyze plasma Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181 using an antibody pair recognizing a mid-domain tau epitope, p-tau217 using an antibody pair recognizing an N-terminal tau epitope (p-tau217 N-terminal; Roche Diagnostics), p-tau217 using an antibody pair recognizing a mid-domain tau to analyze ApoE4, NfL, and GFAP for practical reasons to maximize throughput and the same aliquot was used on both instruments.
Note that the assays are designed to run on the same cobas instrument using one aliquot.
In the statistical analyses, plasma ApoE4 was empirically binarized at 0.9 μg/ml to provide a perfect separation between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers.
In addition to the above-described plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 assays, data from the previously published
The old assays were updated for the present plasma analysis in Panel A+ and then further modified for the analyses in BioFINDER (see Tables
CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, and p-tau181, were analyzed on cobas e 601 and NfL, and GFAP cobas e 411 analyzers using the Roche NeuroToolKit as previously described. 41

Outcomes
The primary outcome was Aβ status (abnormal/normal) determined using the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio.
The cutoff for Aβ positivity was established in an unbiased way using mixture modeling
statistics.
3]
e secondary outcome was progression to AD dementia (only BioFINDER) within 6 years.
Additional secondary outcomes were (1)
Aβ status (abnormal/normal) determined using the CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio and (2) Aβ PET imaging using 18F-Flutemetamol.
Further details of the outcomes are described in the supporting information.
The CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 cutoffs for Aβ positivity were > 0.024 in Panel A+ and > 0.018 in BioFINDER (established using mixture modelling statistics in the present populations).
For 18F-Flutemetamol PET, a previously published cut-off of > 0.53 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was used to define Aβ positivity.

Statistical analysis
Aβ status or progression to AD dementia were used as the dependent variables and the plasma biomarkers were used as independent vari-ables in logistic regression models.
Stepwise additions of biomarkers are shown in Figures
Accuracy was measured using the AUC and AUCs were compared using DeLong statistics.
R version 4.0 was used for all statistical analyses.

Prediction of future AD dementia in BioFINDER
Of 342 CU participants who either converted to dementia within 6 years or were followed for ≥ 6 years, 29 (8%) progressed to AD dementia, 22 (6%) progressed to other dementias, and 292 (85%) did not progress to dementia.
Plasma p-tau181 had the highest AUC for predicting progression to AD dementia (0.84, 95%CI 0.77 to 0.92; Figure
Combining p-tau181, p-tau217 mid-domain, and ApoE provided a non-significantly higher AUC (0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95; Figure
Of 194 participants with MCI who either converted to dementia within 6 years or were followed for ≥ 6 years, 99 (51%) progressed to AD dementia, 66 (34%) progressed to other dementias, and 30 (15%) did not progress to dementia.

Secondary analyses

Correlation between plasma and CSF biomarkers
Significant correlations among the biomarkers in BioFINDER are visualized in Figure
In BioFINDER, the Spearman rho between the corresponding plasma and CSF biomarkers were 0.63 for NfL, 0.54 for p-tau181, 0.54 for GFAP, and 0.40 for Aβ42/Aβ40.
In Panel A+ it was 0.64 for Aβ42/Aβ40 and 0.52 for p-tau181.
Note that Elecsys CSF NfL and GFAP were not available in Panel A+ and CSF p-tau217 was not available in either cohort.

Plasma ApoE4 concentrations and APOE genotype
As shown in Figure
Dichotomized plasma ApoE4 concentration separated APOE ε4 carriers versus non-carriers perfectly, but with a partial overlap between one and two ε4 alleles.
As predictor of Aβ status in Panel A+, number of ε4 alleles had an AUC of 0.80, which was non-significantly different from binarized plasma ApoE4 (0.78; P = 0.61).
In the larger BioFINDER cohort, a similar AUC difference was significant (number of ε4 alleles, 0.75; binarized plasma ApoE4, 0.73; P < 0.001).

DISCUSSION
Using the Elecsys prototype immunoassays on fully automated instruments, the combination of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and ApoE4 had high accuracy in two independent cohorts for identifying Aβ positivity (AUCs 0.90 to 0.93), with similar results in CU and MCI subgroups and when using alternative outcomes (CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 or Aβ PET).
A combination of three biomarkers could predict progression to AD dementia within 6 years with AUCs of 0.88 (among CU) and 0.87 (among MCI; Figure
Measuring plasma ApoE4 concentration perfectly separated APOE ε4 carriers (identified by genotyping) from non-carriers (Figure
Finally, the updated plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 assays had significantly better accuracy for detecting cerebral Aβ compared to the previous versions.
The greatest novelty of the present study lies in the transformation of all key AD biomarkers onto a fully automated platform (Elecsys immunoassays on a cobas e analyzer).
This platform has been well validated for CSF AD biomarkers in several large cohorts and has been implemented for use in routine clinical practice worldwide.
This was demonstrated by the low CVs (< 4.5%) for all plasma biomarkers (Tables
For plasma analyses, however, there is only one previous study examining Aβ42 and Aβ40 Elecsys assays.
In the present study, we showed that the updated Elecsys Aβ42/Aβ40 assays had higher accuracy for Aβ positivity with precise/robust measurements (CVs of 0.4% to 2.9%; see Table
The large overlap between the Aβ positive and negative groups A novelty of the plasma biomarker panel was to measure plasma ApoE4 protein concentrations, which perfectly separated APOE ɛ4 carriers from non-carriers (Figure
In terms of estimating Aβ positivity, ApoE4 provides similar information as APOE genotyping, but it may facilitate test logistics and implementation.
Instead of sending a separate blood sample for APOE genotyping, the present approach allows for an analysis of all essential biomarkers at the same laboratory and on the same instrument from the same sample.
In addition to being a risk marker for future and present Aβ pathology, ApoE4 plays an important role in the risk/benefit assessment before starting anti-Aβ treatment.
Note, however, that plasma ApoE4 did not perfectly separate carriers of one versus two ɛ4 alleles and in instances in which that needs to be specified, traditional APOE genotyping must still be performed.
Regarding p-tau, we compared one p-tau181 and two p-tau217 assays (a mid-domain antibody and an N-terminal antibody).
Compared to using p-tau217 mid-domain on other platforms such as the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), 2 the present accuracies were lower and suggest that further optimization is needed.
The p-tau217 N-terminal had higher accuracies for Aβ positivity than the mid-domain assay (Figures 1A and 3A-3C; Tables S7, S10, S13, and S15), but on the other hand had a much higher number of participants below the detection limit (discussed in the Limitations section).
For plasma p-tau181, there were no participants below detection limit and its performance both as a single biomarker and in combination with Aβ42/Aβ40 and ApoE4 was overall similar to p-tau217.
This highlights that although p-tau217 has performed better in previous studies for identifying AD pathology, 2,4,52-55 the type of analysis platform might be just as important
Combining Aβ42/Aβ40, ApoE4, and p-tau181, high AUCs were achieved in both cohorts (AUC 0.90 to 0.93), and in separate populations of CU (AUC 0.89) and MCI (AUC 0.89) participants (Figures
Although adding additional biomarkers such as GFAP improved model fit (important from the aspect of robust measurements over time and between populations), it did not consistently increase the accuracy for Aβ positivity further (Figure
For predicting development of future AD dementia in BioFINDER, other biomarker combinations had the best performances (Figure
Similar to previous studies, 2,27 plasma p-tau biomarkers performed best as single biomarkers both in the CU and MCI groups (Figure
When identifying the optimal combination of biomarkers, both p-tau181 and p-tau217 were selected and provided independent information about progression to AD dementia (Figure
When using a combination of biomarkers to estimate cerebral Aβ or progression to AD dementia, the individual outcome is a probability (for Aβ positivity or AD) from 0 to 1 (Figure
Instead of defining individual biomarker cutoffs, the cutoff from a combination (i.e., logistic regression model) would naturally be > 0.5 (> 50% probability of Aβ positivity).
Alternatively, more information from the biomarker results could be used if results are stratified (low, intermediate, high probability) or even on a continuous scale with the probability of Aβ positivity ranging from 0% to 100% as implemented in recently published biomarker algorithms.
e main limitation of the present study was that measured plasma p-tau217 N-terminal and mid-domain concentrations were in many cases below the lower level of detection (Table
For p-tau217 Nterminal, 39% had to be assigned the calculation minimum level and for p-tau217 mid-domain, 18% (Table
However, > 90% of Aβ positive participants had levels above the calculation limit for p-tau217 mid-domain and > 80% for p-tau217 N-terminal.
This indicates that these unmeasurably low levels to a large extent represent true low concentrations and being able to measure lower concentration might not change the accuracy noticeably.
Nonetheless, this issue highlights that further assay optimization is needed and this is also why we advocate the use of p-tau181 on this platform instead.
As for future novel biomarkers, it would be interesting to examine other both shorter and longer Aβ peptide ratios such as Aβ37/Aβ42, as recently shown to be promising.
summary, we found that using a fully automated instrument, a combination of three biomarkers identified Aβ positivity in two independent cohorts with high accuracy and predicted development of future AD dementia.
The findings could be important in the implementation of blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnostics, recruitment in AD trials, and monitoring anti-Aβ therapies because of the high precision (intra-and inter-instrument CV) in combination with a high accuracy.
Important steps in a clinical implementation process are to validate the assays' accuracy and robustness when analyzing samples over longer periods of time using predefined cut-offs and to examine the performance in more diverse populations.

One way of overcoming this might be to use a combination of biomarkers that more clearly separate the groups and is less sensitive to errors in a single biomarker assay (Figure2H).
