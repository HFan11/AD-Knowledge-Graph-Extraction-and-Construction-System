Derivatives of the β-Crinane Amaryllidaceae Alkaloid Haemanthamine as Multi-Target Directed Ligands for Alzheimer’s Disease
Twelve derivatives 1a-1m of the β-crinane-type alkaloid haemanthamine were developed.
All the semisynthetic derivatives were studied for their inhibitory potential against both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase.
In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) inhibition potency was evaluated in the active derivatives.
In order to reveal the availability of the drugs to the CNS, we elucidated the potential of selected derivatives to penetrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Two compounds, namely 11-O-(2-methylbenzoyl)-haemanthamine (1j) and 11-O-(4-nitrobenzoyl)-haemanthamine (1m), revealed the most intriguing profile, both being acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) inhibitors on a micromolar scale, with GSK-3β inhibition properties, and predicted permeation through the BBB.
In vitro data were further corroborated by detailed inspection of the compounds' plausible binding modes in the active sites of hAChE and hBuChE, which led us to provide the structural determinants responsible for the activity towards these enzymes.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the one with the strongest societal impact with regard to incidence, prevalence, mortality rate, and cost of care
AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for up 80% of all dementia cases.
In 2010, about 36 million people suffered from AD worldwide, and by 2050 it is estimated that this number will reach up to 144 million AD patients
AD pathogenesis is complex and comprises genetic and environmental factors that define AD as a multifactorial syndrome.
Pathological changes in the brain of a patient with AD can occur more than twenty years before clinical symptoms are apparent
From a neuropathological point of view, the brain of AD patients is characterized by the presence of two biomarkers: senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of the hyperphosphorylated τ-protein
SPs are extracellular deposits composed of various peptide fragments {Aβ  and Aβ  } derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP)
These proteins generate deposits in specific areas of the brain, and are considered as critical factors for memory loss and cognitive impairment in AD patients
Neuronal cells commonly express τ-protein, where its purpose is to stabilize the microtubules.
Precise regulation of phosphorylation of τ-protein is probably important for its normocellular functioning; aberrant τ-protein hyperphosphorylation is believed to disrupt cellular processes such as axonal transport.
In AD, hyperphosphorylated τ-protein accumulates and aggregates into paired helical filaments, and loses its microtubule binding and stabilizing role
Phosphorylation of τ-proteins is primarily dependent on glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)
Genetic and epidemiological studies indicate that GSK-3β is deregulated in AD through alterations in upstream Wnt and insulin signaling pathway intermediates.
GSK-3β is also cross-linked to Aβ since it may also induce its formation into aggregates
However, the roles of CDK5 and GSK3 in tau hyperphosphorylation are not fully established, and it remains to determine the critical factors leading to abnormal τ-protein hyperphosphorylation.
Additionally, the disease is accompanied by cholinergic dysfunction in the CNS.
The role of cholinergic neurotransmission in AD is the basis of the widely accepted cholinergic hypothesis
Current clinical treatment of AD involves the use of reversible inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE, E.C. 3.1.1.7)
Besides posing an enhancing effect to neuronal transmission, it has also been observed that AChE accelerates the assembly of Aβ into amyloid fibrils
Currently, there are three approved drugs acting as reversible inhibitors of AChE-donepezil, galanthamine and rivastigmine
Similarly to AChE, another cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; E.C.
can also inactivate ACh.
The later stages of AD are usually accompanied by decreased AChE activity, in contrast to BuChE level, which remains either normal or even elevated in the brain
Traditional use of plants of the Amaryllidaceae family in folk medicine dates back to the fourth century BC, when Hippocrates of Cos used oil from the daffodil Narcissus poeticus L., for the treatment of uterine tumors
The major secondary metabolites of the family are alkaloids, which are characterized by unique skeleton arrangements and a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antitumor
Notably, some species of Amaryllidaceae produce the alkaloid galanthamine, which was isolated for the first time from Galanthus woronowii in the 1950s, and at the beginning of this century was approved for the treatment of mild to moderate stages of AD being a competitive AChE inhibitor with modulatory properties towards nicotinic ACh receptors
Other alkaloids isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants like narciclasine, haemanthamine, pancratistatine and lycorine (Figure
Moreover, other studies also pointed out various pharmacological properties of semisynthetic derivatives of some Amaryllidaceae alkaloids such as those related to haemanthamine
Haemanthamine is a β-crinane-type alkaloid that is found in some Amaryllidaceae plants in high concentrations.
Moreover, it can be easily isolated from different Narcissus species for semisynthetic reactions.
Haemanthamine itself displays significant in vitro cytotoxic activity against several different types of cancer cell lines including MOLT-4, HepG2, HeLa, MCF7, CEM, K562, A549

Nowadays the portfolio of drugs used for treatment of AD is narrow
As a part of our ongoing research on Amaryllidaceae alkaloids being potential drugs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, we have carried out modifications of the structure of the β-crinane type alkaloid haemanthamine
The obtained derivatives were evaluated for their potency for the inhibition of enzymes connected with the potential treatment of AD (hAChE, hBuChE, and GSK-3β).
Drugs targeting the CNS need to be able to pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and thus the potential of the selected derivatives to penetrate this was also studied.
In vitro data were further corroborated by detailed inspection of the drugs' plausible binding modes in the active sites of hAChE and hBuChE, which allowed us to establish some preliminary structure-activity relationships.

Biological Profile of Haemanthamine and Haemanthamine Derivatives 1a-1m
The primary goal of the development of 1 derivatives was to investigate them as novel chemical probes with potential higher cytotoxic activity against tumor cell lines and compare them with the parent compound 1, while maintaining low toxicity to healthy cells.
As reported previously, 1 displayed pronounced cell growth inhibitory activities against a variety of tumor cells
This action is presumably mediated by inhibiting early stages of ribosome biogenesis via p53-dependent antitumoral stress response
Up to date, there are only a few studies devoted to drug design and biological activities of the derivatives of 1
Interestingly, 1 was found to be completely inactive to both cholinesterases.
In the first step we decided to prepare a library of six aliphatic (compounds 1a-1e) and six aromatic esters (compounds 1g-1m).
Out of these compounds, only two (1a, 1c) have been described previously
The antiproliferative effect of 1a-1m at 10 μM single-dose treatment regimen was assessed using WST-1 tetrazolium salt assay.
Interestingly, none of the derivatives displayed any considerable toxicity against the tested human cell lines (Jurkat, MOLT-4, A549, HT-29, PANC-1, A2780, HeLa, MCF-7, SAOS-2 and MRC-5) during 48 h of exposure, which is in striking contrast with 1 that elicited potent cytotoxic and apoptotic effects.
Mean values for each cell line proliferation are shown in Supplementary material.
In the next step, the low cytotoxicity of the prepared derivatives led us to investigate the interaction of 1a-1m with cholinesterases, and GSK-3β.
Interestingly, some derivatives exerted promising inhibitory activities against cholinesterases (Table
All aliphatic esters 1a-1f displayed either weak (1 mM ≥ IC50 ≥ 200 μM) or no (IC50 ≥ 1000 μM) inhibition activity in the cholinesterase assay.
The presence of an aromatic acyl-, as in compounds 1g-1m, seems to be crucial for the hAChE and hBuChE inhibitory potency.
The most active inhibitors of hAChE were 11-O-(4-nitrobenzoyl)haemanthamine (1m) and 11-O-(2-methylbenzoyl)haemanthamine (1j), both displaying two-digit micromolar IC50 values (Table
The unsubstituted analogue 11-Obenzoylhaemanthamine (1g) revealed reduced potency by one order of magnitude.
Analogue 11-O-(2-methylbenzoyl)haemanthamine (1j) showed a non-selective profile for both cholinesterases in the micromolar scale.
Kinetic analysis of 1j and 1m was used for the determination of their inhibition pattern against both hAChE and hBuChE.
Results are shown using Lineweaver-Burk plots (Figure

Selected haemanthamine derivatives (compounds 1g, 1j and 1m) were screened for their GSK-3β inhibition potency at a concentration of 10 μM.
Since 1m revealed the highest inhibition potency in the tested concentration scale, its IC50 was further determined demonstrating a slightly less potent profile compared with the native Amaryllidaceae alkaloids masonine, caranine, and narcimatuline
The crucial part in the process of AD therapeutic drug development is the ability of the drug to reach the CNS, thus crossing the BBB.
The screening for BBB penetration in early drug discovery programs provides important information for compound selection
The majority of CNS drugs enter the brain by transcellular passive diffusion, thus, the evaluation of ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties is of importance to reduce attrition in the development process.
The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was selected as a useful technique to predict passive diffusion through biological membranes
The in vitro permeability (Pe) through the lipid membrane of commercial drugs was determined together with compounds 1g, 1j and 1m (Table
An assay validation was made comparing the reported permeability values of the commercial drugs with our experimental data (see Figure
A good correlation between experimental and described values was obtained Pe (exptl) = 0.9079 (bibl) -0.696 (R 2 = 0.974).
Following the pattern established in the literature for BBB permeation prediction we could classify compounds under the survey (1g, 1j and 1m) as centrally active having Pe values > 4.00 × 10 -6 cm s -1 (Table
However, the PAMPA assay uses artificial membranes to observe passive membrane permeability, thus neglecting the special characteristics of the BBB.
For this reason we also exploited another methodology calculating logBB for active haemanthamine derivatives 1g, 1j and 1m.
LogBB is the most common numeric value describing permeability across the BBB.
It is defined as the logarithmic ratio between the concentration of a compound in the brain (Cbrain) and blood (Cblood)
LogBB values of the calculated compounds vary from 0.007 to 0.285.
Compounds with logBB > 0.3 readily cross the BBB, while those with logBB < -1.0 are only poorly distributed to the brain
The obtained results for both the PAMPA assay and logBB calculation indicated that the novel derivatives represent compounds with potential to permeate through the BBB.

Docking Studies
In order to understand better the structural basis of hAChE and hBuChE inhibition by the new semi-synthetic alkaloids reported herein, we have conducted a computational study to identify a binding mode allowing us to account for the experimental SAR.
All the compounds were firstly submitted to a screening method employing docking with flexible residues with 20 repetitions for each ligand 1a-1m counting both cholinesterases, i.e., hAChE (PDB ID: 4EY7) and hBuChE (PDB ID: 4BDS)
The selection of these enzymes is in accordance with the in vitro testing where enzymes of human origin were also used.
The binding energies for the top-scored docking poses are collected in Table
The results for hAChE nicely fit those obtained in vitro, even though this has to be taken with precaution since no clear correlation has been established between the scoring functions from in silico and data from in vitro
In the case of hAChE inhibition, more potent inhibitors, i.e., those possessing IC 50 s in the two to three digit micromolar range (compounds 1g-1m), displayed binding energies between -12.7 kcal/mol to -13.4 kcal/mol.
This stems from additional hydrophobic-type interaction, mainly mediated by π-π interactions with Tyr337 or Trp86, given by the presence of an attached aryl moiety to the basic core of 1.
A similar trend can be found when dealing with in silico results for hBuChE (Table
It is apparent that potent enzyme inhibition is linked to the presence of an aryl appendage attached to 1, which is also reflected by the calculations for 1g-1k (binding energy estimates ≥ -12.8 kcal/mol).
With the exception of 1m, this is due to aryl-aryl interactions mediated between the arylcarbonyl moiety of the ligands and Phe329 (this type of interaction is missing in the case of aliphatic derivatives 1a-1f) and by other less-specific interactions, mostly with catalytic triad residues.
Next, we turned our attention to two of the most pronounced cholinesterase inhibitors, namely 1j and 1m.
The rationale for their selection lies in the fact that 1j was the most active hBuChE and non-specific inhibitor, whereas 1m exerted the highest affinity and selectivity for hAChE.
In accordance with in vitro testing, these ligands were docked into enzyme cavities of human origin.
All 20 poses retrieved from calculation via Autodock Vina software mostly preserved the putative binding modes coined to the catalytic anionic site (CAS) region of both cholinesterases (Table
This applies to both 1j (-13.8 kcal/mol for hAChE and -13.7 kcal/mol for hBuChE) and 1m (-13.4 kcal/mol for hAChE and -11.7 kcal/mol for hBuChE).
As expected, 1j (Figure
The 2-methylbenzoyl moiety is sandwiched between Tyr337 (parallel π-π stacking, 3.7 Å) and Tyr341 (distorted π-π stacking, 3.7 Å).

As expected, 1j (Figure
The 2-methylbenzoyl moiety is sandwiched between Tyr337 (parallel π-π stacking, 3.7 Å) and Tyr341 (distorted π-π stacking, 3.7 Å).
Some π-alkyl interaction can also be observed between Phe338 and the 2-methylbenzoyl moiety.
Linking the carbonyl from the ester group gave rise to a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl from Tyr124 (3.1 Å).
The core of the ligand is located in the proximity of aromatic residues Trp86 and Tyr133 via van der Waal's interaction.
More importantly, His447 enabled the formation of a cation-π bond with a protonated nitrogen from the tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold of 1j (3.7 Å).
Another residue from the catalytic triad, namely Ser203, displayed van der Waal's contact with the polycyclic aliphatic cage of 1j.
Compound 1m (Figure
This structural alteration is plausibly the result of several interactions responsible for the ligand docking, namely i) hydrogen bond formation between the 4-nitro group of the benzoyl moiety and the hydroxyl from Tyr133 (3.0 Å and 2.9 Å), ii) π-π stacking with Tyr341 (3.9 Å) and Phe297 (3.8 Å) in a parallel and T-shaped manner, respectively, iii) CH-π and cation-π forces with Phe338 and iv) parallel π-π interaction between the 4-nitrobenzoyl moiety and Trp86 (3.7 Å).
The catalytic triad in this case remained unaffected; only Ser203 seems to be employed in some non-specific hydrophobic interactions with 1m.
In general, it can be concluded that a major discrepancy in the binding pose is given by the presence of the nitro group in the 4-nitrobenzoyl moiety.
It is noteworthy that both 1j and 1m arranged in completely different binding poses compared with galantamine in the hAChE active site (PDB ID: 4EY6), but still fitted well in the CAS region
This finding could be a promising starting point in terms of designing novel ligands derived from haemanthamine.
Next, we inspected the determinants responsible for the binding differences between 1j-hBuChE (Figure
Similar binding patterns for both ligands can be observed in the hBuChE active site, i.e., i) the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety imposed face-to-face π-π stacking to Trp82 at distances of 3.7 Å and 4.3 Å for 1j and 1m, respectively, ii) a salt bridge between Asp70 (2.2 Å and 2.6 Å for 1j and 1m, respectively) and a protonated nitrogen of the haemanthamine core, as well as iii) a benzoyl moiety residing in the proximity of Phe329 via T-shaped π-π contacts (3.7 Å for both ligands).
The possible explanation of the different affinities of each ligand may be the engagement of the catalytic triad residues in the ligand-enzyme lodging, as well as the overall hydrophobic contribution.
In this regard, all three catalytic triad residues, i.e., Glu197, Ser198 and His438, are affected by 1j, whereas contact with Glu197 is missing in the case of the 1m-hBuChE complex.
On the other hand, the nitro group of 1m provided a conventional hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl from Ser198 (2.9 Å).
As indicated above, other hydrophobic contributors like π-alkyl interaction with Tyr332 presumably provided better fitting in the hBuChE active site.
In this respect, 1j can be considered a more balanced, non-selective cholinesterase inhibitor worthy of further studies.

Experimental

General Experimental Procedures
All solvents were treated by using standard techniques before use.
All reagents and catalysts were purchased from commercial sources (Sigma Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic) and used without purification.
The NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3 and CD3OD at ambient temperature on a VNMR S500 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1 H and 125.7 MHz for 13 C.
Chemical shifts were recorded as δ values in parts per million (ppm) and were indirectly referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) via the solvent signal (CDCl3-7.26
ppm for 1 H and 77.0 ppm for 13 C; CD3OD-3.30
ppm for 1 H and 49.0 ppm for 13 C).

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study
Cell Culture and Culture Conditions Selected human tumor and non-tumor cell lines {Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia), MOLT-4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), A549 (lung carcinoma), HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), PANC-1 (pancreas epithelioid carcinoma), A2780 (ovarian carcinoma), HeLa (cervix adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), SAOS-2 (osteosarcoma) and MRC-5 (normal lung fibroblasts)} were purchased from either ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) or Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and cultured according to the provider's culture method guidelines.
All cell lines were maintained at 37 • C in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air incubator.
Cells in the maximum range of either 10 passages for primary cell line (MRC-5), or in the maximum range of 20 passages for cancer cell lines (Jurkat, MOLT-4, A549, HT-29, PANC-1, A2780, HeLa, MCF-7 and SAOS-2) and in an exponential growth phase were used for this study.

WST-1 Cytotoxicity Assay
The WST-1 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) reagent was used to determine the cytostatic effect of the test compounds.
WST-1 is designed for the spectrophotometric quantification of cell proliferation, growth, viability and chemosensitivity in cell populations using a 96-well-plate format (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
The principle of WST-1 is based on photometric detection of the reduction of tetrazolium salt to a colored formazan product.
The cells were seeded at a previously established optimal density (30,000 Jurkat, 25,000 MOLT-4, 500 A549, 1500 HT-29, 2000 PANC-1, 5000 A2780, 500 HeLa, 1500 MCF-7, 2000 SAOS-2 and 2000 MRC-5 cells/well) in 100 µL of culture medium, and adherent cells were allowed to reattach overnight.
Thereafter, the cells were treated with 100 µL of either corresponding alkaloids or doxorubicin stock solutions to obtain the desired concentrations and incubated in 5% CO 2 at 37 • C. WST-1 reagent diluted 4-fold with PBS (50 µL) was added 48 h after treatment.
Absorbance was measured after 3 h incubation with WST-1 at 440 nm.
The measurements were performed in a Tecan Infinite M200 spectrometer (Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland).
All experiments were performed at least three times with triplicate measurements at each drug concentration per experiment.
The viability was quantified as described previously according to the following formula: (%) viability = (A sample -A blank )/(A control -A blank ) × 100, where A is the absorbance of the employed WST-1 formazan measured at 440 nm
The viability of the treated cells was normalized to the viability of cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) as a vehicle control.

Statistical Analysis
The descriptive statistics of the results were calculated and the charts made in either Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) or GraphPad Prism 5 biostatistics (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
In this study, all of the values were expressed as arithmetic means with SD of triplicates (n = 3), unless otherwise noted.
The significant differences between the groups were analyzed using the Student's t-test and a P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Molecular Modeling Studies

The visualization of enzyme-ligand interactions was prepared using The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 (Schrödinger LLC, Mannheim, Germany).
2D diagrams were created with BIOVIA, Discovery Studio Visualizer, v 17.2.0.16349 (2016) (Dassault Systèmes, San Diego, CA, USA).

Conclusions
In conclusion, twelve derivatives were prepared derived from the β-crinane-type alkaloid haemanthamine.
All semisynthetic derivatives were studied for their inhibitory potential of enzymes connected with AD, and for cytotoxicity.
Using in silico methods, we were able to identify two plausible binding modes for 1j and 1m in hAChE and hBuChE to provide structural insights into the SAR for the two highlighted compounds reported herein.
The potential to penetrate through the BBB of the active derivatives was also studied.
The observations made herein should pave the way for the structure-based optimization of novel haemanthamine analogues potentially applicable in neurodegenerative processes.
Promising biological activities were demonstrated by 1j, 1m and 1g, and these compounds will be used as lead-structures in the development and optimization of more potent drugs for the treatment of AD in the near future.
