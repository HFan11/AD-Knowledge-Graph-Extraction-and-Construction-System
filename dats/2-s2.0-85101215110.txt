CircTulp4 functions in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis by regulating its parental gene, Tulp4
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide-impairs cognition, memory, and language ability and causes dementia.
However, AD pathogenesis remains poorly elucidated.
Recently, a potential link between AD and circular RNAs (circRNAs) has been uncovered, but only a few circRNAs that might be involved in AD have been identified.
Here, we systematically investigated circRNAs in the APP/PS1 model mouse brain through deep RNA-sequencing.
We report that circRNAs are markedly enriched in the brain and that several circRNAs exhibit differential expression between wild-type and APP/PS1 mice.
We characterized one abundant circRNA, circTulp4, derived from Intron1 of the gene Tulp4.
Our results indicate that circTulp4 predominantly localizes in the nucleus and interacts with U1 snRNP and RNA polymerase II to modulate the transcription of its parental gene, Tulp4, and thereby regulate the function of the nervous system and might participate in the development of AD.

Background
Only ~2% of the genes in the human genome encode proteins
Thus, non-protein-coding RNAs such as circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are now under considerable research scrutiny and generally accepted to influence myriad physiological and pathological processes, including the initiation and progression of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)
No effective AD treatments are available, and the genetic basis of AD and the epigenetic control of AD pathogenesis remain largely unelucidated.
CircRNAs are unique among cellular RNAs in that pre-mRNA back-splicing results in covalent linking of the 5ʹ-and 3ʹ-ends
Given this high stability (lifetimes of hours to days or longer), circRNAs could perform functions distinct from those of linear RNAs and also potentially serve as more reliable biomarkers of health and disease than other RNAs.
Intriguingly, in the brain, circRNAs are enriched in neurons and in synaptosomes
For example, CDR1as (CiRS-7: circRNA sponge bound to miR-7) and miR-7 are associated with nervous system development and disease, and CDR1as dysfunction can cause miR-7 upregulation and lead to downregulation of AD-related targets, including ubiquitin-protein ligase A
Furthermore, an SRY-derived circRNA can act as a natural miRNA sponge to inhibit miR-138 activity

However, circRNAs and their activities in AD have not been comprehensively analyzed.
To identify AD-associated circRNAs, we used deep RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) for the first comparative profiling of circRNA expression in the brain of APP/PS1 mice (which express APP 695swe and carry PS1-dE9 mutations) and wild-type (WT) mice.
We used 6-and 9-month-old mice because β-amyloid appears at 6 months and extracellular β-amyloid deposits in the cortex are apparent by 9 months, and synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation are impaired when the mice are 9-12 months old
Our circRNA-profiling data could serve as a useful resource for future development of AD therapeutic targets or novel diagnostics.
Moreover, our findings identify circTulp4 as a potential AD biomarker: circTulp4 is enriched in the brain and downregulated in APP/PS1 mice, and circTulp4 mainly localizes in the nucleus, interacts with U1 snRNP and RNA polymerase II to promote the transcription of its parental gene, Tulp4, and by affecting Tulp4 expression, influences neuronal growth and differentiation.

Results

Brain circRNA profiles differ in WT and APP/PS1 mice
We performed RNA-seq analyses on rRNA-/linear-RNA-depleted total RNA isolated from the brain of 6-/9-month-old WT and APP/PS1 mice; from the final clean reads, we identified 15,713 circRNAs (See Supplementary Data).
The circRNA candidates were annotated using RefSeq database
Most circRNAs were <5000 nt long (median length, 1000 nt; Fig.
We normalized the junction reads (supporting the identification of RNAs as circRNAs) by read length and number of mapped reads (spliced reads per billion mapped reads, denoted as TPM), which permitted quantitative comparisons between junction reads from different RNA-seq data (Fig.
Numerous circRNAs exhibited differential expression across groups, which we quantified using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
In 6-month-old mice, 343 circRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups: 192 and 151 transcripts were significantly (p<0.05)
upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in APP/PS1 mice relative to WT (Fig.
To generate these volcano maps, cluster analysis was performed on the differentially expressed circRNAs.
The brain circRNA profiles of APP/PS1 and WT mice differed (Fig.
We next verified that back-splicing events indicated the genuine circular form of the RNA transcripts and further confirmed the differential expression identified using RNA-seq data.
For this real-time qPCR analysis, we designed divergent primers against 26 circRNAs (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

CircTulp4 is a circRNA that mainly localizes in the nucleus and regulates its parental gene
Our RNA-seq screening identified an array of brain circRNAs showing altered expression in APP/PS1 mice relative to WT.
We now focus on our investigation on one specific circRNA-circTulp4-as a potential AD biomarker.
CircTulp4, derived from Tulp4 Intron1 (Fig.
Our high-throughput sequencing data revealed high circTulp4 levels in the brain, and our qPCR results confirmed significant differential expression of circTulp4 between APP/PS1 and WT mice at both 9 and 12 months (Fig.
To verify that Tulp4 encodes an endogenous circRNA, we designed convergent and divergent primers that amplify canonical or back-spliced forms of Tulp4 RNA (Fig.

PCR after reverse-transcription with the divergent primers (black) generated an
RNase-R-resistant form of circTulp4, whereas the convergent primers (red) generated an RNase-R-sensitive product from linear Tulp4 mRNA (Fig.
Moreover, Sanger sequencing confirmed the junction sequence in circTulp4 (Fig.
We next precisely positioned and quantified circTulp4 by using BaseScope (a novel (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Probe details are listed in Supplementary Data.
BaseScope signals were readily distinguishable as punctate red dots within cells, and circTulp4 expression was markedly lower in 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice than WT mice (Fig.
In FISH analysis performed for cellular localization, a junction-specific probe detected abundant nuclear circTulp4 expression in Neuro-2a cells (Fig.
Because the levels of certain circRNAs (including intron lariats) are positively correlated with those of their parental mRNAs
Thus, when circTulp4 levels were lowered, Tulp4 expression was diminished; however, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tulp4 mRNA did not affect circTulp4 levels (Supplementary Fig.
Conversely, Tulp4 mRNA and protein levels were increased when circTulp4 was overexpressed in cells (Fig.
Collectively, these results suggest that circTulp4 can regulate Tulp4 expression.

CircTulp4 associates with RNA polymerase II by interacting with U1 snRNP
To investigate how circTulp4 regulates Tulp4, we examined circTulp4-protein interactions.
First, we evaluated circTulp4-protein interaction tendency by using CatRAPID, which yields Interaction Strengths indicating likely occurrence (>50%) or high-confidence prediction (>75%) of interaction
Notably, an Interaction Strength of 99% was obtained for circTulp4 interaction with SNRPA (U1 snRNP) (Fig.
We next used RAP assays to directly test circTulp4 interaction with U1 snRNA (Fig.
Because U1 regulatory transcription has been demonstrated
Because U1 and U2 are generally in close proximity and frequently function together to form a splicing body, we checked for U2 capture.
We selected 7SK and CDR1as because 7SK has been reported to function in regulating transcription
Lastly, U6 and U7, which are distant from U1, were used as negative controls.
The circTulp4-specific probe captured considerably more circTulp4 relative to the control probe, and U1 was pulled down to a markedly higher level than other RNAs (Fig.
Notably, U1 snRNA also colocalized with circTulp4 (detected using a junction probe) in two cell types (Fig.
These results suggest that circTulp4 can bind to U1 snRNA.
Because U1 interacts with RNA polymerase II to regulate transcription
In RIP assays performed using antibodies against U1 (U1A and SNRNP70), RNA polymerase II, and

This provides complementary evidence that these molecules interact and thus might function together.
We also investigated potential interactions between circTulp4, U1 snRNA, and Tulp4; we checked for RNA capture by performing ChIRP assays, which revealed that pull-down with the circTulp4 probe captured U1 snRNA (Fig.
U2 snRNA was also pulled down with circTulp4, although this association might be indirect.
These results verified the RAP results and demonstrated circTulp4 association with U1 snRNA.

CircTulp4 recruits U1 snRNP to regulate Tulp4 transcription
We divided the 3000-bp Tulp4 promotor (3000 bp upstream of coding area) into 6 segments (A-F) and designed a primer for almost every 500-bp stretch.
We found that circTulp4 associates with segments E and F, located ~500 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of Tulp4 (Fig.

RPL30 was the positive-control primer, and chromatin was ultrasonically broken into 200-500-bp fragments (Supplementary Fig.
Segments E and F showed marked enrichment, which indicated that the U1A-binding site was located in these segments, and U1A but not U2AF65 interacted with the Tulp4 promoter region (Fig.
These findings suggest that circTulp4, U1 snRNP, and RNA polymerase II potentially interact with each other at the promoter region of Tulp4.

CircTulp4 affects Tulp4 expression and thereby regulates neuronal differentiation, cell viability, and neurite growth and branching
To complete our current evaluation of circTulp4 as a potential AD biomarker, we examined circTulp4 neuronal expression and function.
First, qPCR results demonstrated circTulp4 expression in brain tissue from 2-12-month-old APP/PS1 and WT mice, and in accord with the RNA-seq results, circTulp4 expression in the brain was lower in APP/PS1 than WT mice at both 9 and 12 months (Fig.
Moreover, in agreement with a previous study

circTulp4 was upregulated during neuronal differentiation in different cell types (Fig.
To investigate circTulp4 function in neuronal cells, circTulp4 expression was silenced using junction-sequence-targeting siRNAs; these siRNAs, but not a control siRNA, markedly lowered circTulp4 levels in two cell types (Supplementary Fig.
Moreover, circTulp4 downregulation significantly decreased neurite growth and branching in hippocampal neurons and cell lines (Fig.
These findings suggest that circTulp4 functions in neuronal growth and development.
Notably, Tulp4 exhibited the same expression pattern as circTulp4 in mouse brain tissue (Fig.
The finding that circTulp4 knockdown affected Tulp4 expression suggested that Tulp4 plays a role in the effects observed following circTulp4 knockdown.
Accordingly, siRNA-mediated Tulp4 downregulation markedly diminished neuronal viability (Fig.
And the subsequent rescue experiment can be found that when knocking down circTulp4 and overexpressing the parent gene Tulp4 at the same time, it has a significant rescue effect on cell viability and neurite damage (Fig.
These findings collectively suggest that circTulp4 could influence normal neuronal growth and development by regulating Tulp4 expression; we propose that this circTulp4 regulatory function underlies the potential link between circTulp4 dysregulation and AD pathogenesis.

The obtained interaction propensity is a measure of the interaction probability between 1 protein (or region) and 1 RNA (or region).
This measure is based on the observed tendency of ribonucleoprotein-complex components to exhibit specific physicochemical properties that can be used to make a prediction.
Interaction Strength, a statistical measure for evaluating interaction propensity with respect to CatRAPID training, reflects prediction confidence, ranging from 0% (unpredictability) to 100% (predictability): values of >50% indicate that an interaction is likely to occur, values of >75% represent high-confidence predictions

Discussion
No effective AD treatment is currently available, and therapies targeting the main AD neuropathological hallmarks (β-amyloid aggregates, neurofibrillary tangles) have shown little success
Thus, epigenetic regulation of AD pathogenesis has recently been widely studied to identify potential new biomarkers/therapeutic targets.
Intriguingly, dynamic changes in DNA methylation and long noncoding RNAs in the brain are reported to contribute to AD
However, potential circRNA functions in AD development/progression remain largely unknown.
RNA-seq analyses
Thousands of circRNAs are highly expressed in the mammalian brain, accumulated in neural tissues during aging, conserved between rodents and humans, and more abundant than linear RNAs in neuronal synaptic fractions
Thus, circRNAs could perform critical functions in the nervous system, and circRNA dysregulation might underlie neurodegenerative disease development/progression. Accordingly, Lukiw
However, our study represents the first comprehensive circRNA profiling in the brain in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD.
We compared brain circRNA profiles between age-matched APP/PS1 and WT mice and identified several circRNAs showing altered expression in APP/PS1 mice.
Moreover, we found marked circTulp4 downregulation in the brain in 9-/12-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which suggests a potential association of circTulp4 dysregulation with AD pathogenesis.
CircRNA functions have been extensively studied but remain incompletely understood.

Certain circRNAs could function as miRNA sponges, but only a few circRNAs contain multiple binding sites for trapping specific miRNAs
Interestingly, circRNA knockdown can cause diminished parental-gene expression, which supports the possibility that certain circRNAs upregulate RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of parental genes
Our findings suggest that circTulp4 is one such circRNA: circTulp4 predominantly localizes in the nucleus and interacts with U1 snRNP and RNA polymerase II to promote Tulp4 transcription.
This ability to control Tulp4 expression might allow circTulp4 to regulate nervous system functions and thereby influence AD development.
We propose (Fig.

CircTulp4 might form a complex with U1 snRNA through specific RNA-RNA interaction, and the circTulp4-U1 snRNP complex might further interact with the Pol II transcription complex at Tulp4 promoter to modulate Tulp4 expression and, thereby, regulate neuronal differentiation and nervous system functions and participate in AD development.
Tulp4 is a protein of the tubby family, which is associated with neuronal differentiation and development, and tubby-protein mutations are implicated in obesity, deafness, and visual impairment

However, very few studies have been published on Tulp4.
This is the first report that Tulp4 can critically affect nerve-cell differentiation and thus potentially contribute to nervous system growth and development.
In conclusion, several brain-enriched circRNAs are differently expressed between WT and APP/PS1 mice; our RNA-seq database of these circRNAs could serve as a valuable resource for future investigations into circRNA involvement in AD development and suitability as AD pathogenesis biomarkers.
Moreover, circTulp4 is downregulated in APP/PS1 mice, and circTulp4 localizes in the nucleus, interacts with U1 snRNP and RNA polymerase II, and promotes Tulp4 transcription.
The circTulp4 ability to control Tulp4 expression might enable circTulp4 to regulate neuronal differentiation and thereby influence nervous system functions and AD development.
Certain circRNAs are stably detected in body fluids (e.g., plasma), which allows their use as biomarkers or therapeutic targets
Therefore, we will next test for stable circTulp4 detection in body fluids and determine whether circTulp4 expression correlates with specific clinical stages of AD.

Conclusion
In conclusion, CircTulp4-a circRNA downregulated in APP/PS1 mice-localized in the nucleus and interacted with U1 snRNP and RNA polymerase II to regulate the transcription of its parental gene, Tulp4.
CircTulp4 and Tulp4 showed similar expression in brain tissues, and downregulation suppressed neuronal survival/growth and branching.
circTulp4 maight influence nervous system functions and might participate in the development of AD.

CA, USA) based on the multiplex fluorescent ISH RNAscope® method (Advanced Cell Diagnostics [47]).
ISH methods are highly specific and sensitive due to the use of a unique probe design employing "ZZ" probe pairs and signal amplification, respectively.
Advances in signal amplification over RNAscope® have enabled the use in BaseScope assays of a single-pair probe, comprising a pair of 18-25-bp oligonucleotides, for detecting junction sequences.
Table S1 lists the targeted sequences of our customized junction-specific circTulp4 ISH probes.
BaseScope ISH assays were performed on 20-μm-thick, fresh-frozen brain-tissue sections from 6-/9-month-old WT and APP/PS1 mice.
Sections were deparaffinized in xylene, treated with H 2 O 2 (10 min, room temperature) to block endogenous peroxidases,
