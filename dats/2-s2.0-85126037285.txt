Activation of the Nrf2 Pathway Prevents Mitochondrial Dysfunction Induced by Caspase-3 Cleaved Tau: Implications for Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by memory and cognitive impairment, accompanied by the accumulation of extracellular deposits of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of pathological forms of tau protein.
Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are also critical elements for AD development.
We previously showed that the presence of caspase-3 cleaved tau, a relevant pathological form of tau in AD, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage in different neuronal models.
Recent studies demonstrated that the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) plays a significant role in the antioxidant response promoting neuroprotection.
Here, we studied the effects of Nrf2 activation using sulforaphane (SFN) against mitochondrial injury induced by caspase-3 cleaved tau.
We used immortalized cortical neurons to evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetics and ROS levels in control and SFN-treated cells.
Expression of caspase-3 cleaved tau induced mitochondrial fragmentation, depolarization, ATP loss, and increased ROS levels.
Treatment with SFN for 24 h significantly prevented these mitochondrial abnormalities, and reduced ROS levels.
Analysis of Western blots and rt-PCR studies showed that SFN treatment increased the expression of several Nrf2-related antioxidants genes in caspase-3 cleaved tau cells.
These results indicate a potential role of the Nrf2 pathway in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction induced by pathological forms of tau in AD.

Introduction
AD is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide.
AD is a progressive disorder that causes cognitive defects and behavioral changes, where the earliest symptoms are memory impairment that progresses gradually into severe dementia
AD is characterized by the accumulation of Aβ and NFTs composed of pathological forms of tau, including hyperphosphorylated and truncated types
Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that contributes to axonal transport, synaptic function, and microtubule stability.
The cleavage of tau at D421 by caspase-3 (truncation) is an important contributor to NFTs formation and neurodegenerative changes observed in AD
In particular, tau truncation by caspase-3 (D421) is present in AD brains
Thus, nowadays, AD is considered a multifactorial disease in which mitochondrial dysfunction actively contributes to AD onset and progression.
These mitochondrial abnormalities include bioenergetics defects, mitochondrial respiratory impairment, oxidative damage, and defects in mitochondrial dynamics that contribute to synaptic dysfunction observed in AD
Importantly, we have demonstrated that the expression of caspase-3 cleaved tau in neuronal cell lines and primary neurons negatively affects mitochondrial health in response to calcium stress and Aβ treatment
Furthermore, mitochondrial impairment induced by pathological modifications of tau can also affect neuronal communication
Moreover, the expression of caspase-3 cleaved tau affected mitochondrial health-inducing depolarization and mitochondrial fragmentation by impairing the mitochondrial fusion regulator Opa1
Finally, the expression of this cleaved tau form reduced mitochondrial transport in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that these actions could be relevant to the synaptic deficiency observed in AD
Since mitochondria are vulnerable to oxidative damage induced by an uncontrolled ROS increase, endogenous antioxidant defense systems could play an essential role in cell survival under physiological and pathological conditions
Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that maintains redox homeostasis by regulating antioxidant-response element (ARE)-dependent transcription and the expression of antioxidant defense enzymes
Since Nrf2 activates the antioxidant systems in response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 signaling is one of the primary systems counteracting mitochondrial-derived ROS production
Nrf2-dependent antioxidant strategies include the increase of mitochondrial thiol redox systems, such as the mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) system and thioredoxin (TRX)
Mitochondrial GSH is made in the cytosol, and then transported to the mitochondrial matrix by GSH peroxidases 1 and 4, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and glutaredoxin-2 to prevent the increase of ROS
The mitochondrial TRX system consists of TRX2 and TRX reductase 2 (TRXR2), which maintains TRX2 in a reduced state by using mitochondrial NADPH as a substrate
In addition, TRX2 maintains the activities of the peroxidase Peroxiredoxin 3 and methionine sulfoxide reductases, while also directly reducing protein disulfides
More interestingly, studies in a drosophila model of human tauopathy (Tau R406W) showed a reduction in TRX and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression, which promoted Tau-induced neurodegeneration and neuronal apoptosis
Complementary studies showed that AD brains presented a decrease in neuronal TRX1 and glutathione (GRX) expression
Furthermore, Aβ neurotoxicity might be mediated by the oxidation of TRX-1 and subsequent activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) cascade
These studies suggest that the deregulation of the GRX and TRX antioxidants system may contribute to AD pathogenesis
Several reports have demonstrated the use of sulforaphane (SFN), an organic isothiocyanate compound found in cruciferous vegetables, including cauliflower, brussels sprouts, broccoli, white cabbage, and red cabbage, as a potent activator of the Nrf2 pathway in the SNC
SFN, through Nrf2 pathway activation, can modulate diverse pathways in neuronal cells
For example, SFN showed increasing tau
These effects against pathological forms of tau can also be observed in 3×Tg-AD mice
In the present study, we investigated the effect of Nrf2 activation and its downstream genes on mitochondrial dysfunction induced by the presence of caspase-3 cleaved tau in cortical neurons.
Treatment with SFN prevented mitochondrial abnormalities and ROS increase induced by the expression of caspase-3 cleaved tau.
Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by an increase in the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes, suggesting this pathway's potential role in the prevention of mitochondrial failure induced by truncated tau.
Therefore, Nrf2 could be considered a prominent player in the protection of the structural and functional integrity of the mitochondria in the brain.

Materials and Methods

Cell Culture
Conditionally immortalized cortical neurons (CN1.4)
In addition, these cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing GFP, GFP-full-length tau (GFP-T4), and GFP-caspase-3 cleaved tau (GFP-T4C3), and after 48 h, transfected cells were treated with 10 µm of SFN (ChemCruz, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) for 24 h.

Tau Constructs
Tau constructs tagged with GFP, GFP-full-length tau (GFP-T4), and GFP-caspase-3 cleaved tau (GFP-T4C3) were generated as previously described
In addition, CN1.4 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing tau constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted in OptiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
Cells media were changed 24 h post-transfection, and analyses were conducted 48 h post-transfection.
GFP and tau expression was verified with live-cell imaging, observing a 40% transfection efficiency in CN 1.4.
Moreover, GFP, GFP-T4, and GFP-T4C3 expression levels were estimated by detecting GFP expression using Western blot.

Determination of Mitochondrial Length and Membrane Potential in Live Cells
The mitochondrial length was evaluated in CN 1.4 cells double transfected by GFP and GFP-tau (s) forms and Mito-mCherry construct
The mitochondrial length was obtained by measuring the lengths of individual mitochondria present in fluorescence images, which were obtained using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
We analyzed the mitochondrial population of 40-60 cells, measuring 25 images for each experiment using ImageJ software for analysis
The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels were evaluated using the mitochondrial Mitotracker Red 2XRosH 2 (MitoRed) dye in CN 1.4 cells
Transfected cells were loaded with MitoRed in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer (136 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose; pH = 7.4) for 35 min, and then fluorescence images were taken.
Fluorescence intensity was captured using a fluorescence microscope LX6000 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) under a 63×oil objective.
We analyzed 30-40 cells on average for the quantification process, measuring at least 25 images for each experiment.
Mitochondrial potential levels are presented as the pseudo ratio (∆F/F0), where F is the average of the fluorescence signal (F) per area in every image, and (F0) represents the intensity of background fluorescence

Determination of ROS Levels
ROS levels were evaluated using CellRox TM dye (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
Transfected cultured cells were incubated with 0.5 µM CellRox in KRH-glucose buffer at 37 • C for 30 min
Fluorescence images were acquired using the same exposure time and gain to minimize dye photo-bleaching
CellRox fluorescence (F) was determined in each cell, and each image's background (F0) was subtracted before normalization per cell area.
Normalization was performed to ameliorate differences in the dye distribution inside the cells that present differences in cellular morphology.
Fluorescence images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Leica LX6000, Wetzlar, Germany).

Western Blot Analysis
CN1.4 cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer, including a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and a phosphatase inhibitor (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA)
Total protein extracts (30 µg) were separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel, and subsequently transferred onto PVDF membranes.
After blocking in 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the membranes were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-Nrf2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), mouse monoclonal Catalase (1:1000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), mouse monoclonal HO-1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), and mouse monoclonal NQO-1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) antibodies.
To test the equal protein loading, the membranes were subsequently re-tested with anti-actin (1:3000; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) antibody, as indicated.
Primary antibody signal was determined by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:3000; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and protein expressions were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).
Expression levels of the indicated proteins were estimated related to the intensity of housekeeping protein signals using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Results

Activation of the Nrf2 Pathway Prevent Mitochondrial Dysfunction Induced by Caspase-3 Cleaved Tau
Immortalized cortical neurons were co-transfected with Mito-mCherry to examine mitochondrial morphology in situ, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential levels (Figure
We previously showed that truncated tau expression reduced mitochondrial length and mitochondrial membrane potential levels (MMP)
Here, we observed that GFP-T4C3 presented a reduced mitochondrial length than GFP and GFP-T4 cells (Figure
GFP and GFP-T4 present a uniform mitochondrial morphology distributed throughout the whole cell body (Figure
However, GFP-T4C3 cells showed more rounded and fragmented mitochondria (Figure
Quantification analysis shows that GFP-T4C3 cells present a decrease of two-fold in mitochondrial length, compared with GFP or GFP-T4 cells (Figure
Interestingly, when GFP-T4C3 cells were treated for 24 h with 10 µM of SFN, the mitochondrial fragmentation was prevented entirely, reaching similar values of mitochondrial length of GFP and GFP-T4 cells (Figure
For mitochondrial membrane potential determinations, GFP and GFP-tau (s) transfected cells were loaded with MitoRed, and treated with 0.5 µM thapsigargin (25 min) to induce a transient cytosolic calcium increase to test mitochondrial function
Therefore, MitoRed fluorescence intensity levels were obtained from live-cell images taken in a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany).
Mitochondrial potential levels were severely affected in GFP-T4C3 cells, reaching a more than four-fold decrease compared with GFP or GFP-T4 transfected cells.
More importantly, GFP-T4C3 treated with SFN showed prevention of mitochondrial depolarization reaching similar mitochondrial potential levels to GFP and GFP-T4 cells (Figure
These studies suggest that SFN prevents mitochondrial impairment induced by caspase-3 cleaved tau.

Activation of the Nrf2 Pathway Improves Mitochondrial Health by Rescuing ATP Production Loss Induced by Caspase-3 Cleaved Tau
Due to their high activity and signaling, neuronal cells require a constant energy supply, which makes them particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction
Decreased ATP production is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, and can be caused by various mechanisms, including the impaired activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, alterations in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle or uncoupling
To further understand how the presence of caspase-3 cleaved tau affected mitochondrial functions, we measured ATP production in immortalized cortical neurons that expressed GFP, GFP-T4, and GFP-T4C3 (Figure
The expression of GFP-T4C3 presented a significant decrease in basal ATP levels compared to GFP and GFP-T4 expressing cells (Figure
Furthermore, we treated transfected cells with 0.5 µM of thapsigargin, and we observed that ATP production was markedly decreased, reaching similar values in all these three conditions (Figure
Significantly, when cells were treated for 24 h with 10 µM SFN, the loss in ATP production was restored in GFP-T4C3 cells treated with thapsigargin (Figure

Sulforaphane Prevented ROS Increase Induced by Caspase-3 Cleaved Tau Expression
Complementary to mitochondrial function determinations, we analyzed ROS production levels in cells transfected with GFP, GFP-T4, and GFP-T4C3 using Cell Rox dye (Figure
We observed that the expression of caspase-3 cleaved tau significantly increased basal ROS levels compared with GFP and GFP-T4 cells (Figure
Moreover, transfected cells treated with thapsigargin (0.5 µM, 30 min) showed an increase in ROS levels; however, under this condition, GFP-T4C3 cells showed a more significant increase in Cell Rox signal compared to GFP and GFP-T4 cells (Figure
Interestingly, ROS increase in GFP-T4C3 cells showed a fluorescence pattern similar to mitochondrial localization, indicating an essential role of this organelle in this effect (Figure
Significantly, SFN completely reduced ROS-increased levels in cells expressing caspase-3 cleaved tau (GFP-T4C3), compared with ROS levels shown in control or full-length tau cells (Figure
These studies suggest that incubation with SFN prevented the excess ROS production present in GFP-T4C3 cells, facilitating the protection of mitochondrial function, as observed by the normalization of ROS levels.

Treatment with SFN Induces Activation of the Nrf2 Pathway in Immortalized Cortical Neurons
To verify the activation of the Nrf2 pathway by SFN, we performed rt-PCR and analyzed the mRNA expression of central antioxidant response genes activated by Nrf2 in GFP, GFP-T4, and GFP-T4C3 cells (Figure
Under basal conditions, the mRNA levels of Nrf2 in the GFP condition and the presence of caspase-3 cleaved tau remained relatively similar, except for GFP-T4 cells, where lower levels of mRNA expression were observed (Figure
As a part of this Nrf2 activation mechanism, SFN modifies Keap1 cysteine residues, functioning as sensors for numerous oxidants and electrophiles, leading to Nrf2 activation
Notably, when the cells were treated with SFN (10 µM, 24 h), Nrf2 expression was significantly increased in all three conditions (Figure
To further analyze the Nrf2 pathway, we evaluated the mRNA levels of the KEAP1, the negative regulator of the Nrf2 pathway (Figure
When cells were exposed to SFN, a mild increase in the KEAP1 expression in GFP and GFP-T4 cells was shown.
Moreover, caspase-3 cleaved tau cells exposed to SFN presented KEAP1 mRNA levels similar to the control condition.
Furthermore, we analyze the expression of primary Nrf2-ARE dependent genes, including NQO1, HO-1, Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCS), glutathione-disulfide reductase (GR1), and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRxR 1),
The analysis of NQO1, a cytosolic flavoprotein that catalyzes quinine detoxification, showed that its basal expression was diminished in GFP, GFP-T4, and GFP-T4C3 expressing cells (Figure
On the other hand, the treatment with SFN induced a marked increase in this gene expression, reaching an increase of more than three-fold in the GFP and GFP-T4C3 expressing cells (Figure
Although, this increase was lower in GFP-T4 cells than in control, maintaining a similar tendency in the expression of Nrf2.
In addition, we evaluated HO-1 levels (Figure
Further analysis of GCS and GR1 mRNA levels showed that SFN treatment increased GCS and GR1 levels in GFP, GFP-T4, and GFP-T4C3 cells (Figure
Finally, we evaluated the levels of the mammalian selenoprotein, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRxR 1) (Figure
Intriguingly, GFP-T4C3 cells showed a higher basal expression in TRxR 1 levels than GFP and GFP-T4 cells.
Moreover, SFN treatment increased TRxR1 in all conditions indicated.
However, this increase was higher in cells that expressed GFP-T4C3 (Figure
These results indicate that SFN induces the expression of antioxidant genes dependent on Nrf2 activity in immortalized cortical neurons.
These events could be related to the prevention of ROS increase and mitochondrial impairment induced by the treatment with SFN in GFP-T4C3 cells.

Nrf2 Pathway Activation Increase the Antioxidant Protein Expression
Complementarily, we checked protein expression levels of several antioxidant proteins regulated by the Nrf2 pathway
As we previously observed for mRNA levels, under basal conditions, Nrf2 protein levels remained similar in the GFP and GFP-T4 cells, while a lower decrease in Nrf2 expression was observed in GFP-T4C3 cells.
After the treatment with SFN (10 µm, 24 h), Nrf2 expression was significantly increased in all cell conditions indicated (control, full-length, and caspase-3 cleaved tau).
NQO-1 expression in cortical neurons showed similar results, with lower levels in the control conditions and higher expression when they were treated with SFN.
Moreover, we measured catalase levels, whose expression is also related to Nrf2 activity
Catalase is one of the crucial antioxidant enzymes that mitigates oxidative stress to a considerable extent by converting hydrogen peroxide to produce water and oxygen
Under control conditions, GFP, full-length, and caspase-3 cleaved tau expressing cells showed relatively similar protein expression, and SFN treatment significantly increased catalase levels in all three conditions.

Discussion
This study aimed to elucidate the possible role of the Nrf2 pathway on mitochondrial impairment induced by caspase-3 cleaved in neuronal cells.
Nrf2 plays a central role in the cytoprotective response to oxidative stress and is critical for maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis
Here, we reported that, in cells expressing truncated tau, mitochondria presented a fragmented morphology and higher levels of ROS and mitochondrial depolarization
These observations indicate that truncated tau impairs mitochondrial function, which likely contributes to the neuronal dysfunction observed in AD.
Interestingly, SFN treatment, a natural activator of Nrf2, prevented mitochondrial fragmentation in caspase-3 cleaved tau expressing cells (Figure
In addition, mitochondrial depolarization presented in GFP-T4C3 cells was prevented by the treatment with SFN (Figure
Moreover, the treatment with SFN for 24 h prevented ROS production in truncated tau-expressing cells, suggesting that Nrf2 activation improves mitochondrial health.
Related to our findings, Kovac and colleagues showed that mitochondrial-ROS production is increased in brain tissue of Nrf2-KO mice
They also demonstrated that Nrf2 impacts cellular bioenergetics by controlling substrate availability and the efficiency of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, thus affecting oxidative phosphorylation and increasing mitochondrial-ROS production
Here, we observed that caspase-3 cleaved tau induces a decrease in ATP production, which correlates with mitochondrial depolarization shown in truncated tau expressing cells (Figure
In the same context, Holmström et al. observed an impaired activity of complex I of the respiratory chain under conditions of Nrf2 deficiency in neuronal cells of Nrf2-knockout mice
Furthermore, Nrf2 deficiency leads to mitochondrial depolarization, reduced ATP levels, and impaired respiration
On the other hand, other studies showed that basal MMP was increased when Nrf2 was genetically activated by knockout or knockdown of Keap1 protein, indicating that Nrf2 could regulate mitochondrial activity.
Furthermore, the Nrf2 pathway contributes to mitochondrial function by modulating NADH and FADH2, both of which are important substrates for mitochondrial respiration
Interesting studies have suggested an essential role of the Nrf2 pathway in promoting mitochondrial integrity under oxidative conditions
For example, the isolated brain of rats that were subjected to a single dose of the Nrf2 activator SFN showed resistance to opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) caused by the oxidant tertbutyl hydroperoxide
The formation and opening of the mPTP is a fundamental factor in mitochondrial dysfunction, and this action can induce mitochondrial depolarization, decrease ATP production, release mitochondrial contents, and lead to cell death
Interestingly, some studies suggest an important action of the Nrf2 pathway modulating mPTP opening induced by oxidative stress
For example, Greco and coworkers observed a slight inhibition of peroxide-induced mPTP opening in mitochondria isolated from the brains of normal rats injected with SFN
Furthermore, additional studies from Greco et al. demonstrated that SFN administration to rats dramatically inhibits redox-regulated mPTP opening by liver mitochondria, and increases immunoreactive levels of mitochondrial antioxidant-related proteins
More importantly, we previously described that the use of mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) was influential in preventing mitochondrial fragmentation, decrease in MMP, and mitochondrial calcium handling defects showed in neuronal cells that expressed caspase-3 cleaved tau
However, further studies are needed to elucidate if the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Nrf2 is produced by mPTP regulation in caspase-3 cleaved tau expressing cells.
Emerging evidence demonstrates that the accumulation of phosphorylated and oligomerized tau is a toxic event that affects neuronal function
In this context, evidence obtained by Jo et al. showed that activating the Nrf2 pathway with SFN reduced the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau by inducing the expression of autophagy adapter protein NDP52 in neurons
The NDP52 protein presents three ARE in its promoter region, and its expression is strongly induced by Nrf2 activation, facilitating the elimination of hyperphosphorylated tau to the autophagic degradative pathway
Although we did not observe these effects in caspase-3 cleaved tau cells treated with SFN (Figure
Finally, our results showed that treating cortical neurons with SFN increased the Nrf2-ARE-dependent genes expression in all conditions indicated (Figure
Interestingly, we detected a significant increase in mRNA TRX1 expression in caspase-3 cleaved tau cells, compared with GFP-T4 cells (Figure
TRX1 is a critical enzyme that regulates several processes involved in decreasing oxidative stress-reducing intracellular disulfides and upholding the redox homeostasis within the cell
Previous findings have shown that TRX1 levels were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients
Moreover, the immunohistochemical studies of TRX1 revealed that only cytosolic localization was observed in the hippocampus CA1 of AD patients, whereas TRX1 in the control patients was observed in the nucleus, with no difference in the expressing levels between control and AD patients
These observations suggest that the translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol may diminish this reduction and, ultimately, the function of critical signaling molecules and transcription factors regulated by TRX1
Notably, under the effect of SFN, NQO-1, GCS, and GR1 levels were elevated in full-length and caspase-3 cleaved tau expressing cells, indicating activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway.
Furthermore, previous findings reported a significant increase in HO-1 expression in the post-mortem brain of AD temporal cortex and hippocampus compared to agedmatched control
Moreover, an increase in NQO1 activity and expression was found in astrocytes and neurons of the AD brain
Additionally, studies in aged APP/PS1 AD mouse models showed a reduction in Nrf2, NQO1, GCL catalytic subunit (GCLC), and GCL modifier subunit (GCLM) mRNA levels
These studies indicate that Nrf2-related genes contribute to neurodegeneration in AD, and they may be responsible for mitochondrial impairment observed during this disease.
Our findings presented here indicate the importance of the Nrf2 pathway in reducing mitochondrial and oxidative damage induced by pathological forms of tau.
Furthermore, it is essential to understand the mechanism underlying the protection induced by Nrf2dependent genes, and to elucidate other protective effects on mitochondrial function and the consequences of this protection on neuronal dysfunction in AD.
