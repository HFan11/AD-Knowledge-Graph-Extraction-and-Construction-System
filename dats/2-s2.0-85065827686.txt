The Brain NGF Metabolic Pathway in Health and in Alzheimerâ€™s Pathology
Emerging research has re-emphasized the role of the cortical cholinergic system in the symptomology and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic nuclei depend on target-derived NGF for survival during development and for the maintenance of a classical cholinergic phenotype during adulthood.
In AD, BF cholinergic neurons lose their cholinergic phenotype and function, suggesting an impairment in NGF-mediated trophic support.
We propose that alterations to the enzymatic pathway that controls the maturation of proNGF to mature NGF and the latter's ulterior degradation underlie this pathological process.
Indeed, the NGF metabolic pathway has been demonstrated to be impaired in AD and other amyloid pathologies, and pharmacological manipulation of NGF metabolism has consequences in vivo for both levels of proNGF/NGF and the phenotype of BF cholinergic neurons.
The NGF pathway may also have potential as a biomarker of cognitive decline in AD, as its changes can predict future cognitive decline in patients with Down syndrome as they develop preclinical Alzheimer's pathology.
New evidence suggests that the cholinergic system, and by extension NGF, may have a greater role in the progression of AD than previously realized, as changes to the BF precede and predict changes to the entorhinal cortex, as anticholinergic drugs increase odds of developing AD, and as the use of donepezil can reduce rates of hippocampal and cortical thinning.
These findings suggest that new, more sophisticated cholinergic therapies should be capable of preserving the basal forebrain thus having profound positive effects as treatments for AD.

INTRODUCTION
The extraordinary discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) by Rita Levi Montalcini and Stan Cohen, under the umbrella of Victor Hamburger's laboratory
This family plays a very significant role in the development and function of peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) neurons, and critically, some trophic mechanisms appear altered in neurodegenerative conditions.
This brief review focuses on the significance of NGF for the maintenance of the cholinergic phenotype in the mature and fully differentiated CNS.
It discusses the existence of a metabolic pathway explaining the release of the NGF precursor molecule and its maturation and degradation in the extracellular space.
Furthermore, we discuss the compromise of this pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD), explaining the well-established atrophy of NGF-dependent cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (BF), and the possibility of deriving accessible biomarkers of AD in preclinical stages based on the NGF metabolic deregulation.
Lastly, we discuss possible therapeutic interventions to normalize the NGF metabolism in AD, thus protecting the viability of the cortical and hippocampal "cholinergic tone."

NGF IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE CHOLINERGIC PHENOTYPE
Nerve growth factor has been clearly implicated in the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) in development
In adulthood the presence of NGF is essential for the maintenance of the BFCN phenotype
The first evidence for NGF-reparative effects in the adult CNS came from studies applying axotomy of the fimbria fornix projection to deprive BFCN of target-derived NGF, which led to an apparent neuronal loss of cholinergic neurons of the medial septum
In 1982, Whitehouse and collaborators proposed that the cortical cholinergic biochemical depletion in AD was due to the loss of magnocellular (presumed cholinergic) neurons of the nucleus basalis, based on Nissl studies in which only the large (magnocellular) neurons were counted
Later assessments of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity in rodents demonstrated that large cortical stroke lesions, which eliminated cholinergic nerve terminals, resulted not in cell loss but rather in a loss of size and cholinergic character of the cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis
Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a similar atrophy of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, rather than cell loss, was observed in the human nucleus basalis of Meynert in AD
These observations led us to propose that in AD, the primary pathology results in a secondary retrograde atrophy of cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis
The most definitive experimental evidence for neuronal atrophy following NGF deprivation came from the excitotoxic elimination of NGF-producing neurons in the hippocampus, sparing cholinergic nerve terminals but nonetheless inducing a similar atrophy of NGF-dependent neurons of the BF
A number of thorough experimental studies confirmed the ability of exogenous NGF (both recombinant and isolated from the maxillary gland) to support NGF-dependent cholinergic nuclei of the BF (nucleus basalis and medial septum) following their disconnection from the sites of NGF production
Importantly, it was demonstrated that exogenous NGF could elicit a compensatory de novo cholinergic synaptogenesis in the remaining nonlesioned cortical tissue in the mature and fully differentiated CNS
Our lab introduced the concept that the day-to-day expression of endogenous mNGF regulates the steady-state number of cortical cholinergic synapses
This is in line with the classical Hebbian notion that synaptic growth is a brain activity-dependent phenomenon
Indeed, altering the availability of endogenous NGF by pharmacologically blocking its conversion from proNGF to mNGF or by preventing its degradation does lead to notable changes in the density of cortical cholinergic terminals
The transcription of major cholinergic markers has been shown to be dependent on the signaling of the NGF ligand through the NGF receptor TrkA; this includes the expression of TrkA itself
In vitro experiments have shown that the ability of NGF to upregulate ChAT expression in BFCNs is enhanced by administration of gangliosides
Lastly, the extent of dendritic arbors, axon length, and the characteristic multipolarity of BF cholinergic cells have all been shown to be dependent on NGF
Central to this process seems to be the homeobox transcription factor LIM homeobox 8, or Lhx8, the expression of which is essential for the development of BFCN
Lhx8 directly controls the expression of TrkA, is essential for normal release of acetylcholine, and is induced by NGF signaling through the ERK pathway
As ChAT and VAChT are downstream of TrkA, Lhx8 may function as a NGF-responsive master regulator of cholinergic character, both in development and in the adult organism.

POSSIBLE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF EXOGENOUS NGF
As discussed above, there is abundant experimental literature supporting the ability of "exogenous" mNGF to recover atrophic BFCN in rodent lesion models as well as in non-human primates.
Such strong experimental evidence provoked a number of clinical attempts to apply exogenous mNGF in the cerebroventricular space of AD patients
Most recently, attempts to apply NGF therapeutically in the context of AD have employed gene therapy to overexpress the NGF gene
These have achieved some success, demonstrating, variously, increases in BFCN arborization, cortical glucose metabolism, and nicotinic binding as well as normalization of cholinergic markers in the CSF, and inconsistent reports of reductions in cognitive decline
Ultimately, the gene therapy approach was discontinued after a Phase 2 study which, though well tolerated, demonstrated no effect on cognitive outcomes
While these approaches show great promise, the application of exogenous NGF will inevitably entail the risk of offtarget effects.
Trophic NGF signaling is tightly constrained both in space (synaptic compartmentalization) and in time (activity dependence).
NGF applied outside these parameters will not necessarily have the desired effect.
Furthermore, any interruptions in NGF trafficking or excessive degradation of NGF in AD would not necessarily be overcome by exogenous application.
An ideal approach would be to rather enhance the availability of endogenous NGF specifically at its physiological sites of synthesis, release, and signaling.

ATROPHY OF BFCNs IN AD AND ITS CAUSES AND THE NGF PARADOX
It is well established that BFCN are highly vulnerable to AD pathology, as they are observed in greatly reduced numbers at clinical presentation
As discussed above, these neurons were initially presumed to have died
The nucleus basalis of Meynert may be preferentially vulnerable compared to the medial septum and diagonal band
The atrophy of the BFCN in AD correlates to disease duration
These findings, in combination with the downregulation of cholinergic markers in AD and the amnesic effects of anticholinergic compounds in aged individuals
The cholinergic hypothesis has been mischaracterized in the intervening years, as researchers sought a contrast to the wellsupported and etiological amyloid hypothesis despite the fact that
At about the same time, in a TINS review, we raised the possibility that the cholinergic atrophy could be secondary to a cortical lesion in AD
Nonetheless, the cholinergic hypothesis continues to be maligned as having "failed to cure AD."
The cholinergic hypothesis led to the development of treatments, which have shown temporary cognitive benefits in patients
It is remarkable, given the widespread and irreversible brain damage already present at AD clinical presentation, that cholinergic therapy can still exert these beneficial cognitive effects.
After the publication of Bartus's paper, it was reasonably assumed that there should be a trophic NGF failure
However, paradoxically, it was shown that NGF mRNA is unchanged in AD
When it was later demonstrated that the signal previously measured as NGF was in fact proNGF, i.e., the NGF precursor molecule

A NOVEL NGF METABOLIC PATHWAY AND ITS PHARMACOLOGICAL VALIDATION
In light of the above, our laboratory investigated how mNGF was generated and released in the extracellular space by performing classical ex vivo superfusion of young rat cerebral cortex tissue
To our surprise, we found that, contrary to the prevalent dogma, proNGF (and not mNGF) was the molecular form released in an activity-dependent manner by cortical neurons ex vivo.
We found that released proNGF is converted to mNGF and ultimately degraded by metalloproteases in the extracellular space.
The conversion of proNGF into mNGF was found to be performed by plasmin, a serine-protease derived from plasminogen when cleaved by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
This process is regulated by neuroserpin, the main inhibitor of tPA in the target regions of the BF cholinergic system
Newly formed mNGF exists only transiently in the extracellular space as it binds to its cognate receptors (tropomysin receptor kinase A [TrkA] and p75NTR receptors) and is retrogradely transported to the cholinergic neurons cell somata where it exerts its trophic actions
We demonstrated that the non-internalized, extracellular remnants are likely to be degraded by activated matrixmetalloprotease 9 (MMP-9), a process controlled by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1).
We also showed that the enzymes, zymogens, regulators, and inhibitors necessary for proNGF maturation and subsequent mNGF degradation are released simultaneously alongside proNGF in the extracellular space upon neuronal stimulation.
The term NGF metabolic pathway was therefore coined to refer to this coordinated array of enzymatic conversions
We further validated this pathway by demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of the maturation or degradation enzymatic pathway can trigger proNGF/mNGF imbalances
In particular, continuous infusion of Î±2-antiplasmin, the endogenous inhibitor of plasmin, in the cerebral cortex of rats led to reduced levels of mNGF, which further led to cortical cholinergic synaptic atrophy.
Conversely, infusion of MMP2-9 inhibitor induced an increase in mNGF levels by preventing its degradation, which was associated with cholinergic synaptic sprouting
In a further study, impaired proNGF cortical maturation following infusion of Î±2-antiplasmin was sufficient to alter BFCN phenotype.
In particular, there was a significant atrophy of cell bodies as well as a downregulation of p75NTR and TrkA, and a reduction in the expression of ChAT protein, further validating the importance of the extracellular NGF metabolic pathway for the phenotypic maintenance of BFCN
The experimental studies highlighted above reinforce the concept that imbalances in the NGF metabolic pathway can contribute to impairment of the BF cholinergic system, as seen in AD and down syndrome (DS), thereby providing a platform to investigate AD pathogenesis through the NGF pathway perspective.

THE NGF METABOLIC PATHWAY IN AD AND IN DS WITH AD PATHOLOGY
Following the discovery and validation of the NGF metabolic pathway, we applied this paradigm to the study of human brain material in AD and DS, both of which exhibit a marked atrophy of the NGF-dependent BF cholinergic system.
In AD brains, proNGF levels are increased
However, we demonstrated that there is in fact a compromise in the conversion of proNGF to biologically active mNGF as well as a likely exacerbated degradation of mNGF
In addition, at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage (a prodromal stage of AD), the pathway is already compromised and shows increased MMP9 activity, which would facilitate the degradation of mNGF
This would suggest that the NGF dysfunction appears early in the course of the disease, before or concurrent with the earliest cognitive impairment and may constitute a relevant therapeutic target.
As individuals with DS inexorably develop AD neuropathology
These studies eloquently illustrated a compromise of the NGF metabolic pathway responsible for the conversion of proNGF to mNGF in DS brains with AD pathology.
Levels of plasmin and tPA mRNA were reduced, preventing proNGF maturation and resulting in the pathological brain buildup of proNGF.
DS brains also exhibited elevated zymogenic activity of MMP9, thereby exacerbating the degradation of the limited amount of available biologically active mNGF
These results have been further reviewed in
In a further extension, levels of key members of the NGF metabolic cascade, inflammatory mediators and AÎ² peptides were assessed in plasma samples from a clinically characterized cohort of DS individuals, longitudinally followed for 2 years.
Levels of proNGF, MMP-1 and MMP-3, and MMP-9 activity were even elevated at AD asymptomatic stages.
In addition, this study provided compelling evidence that DS/AD asymptomatic individuals showing elevation of plasma proNGF levels at the 1year follow-up experienced a greater cognitive deterioration the subsequent year.
Furthermore, in DS individuals of advanced age there was a strong correlation between brain amyloid-beta (AÎ²) load and the elevation of proNGF, strengthening the association between AÎ² and NGF metabolic pathway dysfunction
A similar progressive deregulation of the NGF metabolic pathway has been found in transgenic rats modeling the AD-like amyloid pathology

NOVEL DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE IMPLICATION OF THE CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM IN AD
New developments, such as the ones highlighted above, have led to a renewed interest regarding the neurobiology of the BF cholinergic system in health and in neurodegenerative conditions.
Recent observations note that long term treatment with donepezil, one of the leading acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChEis) (elevating the "cholinergic tone") used for its symptomatic cognitive benefits in AD, was shown to reduce the rate of change in regional cortical thickness in individuals suspected of prodromal AD
Conversely, recent studies provide evidence of brain atrophy and increased risk of dementia and AD in non-demented individuals receiving long term (over 3 years) medications with drugs possessing primary or secondary anti-cholinergic properties
In particular, there is consistent evidence for increased risk of dementia in the elderly receiving defined anticholinergic compounds
In addition, low doses of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine leads to poor cognitive performance in individuals revealing a posteriori AD-like brain amyloid burden
It is also interesting to note that a study from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) revealed that in humans the atrophy of the BF nucleus basalis of Meynert precedes and predicts memory impairment and the extent of cortical spread of the Alzheimer's pathology
In further extensions, these studies indicate that atrophy of the BF covaries with the cortical thinning and loss of PET-identified cholinergic projections to cortical regions
These studies therefore reaffirm that the BFCN are central to the AD pathology and its cognitive outcomes.
This concept is frequently questioned by the fact that cholinergic therapy only provides modest and transient cognitive relief in AD.
As such, it should be noted that novel drugs targeting the cholinergic system, beyond the cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the symptomatic treatment of AD, are emerging as therapeutic tools, in particular muscarinic receptor agonists
In particular, a combined M1 muscarinic-sigma 1 receptor was shown to have a remarkable effect in diminishing amyloid pathology and the associated cognitive impairment in a transgenic rat model of ADlike amyloid pathology, even after a treatment "wash-out" of a month (equivalent to 3 years of human life)
The above strongly suggest that trophic preservation of BF cholinergic neurons (i.e., normalization of the NGF metabolic pathway) could constitute an effective avenue to achieve diseasemodifying effects.
An appropriate therapeutic window for such an approach should lie at pre-symptomatic stages of AD, before the cholinergic system is compromised beyond repair.
Such goals await the development of biomarkers defining unequivocally a progressing AD pathology before its clinical presentation.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
This discussion paper highlights the significance of the NGF metabolic pathway for the maintenance of a healthy phenotype of BFCN and synapses, a system key for higher CNS functions.
It illustrates how the compromise of this pathway likely underlies the atrophy of BFCN in AD (see Figure
Recent clinical data would indicate that these trophic mechanisms might not necessarily be unidirectional, as the current NGF dogma indicates.
Future studies may reveal novel insights into possible reciprocal interactions between the BF cholinergic system and the NGF metabolic pathway, both in physiological and pathological conditions.
Further to it, research on such trophic interactions could help identify novel biomarkers signaling a progressive preclinical AD pathology and pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for AD and associated pathologies with NGF cholinergic involvement.
