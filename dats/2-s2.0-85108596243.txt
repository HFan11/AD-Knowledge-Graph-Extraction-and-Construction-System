Mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles ameliorate Alzheimer's disease in rat models via the microRNA-29c-3p/BACE1 axis and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
Currently, Alzheimer's disease (AD) cannot be treated effectively.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) (MSC-EVs) exhibit therapeutic effects on many diseases.
This study investigated the mechanism of bone marrow MSC-EVs (BM-MSC-EVs) in a rat model of AD.
The cognitive function, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, Aβ deposition areas and levels of Aβ1-42, Aβ decomposition-related factors (NEP and IDE), and inflammatory cytokines in BM-MSC-EVs-treated AD rats were measured.
The effect of BM-MSC-EVs was studied in AD neuron model.
microRNA (miR)-29c-3p and BACE1 expression, as well as levels of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related factors in AD and EVs-treated AD models were detected.
miR-29c-3p relationship with BACE1 was predicted and confirmed.
miR-29c-3p and BACE1 were interfered to verify the mechanism of EVs in AD.
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor DKK1 was further added to EVs-treated AD neurons.
BM-MSC-EVs showed therapeutic effects on AD rats and neurons.
BM-MSC-EVs carried miR-29c-3p into AD neurons.
miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1.
Silencing miR-29c-3p in BM-MSCs reduced BM-MSC-EV therapeutic effect on AD, which was reversed after BACE1 knockdown.
miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1 and activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibition impaired EV therapeutic effects on AD.
We highlighted that BM-MSC-EVs delivered miR-29c-3p to neurons to inhibit BACE1 expression and activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby playing a therapeutic role in AD.
This study may provide a novel perspective for elucidating the mechanism of MSCs in the treatment of AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common type of dementia worldwide and frequently accompanied by memory impairment, cognitive decline, disorientation, and even death
Pathologically, AD is predominately characterized by the formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, together with the subsequent loss of neurons
Inflammation has been shown to be involved in the early stages of AD pathogenesis
It remains challenging to characterize AD, and a vast majority of patients are not diagnosed until the middle or advanced stages when the brain has shown irreversible damage
Currently, despite the certain efficacy of six approved drugs for AD treatment, they only relieve symptoms and fail to intervene AD pathologically

AGING
Therefore, developing more effective approaches for AD therapy is of great urgency.
Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanometer-sized cell-secreted membrane vesicles, have been proven to play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, and EVs-based therapy may present with tremendous clinical benefits
Almost all cell types can secrete EVs, and among them, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) are the most promising due to their easy accessibility and maintenance, which have been found to play an amazing therapeutic role in neurodegeneration
MSC-EVs have been validated as effective therapeutic delivery tools for AD
MSC-EVs suppress iNOS expression and alleviate neural impairment in AD mice
MSC-EVs counteract neuroinflammation and enhance antioxidant capacity, thus serving as a potential therapy to retard Parkinson's disease progression and ameliorate symptoms
It is well established that EVs shuttle their functional cargoes such as proteins, microRNAs (miRs), and phospholipids for intercellular communication
It has shown that MSC-EVs exert effects on brain diseases via the transfer of their carried miRs
miRs, a class of short noncoding RNAs, are tightly involved in AD pathogenesis, showing the strong potential of being therapeutic biomarkers for AD
miR-29c-3p has been proposed to be a helpful biomarker for AD with its downregulated expression
Also, previous literature has demonstrated that miR-29c-3p expression can be detected in MSC-derived EVs and exert cardioprotective effects
However, the underlying interplay between MSC-EVs and miR-29c-3p in AD has not been fully elaborated.
Therefore, we took the initiative to speculate that bone marrow MSC-EVs (BM-MSC-EVs) may play a role in AD with the involvement of miR-29c-3p.
Consequently, we performed a series of histological and molecular experiments to identify the effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD, and to explore the related regulatory mechanism, in order to provide some novel therapies against AD.

RESULTS

BM-MSC-EVs were successfully isolated
MSCs have been used to treat the animal model of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases
Recent studies have identified EVs as important mediators of cell signal communication
BM-MSC-EVs have been shown to play a regulatory role in a variety of diseases
BM-MSCs were firstly extracted from SD rats and observed 24 h later under an inverted microscope.
Some cells adhered to the wall with round shape and varied size.
After 4-5 days of culture, the number of adherent cells was gradually increased, and polygonal or spindle-shaped cell colonies were formed.
On the 10 th day, the cells were passaged when growing to 90% confluence.
BM-MSCs of the 2 nd generation were mainly spindle-shaped with vortex distribution, showing typical morphologies of BM-MSCs (Supplementary Figure
Flow cytometry showed that the surface markers CD29 (97.78%) and CD90 (78.21%) were highly expressed, while the hematopoietic stem cell markers CD34 (0.078%) and CD45 (0.79%) were poorly expressed (Supplementary Figure
In addition, BM-MSCs were induced for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, and their osteogenic/ adipogenic differentiation potentials were verified (Supplementary Figure
The above results indicated that BM-MSCs were successfully isolated.
Additionally, BM-MSC-EVs were identified as discshaped bilayer membrane structures with round and oval shape and a diameter of 50-100 nm under a TEM (Supplementary Figure
According to WB results, EVs surface markers CD9 and CD63 were expressed in BM-MSC-EVs, while endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin showed no expression in BM-MSC-EVs (Supplementary Figure
NTA revealed that the main particle size of BM-MSC-EVs ranged from 30-100 nm, with a median of 90 nm (Supplementary Figure
From all above, we confirmed that BM-MSC-EVs were successfully extracted.

BM-MSC-EVs had therapeutic effects on AD rats
The rat model of AD was established by intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 to study the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD rats.
Firstly, the Morris water maze test was used to test rat motor ability.
We found that AD rats showed remarkably reduced motor ability (all p < 0.001) with no difference in swimming speed (Figure
Given that Aβ deposition is a typical AD pathology, we stained the rat cerebral tissues with Thioflavin S. AD rats exhibited obviously more Aβ deposition area and Aβ plaques than WT rats (all p < 0.001) (Figure
In addition, 6E10 antibody was further used for Aβ deposition staining
According to ELISA results, levels of Aβ1-42 and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα) in AD rat cerebral tissues were notably increased (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Furthermore, as shown by RT-qPCR and WB results, the expressions of NEP and IDE (two major Aβ-degrading enzymes) were obviously decreased (Figure
These results indicated that the AD rat model was successfully induced.

AGING
Subsequently, the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD were detected.
It was observed that EV treatment remarkably reduced escape latency of AD rats and increased the percentage of time in the target quadrant (all p < 0.001), with no change in the swimming speed (Figure
Additionally, EVs-treated AD rats showed noticeably reduced Aβ deposition area, plaques, and Aβ contents (all p < 0.01) (Figure
Levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) were also notably decreased after EV treatment (all p < 0.001) (Figure
EVs-treated AD rats exhibited markedly elevated NEP and IDE expressions

AGING
(all p < 0.05) (Figure
From all above, BM-MSC-EVs showed therapeutic effects on AD rats.

BM-MSC-EVs had therapeutic effects on AD hippocampal neurons
We have verified the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD rats, and then we further detected in vitro effects on hippocampal neurons.
The primary hippocampal neurons were firstly cultured.
On the 3 rd day of culture, the neurons formed neurites, which increased gradually and continued to extend.
On the 10 th day, the development of neurons became more mature and the neural network became denser (Supplementary Figure
The hippocampal neuron model of AD was established by Aβ1-42.
According to immunofluorescence assay and ELISA results, AD neurons showed remarkably increased Aβ deposition area and Aβ plaques, as well as elevated level of Aβ1-42 (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Aβ1-42-challenged neurons also exhibited markedly reduced cell viability and elevated apoptosis rate (all p < 0.001) (Figure
The above observations revealed that the neuron model of AD was successfully established.
Next, AD neurons were treated with BM-MSC-EVs.
It was found that Aβ deposition area and Aβ plaques were dramatically decreased after EV treatment (both p < 0.001) (Figure
EVs-treated AD neurons also exhibited noticeably reduced levels of soluble Aβ1-4 (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Additionally, EV treatment obviously increased neuron viability (both p < 0.01) (Figure
From all above, we verified that BM-MSC-EVs possessed therapeutic effects on AD hippocampal neurons.

AGING

BM-MSC-EVs carried miR-29c-3p into AD hippocampal neurons
EVs carry a variety of miRs for cellular communication
miR-29c-3p is poorly expressed in AD
Hence, we speculated that EVs exerted therapeutic effects on AD by carrying miR-29c-3p.
Firstly, miR-29c-3p expression in EVs was detected, and it was found that miR-29c-3p expression was obviously elevated in EVs but showed no difference after the addition of RNase A (p < 0.001) (Figure
Then miR-29c-3p expression in rats and neurons was detected, as shown by RT-qPCR results, miR-29c-3p was remarkably downregulated in AD rats and neurons, while EV treatment obviously elevated miR-29c-3p expression (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Moreover, AD neurons treated with PKH-26labeled EVs were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscopy, and we found EVs successfully entered the neurons (Figure
These results indicated that BM-MSC-EVs may be internalized by hippocampal neurons and then release miR-29c-3p to upregulate miR-29c-3p expression in neurons, thus showing therapeutic effects on AD.

miR-29c-3p knockdown reduced the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD hippocampal neurons
The above mechanism was further verified through experiments.
Firstly, miR-29c-3p inhibitor was transfected into BM-MSCs, and the inhibitory effect was verified by RT-qPCR.
BM-MSC-EVs were then extracted (EVs-inhibitor) and we observed that miR-29c-3p expression in EVs-inhibitor was notably decreased.
Similarly, EVs-inhibitor-treated AD neurons (AD-EVs-inhibitor) also showed obviously reduced AGING miR-29c-3p expression (all p < 0.01) (Figure
As shown by immunofluorescence assay results, Aβ deposition area and Aβ plaques in AD-EVs-inhibitor were noticeably increased (p < 0.001) (Figure
EVsinhibitor treatment also markedly upregulated level of Aβ1-42 in AD neurons (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Furthermore, according to MTT assay and flow cytometry results, EVs-inhibitor treatment dramatically reduced AD neuron viability (p < 0.01) (Figure
From all above, miR-29c-3p inhibition reduced the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD hippocampal neurons.
We proved that BM-MSC-EVs alleviated AD via carrying and releasing miR-29c-3p into neurons.

miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1 in AD
To further reveal the downstream molecular mechanism of EVs-carried miR-29c-3p in AD, we first searched the database (
Among them, BACE1, an Aβ precursor protein cleaving enzyme, is critical in AD
Hence, we speculated that there may be a binding relationship between miR-29c-3p and BACE1.
Based on the binding sites (Figure
Next, BACE1 expression in rat cerebral tissues and hippocampal neurons was detected.
As presented by RT-qPCR and WB results, BACE1 expression in AD rats was notably elevated, which was reversed after EVs treatment (both p < 0.01) (Figure
Similar results were also found in hippocampal neurons (both p < 0.001) (Figure
These findings indicated that BACE1 was highly expressed in AD, but EVs treatment inhibited BACE1 expression in AD.
Additionally, BACE1 expression in EVs-inhibitor-treated AD

AGING
neurons was detected and it was found to be upregulated obviously (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Collectively, we confirmed that BM-MSC-EVs-carried miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1 expression in AD neurons.

BACE1 knockdown reversed the effects of EVsinhibitor on AD
To verify the role of BACE1 in AD, we transfected AD-EVs-inhibitor-treated neurons with BACE1 shRNA

AGING
(AD-EVs-inhibitor-sh-BACE1), with AD-EVsinhibitor-treated neurons transfected with sh-NC (AD-EVs-inhibitor-sh-NC) as control.
Firstly, RT-qPCR and WB confirmed the successful intervention of sh-BACE1 (both p < 0.001) (Figure
According to our results, Aβ deposition area and Aβ plaques in the AD-EVs-inhibitor-sh-BACE1 group were dramatically reduced relative to those in the AD-EVsinhibitor-sh-NC group (p < 0.001) (Figure
Level of soluble Aβ1-42 was also markedly decreased after BACE1 knockdown in EVs-inhibitor-treated AD neurons (all p < 0.001) (Figure
As shown by MTT assay and flow cytometry results, cell viability was markedly increased (p < 0.001) (Figure
These results suggested that inhibition of BACE1 reversed the effects of EVs-inhibitor on AD hippocampal neurons.

BM-MSC-EVs activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via the miR-29c-3p/BACE1 axis
We have confirmed that BACE1 was the downstream target gene of miR-29c-3p.
The downstream molecular mechanism of BACE1 in EV therapeutic effects on AD AGING was further explored.
Studies have shown a negative regulatory relationship between BACE1 and the Wnt/βcatenin pathway
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is inhibited in AD
Therefore, we speculated that the miR-29c-3p/BACE1 axis affected the therapeutic effects of EVs on AD via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
According to RT-qPCR and WB results, the levels of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related factors (Wnt3a and β-catenin) were notably decreased in AD rats and neurons, while they were dramatically increased after EV treatment (all p < 0.001) (Figure
Additionally, after inhibiting miR-29c-3p in BM-MSCs, Wnt3a and β-catenin levels were noticeably reduced in EVs-treated AD neurons (all p < 0.001) (Figure
These results suggested that BM-MSC-EVs activated the Wnt/βcatenin pathway via the miR-29c-3p/BACE1 axis.

Inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway impaired the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD
To verify the role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the effects of BM-MSC-EVs-carried miR-29c-3p on AD, we conducted a combined experiment.
The Wnt/βcatenin pathway inhibitor DKK1 was added to BM-MSC-EVs-treated AD neurons.
As shown by immunofluorescence staining results, Aβ deposition area and Aβ plaques were notably increased after inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (p < 0.001) (Figure
ELISA results revealed that soluble Aβ1-42 level was also remarkably elevated after silencing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (all p < 0.01) (Figure
Moreover, the cell viability was dramatically decreased (p < 0.001) (Figure
Briefly, we proved that

DISCUSSION
AD is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease and causes typical cognitive impairment with no effective treatment currently
MSC-EVs show therapeutic potential to alleviate age-related disorders
The current study demonstrated that BM-MSC-EVs ameliorated AD via carrying miR-29c-3p into neurons to target BACE1 and activating the Wnt/βcatenin pathway (Figure
Numerous studies have provided compelling evidence that BM-MSC-EVs are promising candidates for treating multiple neurological diseases with their robust properties of anti-inflammation and neuroprotection
In the current study, following extensive characterizations of EVs isolated from BM-MSCs, we investigated the effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD.
It is well accepted that non-physiological deposition of Aβ leads to AD pathology
High Aβ1-42 level is related to AD genesis and progression
Decreased expressions of NEP and IDE (two critical Aβ-degrading enzymes) result in the promotion of Aβ deposition, thus aggravating AD
According to our results, EV treatment remarkably improved AD rat behaviors, reduced Aβ deposition and plagues, decreased levels of soluble Aβ1-42 and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), and elevated NEP and IDE expressions.
Similar results were further found in EVs-treated AD neurons, together with increased neuron viability and reduced apoptosis.
Consistently, BM-MSC-EVs have been shown to effectively inhibit Aβ plaque formation and carry the enzymatically active NEP, thereby promoting Aβ degrading and then alleviating AD
MSC-EVs possess anti-inflammatory and Aβ-degrading effects, showing protection against neuronal death and memory impairment in AD
From all above, we proved that BM-MSC-EVs showed therapeutic effects on AD rats and neurons.
As has been pointed out previously, EVs are promising biomarker sources for neurodegenerative disease therapy, which is attributable to their transfer of various functional components including miRs in intercellular communication
EVs can carry a variety of miRs for intercellular communication
It has been demonstrated that miR-29c-3p is present in MSC-EVs
Importantly, miR-29c-3p is downregulated in AD
However, the mechanism of MSC-EVs-carried miR-29c-3p in AD remained unclear.
We detected the expression of miR-29c-3p in BMSC-EVs, and found that BMSC-EVs carried miR-29c-3p, and BMSC-EVs could be internalized by neurons, and upregulate the expression of miR-29c-3p in AD neurons.
Therefore, we believed that BMSC-EVs carried miR-29c-3p into neurons.
In brief, miR-29c-3p was obviously elevated in EVs, and remarkably downregulated in AD rats and neurons, while EV treatment obviously elevated miR-29c-3p expression in AD.
Likewise, a previous work has pointed out that stem cell-derived EVs show therapeutic effects on AD via shuttling their biologically active cargoes including miRs
miR-29c-3p is tightly implicated in AD with its aberrantly downregulated expression, showing the strong potential of being an effective biomarker for AD
Briefly, BM-MSC-EVs carried miR-29c-3p into neurons.
Thereafter, we silenced miR-29c-3p expression in BM-MSCs to further verify the effects of EVs on AD.
As shown by our results, miR-29c-3p inhibition in BM-MSCs notably reduced the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD.
In support of reduced miR-29c-3p expression is intrinsically associated with Aβ-mediated inhibited neuron viability and increased apoptosis in AD
Aberrant miR-29c-3p expression is associated with neuroinflammation in AD
Taken together, BM-MSC-EVs alleviated AD via carrying and releasing miR-29c-3p into neurons.
Next, we shifted to investigating the downstream mechanism of EVs-carried miR-29c-3p in AD.
The online website predicted that there are many target genes downstream of miR-29c-3p, among which BACE1 plays a vital in AD
It is wellestablished that BACE1 induces the initial cleavage of AβPP, greatly contributing to the generation of Aβ and then the promotion of AD pathology
Hence, we chose BACE1 as the target gene to explore the mechanism of miR-29c-3p and BACE1 in AD.
Additionally, emerging studies have provided robust evidence that BACE1 exerts effects on AD progression via miR-mediated regulation
We proved that

AGING
BACE1 was highly expressed in AD and miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1.
In line with this, a prior work has also pointed out the targeted regulatory relationship between miR-29c-3p and BACE1 in AD-associated pathologies
Moreover, we found that silencing BACE1 reversed the adverse effects of EV-carried miR-29c-3p knockdown on AD.
Likewise, as has been demonstrated, downregulated BACE1 is tightly linked to the decrease of Aβ production and deposition, and eventually to the reduction of inflammation and neuron apoptosis
Briefly, BM-MSC-EVs alleviated AD via the miR-29c-3p/BACE1 axis.
Subsequently, the downstream mechanism of BACE1 was further explored.
It has shown that the deregulated Wnt/β-catenin pathway underlies AD onset and progression
Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses Aβ production and tau protein hyperphosphorylation in the brain, and critically, restoring Wnt/β-catenin signaling represents a unique target for the design of novel AD therapies
According to our observations, the levels of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway-related factors (Wnt3a and β-catenin) were notably decreased in AD rats and neurons, while they were dramatically increased after EV treatment.
After inhibiting miR-29c-3p in BM-MSCs, Wnt3a and β-catenin levels were noticeably reduced in EVs-treated AD neurons, which were then obviously restored after BACE1 knockdown.
Notably, miR-29c-3p inhibitor and sh-BACE1 treatments could not completely eliminate the effects of miR-29c-3p and BACE1, so the Wnt/βcatenin level in the AD-EVs-inhibitor-sh-BACE1 group did not restore completely.
Briefly, this study demonstrated that BM-MSC-EVs-carried miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1 and then activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in AD.
Accordingly, accumulating studies have highlighted the negative regulatory relationship between BACE1 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in AD
Moreover, inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway impaired the therapeutic effects of BM-MSC-EVs on AD.
Blockade of the Wnt signaling in AD increases Aβ formation, drives neuroinflammation, and leads to neuronal death
Collectively, we proved that BM-MSC-EVs-carried miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1 and then activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thus ameliorating AD.
All in all, this study supported that BM-MSC-EVs ameliorated AD via the miR-29c-3p/BACE1 axis and then the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation.
These results discovered a novel BM-MSC-EVs-based therapy for AD patients.
There were many deficiencies in this study.
For example, we didn't buy transgenic animals because of the shortage of research funds, but we reviewed the previous literature and found that intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ can effectively establish the animal model of AD and simulate the pathological state of AD
For these two reasons, we chose to establish a rat model of AD.
We will adopt more rigorous transgenic animals to carry out experiments if the research funds permit in the future.
Moreover, EVs can carry a variety of miRs for intercellular communication
This study failed to determine whether other miRs or mRNAs played a role in the treatment of AD, and the clinical application of BM-MSC-EVs in AD needs further verification.
In the future, we will further explore the functions of other miRs and mRNAs in AD, and determine whether there is a mutual regulatory relationship between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and BACE1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethics statement
This study was conducted with a firm compliance to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and got approval from the animal Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University.
Significant efforts were made to reduce animal numbers and their pain.

Isolation and culture of BM-MSCs
BM-MSCs were isolated and cultured using the whole bone marrow adherence method.
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (5-6 weeks; Beijing HFK Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3% pentobarbital sodium and disinfected with 75% ethanol for 5 min.
Under aseptic conditions, bilateral femurs and tibias were separated and metaphysis was opened to expose the medullary cavity.
Then the bone marrow was obtained after washing with low glucose-Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (L-DMEM) (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA, USA).
Following a centrifugation (100 g, 5 min), the supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was resuspended in L-DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Company, Grand Island, NY, USA).
The cell suspension was seeded (1 × 10 6 cells/mL) and cultured in an incubator (37° C, 5% CO2).
After incubation for 24 h, half of the medium was refreshed, and then the medium was refreshed every 2 days.
When growing to 80-90% confluence, the cells were passaged at a ratio of 1:2.
The morphology of BM-MSCs was observed under an inverted microscope (Zeiss Inc., AG, Oberkochen, Germany).
BM-MSCs of the 3 rd generation were selected for detection of the expression of stem cell surface markers AGING [(cluster of differentiation (CD)45 (ab33916), CD34 (ab81289), CD29 (ab36219) and CD90 (ab226) (all from Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA)] using flow cytometry.
In addition, other BM-MSCs of the 3 rd generation were cultured in osteogenic medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and adipogenic medium (Cyagen Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and stained with alizarin red (Cyagen Biosciences) and Oil red O (Sigma-Aldrich) to analyze the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential correspondingly.

Isolation and grouping of BM-MSC-EVs
When BM-MSCs of the 3 rd generation reached 80% confluence, the cells were rinsed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and the conventional medium was replaced with EVs-free FBS medium (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA).
After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested and subjected to several centrifugations (300 g/5 min; 2000 g/10min, 10000 g/35 min).
Afterwards, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane (Merck Millipore Ltd., Tullagreen, Ireland), followed by twice ultracentrifugation (100 000 g, 2 h).
The EVs were finally resuspended in 50-100 μL PBS with protein concentration measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and then stored at -80° C for further experiments.
Similarly, BM-MSCs were cultured in EVs-free FBS medium added with GW4869 (20 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and 48 h later the conditioned medium was taken as control (GW4869 group).
According to a previous study
EV morphology was observed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM)

Animal grouping and treatment
A total of 24 SD rats (200-220 g, 6-7 weeks, femalemale ratio of 1:2) were randomly allocated into normal control group [wild-type (WT)], model group (AD), model control group [AD-negative control (NC)] and model treatment group (AD-EVs), 6 rats in each.
Rats in the AD group, AD-NC group, and AD-EVs group were injected with oligomer Aβ1-42 (5 μg/μL) (Sigma-Aldrich) stereotaxically from lateral ventricle (anteroposterior: -0.8 mm; mediolateral: -1.4 mm; dorsoventral: -4.0 mm), and the needle was kept for 5 min and then withdrawn slowly.
Five days after Aβ1-42 injection, rats in the AD-EVs group were injected with 30 μg EVs (dissolved in 100 μL PBS) at the same position in lateral ventricle; rats in the AD-NC group were injected with the same amount of BM-MSC conditioned medium after GW4869 treatment.
The injection was performed once a month at the same time for two months.
Behavioral experiments were conducted three weeks after the last injection.

Morris water maze test
Morris water maze test
The rats were placed in a circular pool filled with water (1.2 m in diameter, 25 ± 1° C), and visual signals were placed around the pool.
The water maze experiment consisted of a visible test (day 0), a hidden platform test (days 1-5), and a probe test (day 6).
During the first two tests, rats were put into the pool four times a day, and escape latency (time to find the hidden platform) and swimming speed were recorded.
For those rats that did not find the platform within 60 s, they were placed on the platform for 15 s.
During the probe test, rats were released and allowed to swim freely for 60 s in a pool without platform, and the percentage of time in each quadrant was recorded.

Tissue sample collection
After behavioral tests, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and then immediately perfused with PBS (containing 4% paraformaldehyde).
Afterwards, the brain was removed on ice and the left and right hemispheres were quickly separated with the cortex and hippocampus of each hemisphere taken out.
Part of them was put into the eppendorf tube marked in advance, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80° C for subsequent experiments.
Another part was fixed overnight and incubated with 30% sucrose at 4° C until equilibrium.
The coronal sections were prepared using a cryostat (CM1850; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and preserved at 4° C.

Thioflavin S staining
The free-floating sections (30 μm) were subjected to a 10-min incubation with 1% Thioflavin S (Beijing Solarbio Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) dissolved in 50% ethanol, 2 washes with 50% ethanol, 5 min each, and then a 5-min washing with distilled water.
Next, the sections were mounted using Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium (H-1000, Shanghai Sanger Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).
Under the fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), the senile plaques were shown as green spots.
Statistical analysis was AGING performed using ImageJ 1.48 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Extraction and identification of hippocampal neurons
SD rats after birth within 24 h were washed with 75% alcohol, transferred into the intercellular space and placed in 75% ice ethanol for 2-3 min.
The rats were sacrificed by decapitation and their cerebral tissues were rapidly stripped.
Following 3 washes with precooled D-Hanks (Solarbio), the hippocampus was dissected from the brain under a stereomicroscope (Olympus), and washed three times with PBS to make the tissues sink to the bottom of the test tube.
Afterwards, the hippocampus underwent a 30-min detachment in a water bath at 30° C using 2 mg/mL papain solution (in Hibernate A), and a 12-min detachment using 20-60 µL DNase I (5 units/µL) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
Hippocampus that failed to be detached was filtered using a wet cell filter (40-mm mesh, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and centrifuged (1806 g, 10 min).
Next, the particles were resuspended in a plating media with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum (HI-HS), 5% HI-FBS, 2% B27, 0.5 mM glutamine, 1% N21-MAX and 0.5% P/S + Genta.
+ Amph.
Neurobasal A was supplemented with B and placed on a dish precoated with poly-D-lysine (10 µg).
At 2-4 h post-incubation, the medium containing 3% HI-HS, 2% B27, 0.5 mM glutamine, 1% N21-MAX and 0.5% P/S + Genta.
+ Amph was used.
Half of the culture medium was replaced with fresh serum-free neurobasal A every day.
The culture was added with µM cytosine arabinoside on day 3-4 to inhibit glial cell growth, and half of the medium was refreshed every 2 days.
