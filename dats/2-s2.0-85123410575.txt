Synapses, Microglia, and Lipids in Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by synaptic dysfunction accompanied by the microscopically visible accumulation of pathological protein deposits and cellular dystrophy involving both neurons and glia.
Late-stage AD shows pronounced loss of synapses and neurons across several differentially affected brain regions.
Recent studies of advanced AD using post-mortem brain samples have demonstrated the direct involvement of microglia in synaptic changes.
Variants of the Apolipoprotein E and Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid Cells gene represent important determinants of microglial activity but also of lipid metabolism in cells of the central nervous system.
Here we review evidence that may help to explain how abnormal lipid metabolism, microglial activation, and synaptic pathophysiology are inter-related in AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60-80% of total dementia diagnoses
Extracellular β amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the major pathological characteristics of AD.
The gold-standard for a definitive diagnosis of AD is post-mortem neuropathology
However fluid analytes-including most recently the development of the serum phosphorylated tau (threonine 217) blood test
Synapses are the sites at which neuronal communication takes place by chemical or electrical means
Synaptic plasticity refers to the brain's ability to modify neural circuitry structurally and functionally at the synaptic level to facilitate learning, memory, cognition, and the regulation of emotions and behaviours
Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) represent well researched mechanisms of synaptic plasticity which entail long lasting and activity dependent changes in synaptic efficacy as shown by in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recordings
Normal ageing is associated with a loss of synapses
This is markedly accelerated in AD which has been described as a disease of synaptic failure
Microglia are the central nervous system's (CNS's) resident phagocytes of mesodermal origin (predominantly from blood islands of the embryological yolk sac) and as such share many characteristics with macrophages of myeloid lineage
Microglia perform a number of key functions in the CNS: (1) synaptogenesis
Glia have long been implicated in AD since Alzheimer himself commented on their involvement in his original case report
A more detailed follow-up of microglia in AD began toward the end of the last century
Since then, microglial involvement has been demonstrated in many neurodegenerative
More recently in AD, microglia have been shown to internalise greater quantities of synaptic material during the symptomatic phase of the disease.
This has been demonstrated using confocal
Lipids are enriched in the CNS and figure prominently in AD pathophysiology
Lipids participate in cell structure, cellular signalling, energy balance, and inflammatory signalling
For instance, synaptogenesis is promoted by glia-derived cholesterol
The importance of lipids to brain health is highlighted by genetic connections between neurological disease and cholesterol metabolism
Most classes of lipids are involved in the pathogenesis of AD, including cholesterols, sterols, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids
The APOE ε4 allele represents the most direct genetic link between lipid metabolism and AD
APOE is highly expressed in the liver and brain where astrocytes are thought to be a main source
APOE is involved in the transportation and metabolism of lipids, functioning as a ligand for low-density and very lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL and VLDL, respectively) receptors that trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles
APOE appears to exert its effect on AD risk by influencing the time of disease onset as well as the total load of Aβ pathology

PROTEINOPATHY IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
β Amyloid β Amyloid (Aβ) is derived from the large type I transmembrane protein APP
APP undergoes a constant cycle of trafficking through the endomembrane system: it is first routed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, or trans-Golgi network
Nascent APP is post-translationally modified by glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulphation.
The small proportion of APP that reaches the plasma membrane is endocytosed within minutes and recycled or degraded in lysosomes.
Our recently published results also demonstrate a mechanism of "short-circuited" APP recycling governed by lactoferrin which results in increased Aβ production
APP may be proteolytically cleaved by γsecretase and either αor β-secretase.
β-secretase initiates the amyloidogenic pathway responsible for the generation of Aβ peptides.
β-secretase cleaves APP in the extracellular domain to form the secreted APP ectodomain (APPsβ) and the membranebound APP carboxyl-terminal fragment (βCTF).
βCTF is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase within the plasma membrane (termed regulated intramembrane proteolysis;
Cleavage by γ-secretase can occur at several sites; labelled the ε-, ζ-, and γ-site, respectively.
The γ-cleavage site varies in its position and is therefore responsible for the production of Aβ peptides of different lengths, from Aβ 37 to Aβ 43 (or longer).
This is of relevance to AD as Aβ 39/40 predominate in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)
The latter species are thought by some to constitute the neurotoxic oligomers responsible for initiating AD
Aggregates of Aβ filaments are observed as plaques in postmortem AD brains
Morphological subtypes of Aβ plaques include diffuse (also, "primitive" or "immature"), fibrillar, dense-cored (also "classical" or "mature"), and burnedout (also, "core-only") plaques.
Other Aβ plaque types include subpial bands
Neuritic plaques are a minority subset of Aβ plaques that are most often associated with phosphotau-positive dystrophic neurites.
Aβ plaques occur in most elderly but are not universal
Further, Aβ plaques are not sufficient to cause AD, however there is a strong association between their formation and the eventual development of AD as demonstrated by rare mutations (including APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) in familial early-and late-onset AD

Microtubule Associated Protein Tau
A hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) ("tau" for short) is the subunit of NFTs, neuropil threads, and tau positive dystrophic neurites
Tau is a member of the type 2 microtubule associated protein (MAP) family.
It is a highly soluble protein which is unfolded in its native state
It is expressed as six alternatively spliced isoforms with 0, 1, or 2 amino (N-) terminal inserts of 29 residues each (0N, 1N, or 2N; derived from exons 2 and 3) and 3 or 4 carboxyl (C-) terminal repeats of 31-32 residues (3R or 4R; derived from exon 10)
The full-length protein can be divided into an N-terminal "projection domain, " which is directed away from the microtubule, followed by a C-terminal "assembly domain."
The assembly domain is further subdivided into a proline-rich region, the microtubule-binding repeats, and a C-terminal tail
Tau contains 85 potential serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, most of which reside in the proline-rich region and the C-terminal tail
Tau exhibits many structural conformations, biochemical modifications, and the ability to interact with several different protein types, including chaperones, cytoskeletal proteins, kinases, motors, and phosphatases
However, unlike APP, mutations in MAPT cause frontotemporal dementia but not AD.
Tau is susceptible to a range of disease-related processes, including acetylation, glycation, glycosylation, methylation, nitration, oxidation, ubiquitination, truncation, and missorting to the somatodendritic compartment
Aggregations of phosphotau occur first as granular oligomers which then aggregate further to form fibrils
Soluble oligomers form early in the pathogenesis of AD and may represent the major neurotoxic substrate
Conversely, intraneuronal, insoluble fibrillar tau inclusions may represent end-stage lesions, appearing to be inert markers of earlier pathological changes to soluble tau species
Importantly, the density and anatomical spread of NFTs remain criteria for diagnostic and staging purposes

SYNAPSES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
The overall picture is that of a widespread loss of synapses and synaptic proteins in AD
During the symptomatic end-stage of AD the pronounced loss of synapses correlates with the severity of symptoms (DeKosky and
A series of studies demonstrated this using electron microscopy (EM)
Immunohistochemistry studies have also revealed a reduced density of synapses in the frontal cortex
The latter region also showed reduced post-synaptic drebrin
Widespread loss of drebrin, which is involved in synaptic morphology and plasticity
Furthermore, a reduction in the density of synapses is also apparent in mild cognitive impairment of the amnestic type in at least the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) subregion of the hippocampus
A subsequent meta-analysis of post-mortem human brain studies confirmed a reduction of synaptic density and loss of synaptic proteins in AD (de
This analysis also demonstrated that pre-synaptic molecules are more affected than post-synaptic molecules-particularly in the hippocampus compared to cortical areas.
Molecules of interest are listed below and a summary of their differential regulation in AD across different brain regions is provided in Table
Pre-synaptic markers included those involved in calcium sensing and buffering (e.g., parvalbumin; synaptotagminwhich contrasts with the immunoblot study mentioned above; and synaptophysin); cytoskeletal structures (septin 5 and 7); endocytosis (AP180, dynamin I); small GTPases (rab-3a, -5, and -7); SNAREs (complexins, SNAP25, synaptobrevin, syntaxins, VAMPs); vesicular tethering (synapsin I); and vesicles (SV2, synaptophysin, VGLUTs).
Post-synaptic markers included cytoskeletal proteins (drebrin, IRSp53, MAP2, GKAP, synaptopodin); a growth/plasticity marker (GAP43); a metal ion transporter (ZnT-1); protein dephosphorylation (spinophilin); neurotransmitter receptors (GABA, muscarinic, NMDA); and molecular signalling components (CaMKII, PSD95).
Common pre-/post-synaptic molecules included those involved in adhesion (catenin β, N-cadherin, NCAM); calcium homeostasis (calbindin, calretinin); cytoskeletal proteins (actin); protein phosphatase (calcineurin); receptors (TrkA); and REDOX signalling (thioredoxin).
Overall, there was a loss of pre-, post-, and common-synaptic markers across several brain regions in AD.
Interestingly, markers of cytoskeletal organisation were significantly elevated in hippocampal pre-synaptic areas but were decreased in the frontal, cingulate, entorhinal, and temporal cortices.
The latter areas also showed increased expression of post-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors.
Notably, APP was not examined in these studies despite it's presence at both pre-and post-synapses
Early stages of AD are characterised by an apparently compensatory inverse relationship between the increased size of pre-synaptic terminals and the loss of synapses across many cortical and limbic structures
Further, deimpregnation of Golgi-stained neurons followed by Congo red staining has shown that tangle-bearing neurons in the CA1 of the hippocampus exhibit a more extensive dendritic tree than tangle-free neurons
It appears that brain areas which normally show an elevated level of synaptic plasticity (for instance the mesial temporal lobe) are associated with increased expression and phosphorylation of tau and are therefore also most prone to the formation of NFTs.
Tau dysfunction in these temporal and limbic areas may be further propagated by local neuronal death which would result in increased neuroplasticity demand in adjacent neurons and projection targets which would themselves subsequently be subject to tau dysfunction and the build-up of phosphotau

Expression Microarrays Have Demonstrated the Differential Regulation of Synaptic Genes Across Different Stages of Alzheimer's Disease
Expression microarray data has demonstrated the downregulation of many synaptic genes in late-stage AD
These included SNAREs such as synaptobrevin 2 and SNAP25, and SNARE-related genes, including, synapsin I and II, synaptotagmin 1 and 5, dynamin 1, synaptopodin, rab-3a, syntaxin 6, bassoon, and piccolo, amongst others.
Interestingly, several gene transcripts were increased in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in AD, including, SNAP23, synaptopodin 2, and synaptobrevin 1.
Other pathways that were downregulated in the hippocampus included neuromodulatory peptides (e.g., BDNF, corticotropin releasing hormone, somatostatin, cortistatin, histamine, and tachykinin), voltage-gated ion channels (e.g., Ca 2+ , K + , and Na + ), and an extensive number of transporters, receptors, and enzymes that are required for the synthesis of different neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, dopamine, glycine, noradrenaline, and serotonin.
An earlier investigation using laser capture microdissection of tangle bearing neurons in the CA1 showed upregulation of genes regulating early (rab5) and late endosomes (rab7) which paralleled the downregulation of genes encoding neurotrophin receptors (TrkB; TrkC) over disease progression
In contrast, there appears to be an upregulation of genes related to synaptic plasticity before the formation of AD-type neuropathology in the medial frontal cortex of asymptomatic Braak stage II and III brains
The same set of genes were only downregulated in the same region following the appearance of Aβ plaques and NFTs in more advanced Braak stages (IV-VI).
Among other proteins, Braak stage II was associated with increased expression of several voltage-gated K + channels-regulators of the action potential; GABA receptor subunits; neurotransmitter exocytosis (e.g., SNAREs such as SNAP25, complexin I, synaptotagmins, VAMP7); clathrin heavy chain 1 and protein kinase C-involved in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis; corticotropin releasing hormone; cell adhesion molecule with homology to L1CAM and doublecortin-like kinase 1-proteins involved in neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth; p21-activated kinase 1involved in activity dependent synaptogenesis; glycine receptor β-involved in the regulation of synaptic connectivity; and stathmin-like 2-a regulator of microtubules during axonal extension.
The authors suggested that these expression patterns are indicative of increased synaptic activity and plasticity over the course of Braak stages I-II.
Further, they argue that these synaptic alterations are a compensatory response to increased intracellular Aβ and APP fragments containing the Aβ peptidedemonstrated by 4G8 immunoreactivity-which have inhibitory effects on synaptic plasticity in a mouse model and in vitro
Similarly, synaptoneurosomes derived from early AD cases and individuals with mild cognitive impairment show increased expression of neuroplasticity and synaptic transmission genes such as synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), growth associated protein 43 (GAP43), lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 (LPPR4), glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA 2 (GRIA2), cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A)
Notably, somatostatin was downregulated in the study by
The PVC and PreC also showed increased syntaxin binding protein 2 (STXBP2)-involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking.
The PreC represented a relatively moderately affected area in AD compared to the PVC and showed decreased synaptotagmin 2 (SYT2) and SNAP25, suggesting that these genes are downregulated relatively soon after their upregulation in the earlier stages of AD.
Single-cell RNAseq performed in the entorhinal and prefrontal cortices have shown downregulation of excitatory transmission genes (e.g., SNAP25; RIMS1) in AD
The latter study found enrichment of regulators of myelination, inflammation, neuronal survival, and global stress response (especially in late-stage disease).
However, early stages of AD were associated with the downregulation of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal genes, which contrasts with findings from the gene microarrays described above.
More recently, another study which examined tissues from frontal, temporal, and entorhinal cortices concluded that AD may be subclassed according to either the upregulation or downregulation of genes involved in excitatory synaptic transmission
This study also corroborated findings from previous RNAseq studies that AD is characterised by dysregulation of genes involved in immune activity, mitochondrial organisation, and myelination in addition to synaptic dysfunction.
A single-nucleus RNAseq study also identified impairment of angiogenesis in addition to immune response, myelination, and synaptic signalling in the prefrontal cortex of AD cases (Braak stage ≥ 4)
A metaanalysis of transcriptomic data from bulk human AD and mouse tissue showed that the gene signature of synaptic dysfunction in human disease broadly overlapped with the signature seen in mice with a low AD-type pathological burden, which supports the concept of synaptic and neuronal dysfunction as an early event in AD
Finally, a pre-print of one study which used fluorescence-activated cell sorting of NFT-bearing and NFTfree soma from Braak stage VI AD prefrontal cortex showed NFT-bearing neurons were associated with an upregulation of genes involved in synaptic transmission, including a core set of 63 genes seen across different neuronal subtypes that were enriched for synaptic vesicle cycling (e.g., SNAP25; SYT1 encoding synaptotagmin 1) and transsynaptic signalling (e.g., NTRK2 encoding the BDNF receptor TrkB)
This result appears consistent with the suggestion that neurons with a high neuroplastic demand are most prone to tangle formation as discussed above.

Experimental Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease Have Demonstrated Reduced Synaptic Plasticity
LTP and LTD-though to a lesser extent-have been intensively investigated (and reviewed) in experimental animal models of AD
Electrophysiological recordings have shown reduced LTP in certain APP mouse strains
Similarly, APP/PS1 mice show reduced LTP
A triple transgenic model (3×Tg-AD mice expressing human APP, PS1, and MAPT mutations)
displayed impaired LTP which correlated with intraneuronal Aβ before the formation of Aβ plaques and NFTs
Loss of synaptic spines in primary neuronal cultures derived from APP/PS1 mice was shown to cause the loss of coordinated neuronal activity which eventually translated to impaired transmission efficiency and the breakdown of global neuronal network transmission
Conversely, other experimental systems have demonstrated that injury or denervation induced neuroplasticity leads to the upregulation of APP
It is therefore conceivable that neuroplasticity changes associated with tau pathology act upstream of neuron activity-dependent generation of Aβ and its attendant neuronal network dysfunction-a scenario which is consistent with the synaptic gene microarray data outlined above and which may be especially relevant to sporadic AD
Thus pharmacological rescue of synaptic function represents an area open to pharmacological intervention
The ultrastructure and quantitative biochemistry of dendritic spines were recently described in greater detail
In their investigation the authors combined mass spectrometry, EM, and super-resolution microscopy to annotate 47,000 spines for 110 synaptic proteins in cultured, predominantly glutamatergic, hippocampal neurons.
The combination of these data allowed the authors to construct 3D models of the average stubby and mushroom spines.
Both types of spines showed similar protein copy numbers and spatial organisation.
It would be interesting to determine how the protein, and even lipid, content of spines might change in relation to the timing of Aβ and tau pathology across the AD continuum using similar techniques.
For instance, the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum can be up to 10 times greater in AD transgenic mice compared to wild type controls which can impact synaptic structure and function

MICROGLIA IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Microglia constitute a dynamic population of cells in the CNS
They exhibit significant functional plasticity that is also reflected by morphological diversity.
It was through the study of morphology that these intrinsic cells were first conclusively implicated in diseases of the CNS
Microglia can be distinguished from other cells of the CNS using EM without antibody-based techniques
Dark microglia are the most recently described type using EM
These microglia display signs of oxidative stress, including an electron dense cyto-and nucleoplasm with remodelling of chromatin.
They are reactive cells seen in chronic stress, ageing, and in CXCR1 knock-out and APP/PS1 mice.
The morphology of microglia is influenced by many factors, including diet and obesity
Interestingly, microglia may also contribute to sex differences observed in neurodegenerative diseases
Most recently in the field of AD, microglia are suggested to contribute to the propagation of Aβ by acting as carriers in brain tissue of young human APP-expressing 5×FAD mice

Genomic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease and Models of the Disease
The understanding of the molecular signatures of microglia has been expanded considerably over the last decade
RNAseq in mouse models of AD has been used to identify neuroprotective "disease-associated microglia" (DAM) as described by
Single-cell RNAseq has also uncovered (mouse) disease stage-specific microglial signatures, including two profiles characterised by either type I or II interferon response genes
Another RNAseq study in mice showed that immunological imprinting of microglia by either training (a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharides) or tolerance (multiple injections) exacerbated or attenuated cerebral Aβ pathology, respectively
It is important that caution is exercised when interpreting results from mouse studies given the key differences between human and mouse single-cell microglial transcriptomes
It appears that the binding of Aβ to pattern recognition receptors, including the receptor for advanced glycation end-products, nucleotidebinding oligomerisation domain-like, scavenger, formyl peptide, and toll-like receptors-among other mechanisms-is sufficient to cause neurotoxic activation of microglia
A number of mechanisms by which neurotoxic microglia exert their effects are proposed including the release of cytokines such as interleukins (ILs), interferons, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) which are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients before the onset of symptoms
Furthermore,
Inhibition of glycolysis in microglia exposed to Aβ by treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) resulted in reduced IL1β and TNF-α and preserved mitochrondrial function compared to microglia exposed to Aβ only.
Several genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed for late-onset AD
Many of the common allelic variants which exert only a small effect size on the overall risk of developing AD are those expressed by myeloid cells and microglia in particular
Other gene categories implicated include those involved in the processing of APP, endosomal-lysosomal vesicle cycling, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism and transport.
Gene network and proteomic analyses also suggest that microglia have a role in AD.
Gene-regulatory networks have demonstrated the differential regulation of microglial genes governed by DAP12 (encoded by TYROBP) and TREM2 signalling pathways
A study of protein networks in end-stage cortical AD tissue showed enrichment of microglial and astroglial markers suggesting that both are important effectors of cognitive impairment late in the disease course
TREM2 rare variants represent the strongest risk factor for developing sporadic late-onset AD after the much more common APOE variants.
The R47H variant more than doubles the risk of AD
This polymorphism causes the expression of a truncated protein and a loss of function which results in reduced clearance of Aβ
Another related set of genes implicated by GWAS is the MS4A family which includes risk polymorphisms in the MS4A4A and MS4A6A subtypes-the latter being significantly upregulated in both the PreC and PVC in our recent RNAseq report
These proteins are key regulators of cellular activation and levels of soluble TREM2
The loss of TREM2 facilitates the accumulation of tau pathology but only in the presence of Aβ
Again, the roles of microglia at different stages deserve attention.
For instance, one in silico transcriptomic analysis supports the role of TREM2/TYROBP signalling during early stages of disease whereas later stages were associated with soluble TREM2 and nuclear factor κβ (NFκβ)
TREM2 and CSF1R are emerging targets for diseasemodifying therapeutics in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases
CSF1R is a transmembrane protein expressed by myeloid cells.
Its ligands include CSF1 and IL34
The exposure of 5×FAD mice (expressing three APP and two PSEN1 human mutations) to CSF1R inhibitors show reduced proliferation of microglia which are characterised by a shift to an anti-inflammatory profile and are associated with reduced neuronal loss
Later work also showed CSF1R inhibitors prevented the formation of parenchymal Aβ plaques, but not CAA
TREM2 is a transmembrane immunoglobulin expressed by microglia
Notably, there is controversy surrounding the expression of TREM2 by human microglia as the recruitment of peripheral myeloid cells may have been underappreciated to date
Notwithstanding this caveat, it appears that an effective microglial response to Aβ is TREM2dependent and limits the extent of phosphotau pathology
The loss of function of TREM2 (as seen with the R47H mutation) results in reduced binding affinity to APOE compared to wild-type protein, resulting in reduced clustering of microglia at Aβ plaques and increased Aβ load
Interestingly, TREM2 (+/-) deficiency is associated with increased Aβ plaques and phosphotau-positive dystrophic neurites compared to complete knock-out of TREM2 (-/-) in AD mice, demonstrating a complex relationship between microgliosis and plaque-associated neurofibrillary pathology
More broadly, the loss of TREM2 function is also associated with reduced microglial survival
Similarly, a loss of APOE function is associated with an impaired microglial response to AD pathology
It appears the interaction between APOE and TREM2 is required for an adequate microglial response to Aβ pathology
Single-cell RNAseq of human microglia demonstrated the loss of a subset of microglia which highly express APOE and TREM2 in the context of AD
Whilst APOE deficiency in APP/PS1 mice was associated with reduced density of Aβ plaques, remaining plaques showed reduced compaction, a loss of microglial clustering around plaques, worsened NFD, and a significant downregulation of immunerelated genes
Unexpectedly, the complete knock-out of microglia-specific APOE in 5×FAD mice did not alter plaque load, number of microglia, or clustering of microglia but was associated with increased average plaque size
The APOE ε4 allele contributes to the disruption of glial homeostatic functions
APOE4 carriers show an increased number of activated microglia compared to APOE3 controls
It is likely that other microglial pathways, such as the activation of the inflammasome with increased downstream caspase-1 and IL1β activity
The cross talk and role of other glial cells over the course of AD will also have to be closely investigated for a more complete understanding of the disease and may open new avenues of therapies.
For instance, astrocytic IL3 has been shown to promote the neuroprotective activation of microglia
Distinct microglial transcriptional profiles are associated with Aβ or tau pathology
There were two subclusters labelled "AD1" and "AD2" which were of particular interest.
AD1 microglia were most prominent in cases with only Aβ pathology in which the microglia correlated with Aβ load and localised to Aβ plaques.
This correlation was absent in AD cases exhibiting both Aβ and tau pathology.
AD2 microglia occurred in AD cases with both Aβ and tau pathology in which these microglia correlated with phosphotau.
AD1 microglia showed enrichment of markers of phagocytosis and activation, including ITGAX, LPL, GPNMB, MYO1E, and SPP1.
AD2 microglia showed enrichment of homeostatic genes (e.g., CX3CR1 and P2RY12) and a number of neuron-related genes such as GRID2, ADGRB3, and DPP10.
Among the eleven other subclusters was one enriched for genes of proliferation (e.g., TOP2A and MKI67), another for markers of cellular stress (e.g., early response genes-FOS and JUNB; heat-shock genes-HSPA1A and HSPA1B), and homeostatic subclusters which were inversely correlated with the load of Aβ or tau pathology.
The correlation of microglial genes with Aβ pathology was noted recently by us
The latter genomewide expression analysis also demonstrated correlations between genes of synaptic plasticity to tau pathology.
The close association between Aβ and activated microglia prior to tau deposition has now been noted in post-mortem neuropathological studies

Post-mortem Immunohistopathology Highlights the Degeneration of Microglia in Advanced Alzheimer's Disease
A characterisation of the morphological subtypes of microglia in AD and their relationship to Aβ and NFD across differentially affected regions of the AD brain was performed in our lab
In this study, a major feature of cortical AD tissue was the dramatic reduction in the number of healthy ramified Iba1-positive microglia in the ITC-a severely affected area of the AD brain in terms of neuronal loss and cortical atrophy.
The observed reduction in Iba1 and its fragmented distribution can be assumed to have serious implications for the motility
Interestingly, the ITC showed a significantly increased density of activated microglia in preclinical AD cases only (cognitive controls with Alzheimertype pathological changes at post-mortem-CAc).
Activated microglia with reduced branching also increased with age as seen in an earlier
Further, the density of clusters of activated microglia was significantly higher in mildly affected areas of the AD brain such as the primary motor cortex (PMC) and PVC.
Findings in the PMC also demonstrated the clustering of activated microglia around Aβ plaques ahead of the formation of dystrophic neurites
However, the total percentage of microglia associated with a cluster was <2% and only a minority of Aβ plaques were associated with a cluster-the proportion of which decreased in a stepwise fashion from mildly to severely affected regions.
Lastly, the internalisation of synaptophysin-positive pre-synapses was found to be significantly elevated in the superior frontal cortex of AD cases compared to both CAc and controls without ADtype pathology using super-resolution microscopy
Synaptophysin is one of the most severely affected synaptic markers in AD
It would be of interest to determine if the microglia observed in our latter study were targeting viable neurons or those already marked for removal or undergoing apoptosis.
The concept of protective microglial activation early in the disease time course followed by degeneration associated with a loss of homeostatic function during the end-stage of disease is increasingly appreciated
A previous investigation has highlighted the stark contrast between APP-based animal models which show strong activation of microglia and post-mortem human hippocampus which contrastingly showed a weak microglial response
The loss of ramified cells in AD observed by us has been validated in a larger cohort by others-albeit without the expected loss of branching complexity of residual cells (Franco-Bocanegra et al., 2021)and has similarly been associated with AD-type neuropathology in the brains of people with Down's syndrome
Dystrophic microglia were also associated with NFD in our investigations
However, in our study brain pH showed a stronger correlation with dystrophic microglia than disease status
More broadly, this would have important implications for -omics studies using post-mortem human tissue if the prominence of the immune signalling pathways is a residual of brain pH

LIPIDS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Genome Wide Association Studies Have Identified Lipid Metabolism as a Major Risk Category in Alzheimer's Disease
The plasma membrane and the internal cellular endomembranes are mainly composed of lipids.
There are many factors which affect lipid metabolism, including, age, sex, genetics, diet, and physical activity
Lipids are transported throughout the body as lipoproteins, molecules which have a hydrophobic centre of cholesterol, esters, and triglycerides surrounded by amphipathic phospholipids with the addition of apolipoproteins.
Lipids influence the trafficking and proteolytic cleavage of key proteins in AD and their propensity to selfaggregate (Di Paolo and
As discussed above, AD GWAS results can be divided into anomalies in neuroimmune function, endocytosis, and lipid (and cholesterol) metabolism
The genetics underlying lipid metabolism are of particular interest as the dissociation of phospholipids may be the defining feature of neurodegeneration in AD
The major drivers of the enrichment of lipid metabolic pathways in GWAS (excluding APOE) include ABCA7, a key regulator of cellular cholesterol, and apolipoprotein genes APOM and APOA5
Additional genes identified from GWAS that are involved in lipid metabolism include other apolipoproteins (APOA1, APOA4, APOC1, APOC2, APOC3, APOC4, and APOJ); an intracellular cholesterol transporter (NPC1) and membrane-bound cholesterol pumps (ABCA1, ABCA2, and ABCG4); phospholipid transporters (ATP8A1, ATP8A2, ATP8B4, PCTP, and PLCG2); intracellular lipid receptors (OSBPL7 and OSBPL9); a high-density lipoprotein receptor (SCARB1); hepatic lipase (HTGL) and endothelial lipase (LIPG); MALlike protein (MALL)-a component of cholesterol rafts; sterol O-acyltransferase-1 (SOAT1)-involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol esters; and a fatty acid transporter (SLC27A4)

Alzheimer's Disease Is Characterised by Broad Dysregulation of Lipid Compounds in Blood Plasma and Across Different Regions of the Brain
Alzheimer's disease is characterised by significant dysregulation of fatty acid
For example, a study by
Metabolomic analyses of two brain autopsy series (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Religious Orders Study) showed that whilst cholesterol is unchanged in AD brains, cholesterol precursors are reduced and decomposition metabolites (including non-enzymatically generated cytotoxic oxidised forms-oxysterols) are increased
However, at least one other study showed elevated cholesterol levels in cortical samples of AD brains
Glycerolipids such as monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol are increased in the frontal cortex and blood plasma early in the pathogenesis of AD
Conversely, triglycerides-the predominant glycerolipid in the body-are reduced in plasma of mild cognitive impairment and AD
Other plasma lipidomic studies have also demonstrated reduced levels of most cholesteryl esters
Glycerophospholipids are the major constituent of the cell membrane
Glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, ethanolamine plasmalogen, and cardiolipin are significantly decreased in the AD cortex, with certain species inversely correlated to AD severity
Blood serum also shows significant reduction of glycerophospholipid content
Lastly, sphingolipids including sphingomyelins
Other sphingolipids including sphingosine 1-phosphate
Notably, plaque-associated lipids have been successfully visualised
Lipid deposits co-localised with Thioflavin-Spositive Aβ plaques and showed either lamellar structure or occurred as coalescing macro-aggregates up to ∼25 µm in size.
Conversely, diffuse plaques did not show the same association with lipid structures.
Aβ oligomers have been shown to bind to the cell membrane to cause rupture or pore formation capable of eliciting apoptosis associated with mitochondrial death

Experimental Models of Alzheimer's Disease Suggest That Abnormal Lipid Metabolism, Neuropathological Tissue Changes and Cognitive Impairment Are Linked
There are several experimental systems which have been used to elucidate the mechanisms by which lipid and related pathway alterations cause neurodegeneration.
APP/PS1 mice have demonstrated a connection between lipid derangements and cognitive impairment
Serum triglycerides readily cross the blood-brain-barrier and contribute to the impairment of memory and learning
Cholesteryl esters-the storage product of excess cholesterol-have been identified as an upstream regulator of tau pathology using inducedpluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying APP mutations (van der
In this study the reduction of cholesteryl esters reduced phosphotau by increasing proteasome activity.
Other studies have examined the role of lipid receptors.
For instance, the deletion of low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP1) in adult mouse forebrain neurons lead to global defects in brain lipid metabolism, including decreased cholesterol, sulphatides, ceramides, and glycerolipids which culminate in synaptic loss
In line with this, a recent report demonstrated that the overexpression of lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) markedly reduced APOE and attenuated NFD and neurodegeneration in P301S mice
In addition, changes to lipid content in PLB4 mice expressing human β-secretase 1 (hBACE1) have shown brain region-specific vulnerabilities to lipid dysregulation such as in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, suggesting that changes to lipid content may leave certain brain regions more susceptible than others
The Interrelationships Between Synapses, Microglia, and Lipids in Alzheimer's Disease Brain cholesterol dysmetabolism is related to synaptic dysfunction in a number of neurological diseases
Microglia have an important role in lipid metabolism
Microglia are capable of sensing excess saturated fats and modulating hypothalamic control of energy metabolism
They are also sensitive to fatty acids derived from the body's microbiota through which they may modulate Aβ deposition
More closely related to AD, the Aβ-induced reduction in sphingosine kinase, an important regulator of lipid secretion from neurons, is associated with defective microglial phagocytosis and is also associated with increased expression of the cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL1β, IL6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and reduced IL4, TGFβ, and arginase-1
They are also essential for remyelination following injury via TREM2-dependent lipid droplet biogenesis-a process which incidentally involves the esterification of cholesterol
It also appears that phagocytic activity governed by TREM2 transcriptionally regulates cholesterol transport and metabolism, whereby TREM2-deficient microglia capably phagocytose myelin debris but fail to clear excess cholesterol resulting in the accumulation of cholesteryl esters
Indeed, "lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia" (LDAM) accrue with age in humans and mice and exhibit defective phagocytic capability, overproduce reactive oxygen species, and secrete excess signalling cytokines such as TNFα, IL1β, and IL6
The accumulation of lipid droplets have also been noted in APP/PS1 chimeric mice xenografted with wild-type or R47H-TREM2 mutant iPSCs
In the latter study, the R47H mutation resulted in reduced clustering of microglia at plaques but critically did not impair the formation of lipid droplets within individual cells.
Microglia also appear active in the regulation of cholesterol-modulated phosphotau pathology through activation and phagocytic pathways
Excess cholesterol and other lipids are detected by microglial TREM2 (amongst other receptors) when complexed with apolipoproteins (such as APOE or APOJ) which in turn activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling cascade
The remote attenuation of neuronal kinases potentially occurs through reduced expression of the aforementioned TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 as described in TREM2-overexpressing P301S transgenic mice
Further, autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction appears sufficient to cause lipid droplet formation in microglia, increased IL1β and TNFs, and is associated with enhanced intraneuronal tau pathology and substantial synaptic degeneration
Several studies have identified distinct transcriptomic profiles in murine DAM for pattern recognition, lipid metabolism, and lysosomal pathways.
Recently,
Together these findings demonstrate a close relationship between microglial lipid metabolism and phagocytosis.
The role of the complement pathway in microglia-mediated clearance of synapses in certain CNS regions is well established
More recently,
However,
Mutations in the sushi repeat protein X-linked 2 (SRPX2) protein expressed by neurons have been identified in controlling complement pathway-mediated synapse elimination by microglia.
They also reported that SRPX2 (-/Y) knockout mice have increased C3 deposition and microglial synapse engulfment in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN).
Avila-Martin et al. (
Lipid molecules are processed by the intracellular phagolysosomal system to yield free cholesterol which may be stored internally as cholesteryl esters or secreted by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
Aβ may be degraded in autophagic vacuoles, via the ubiquitin-proteasomal system, or by any of a number of Aβ-degrading proteases including the metalloendopeptidase and matrix metalloproteinase families of catabolic enzymes.
Furthermore, DAP12 activation following TREM2 binding results in the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling cascade which reduces the secretion of signalling molecules such as IL1β, IL6, and TNFα which in turn is associated with reduced activation of intraneuronal GSK3β-an important protein kinase responsible for tau phosphorylation and which is also involved in the activation of γ-secretase through its interaction with presenilin 1.
The R47H loss of function mutation in TREM2 and the APOE ε4 allele (both indicated in red) represent two factors which impair Aβ and lipid processing by microglia.
Abnormal TREM2/DAP12 signalling may result in reduced PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling and disinhibition of IL1β, IL6, and TNFα secretions, leading to increased intraneuronal phosphotau and the exacerbation of Aβ accumulation (indicated by the red arrows).

vascularisation and recovering synapse loss associated with SCI.
In another study,
In our RNAseq study, C4A (encoding C4) and C5AR1 expression was increased in the PreC, with the latter also increased in the PVC
Interestingly CFHR5 (involved in the regulation of the alternative complement pathway) expression was substantially reduced in the PVC.
A number of recent studies highlight the impact of lipid metabolism on complement signalling pathways.
For instance, complement factor C3 and C4 levels have been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity and insulin resistance (Arias de la Rosa et al., 2020), fat distribution
In animal studies, findings have also demonstrated that peptide antagonists of complement receptors C3aR and C5aR inhibited diet-induced obesity, adipose inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction in rats and ameliorated inflammatory responses in murine macrophages
In the brain,
In AD, clearance of Aβ has been shown to be significantly impacted by the presence of lipids as well as by lipid metabolism which may indirectly inhibit complement-mediated microglial clearance of Aβ plaques.
Time-lapse atomic force microscopy has demonstrated that the presence of cholesterol in the cell lipid bilayer significantly enhances Aβ 42 aggregation
Lipid membranes containing cholesterol promote Aβ 42 aggregation via a heterogeneous nucleation pathway
Finally, TREM2 may exert toxic effects later in the disease through a failure of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and increased IL1β, IL6, TNFα, and complement proteins despite showing protective effects earlier in the disease through the clearance of Aβ.
Significant amounts of lipids are found inside the plaque and in neighbouring glial cells.
One cell probably representing a microglial cell is shown in the lower right.

Thus the reactivation of complementmediated synaptic pruning is a distinct possibility in AD
Refer to Figure
On a positive note, it has been shown that age-related microglial activation can be reduced by increased physical activity given a recent retrospective study which found associations between late life physical activity, reduced microglial activation, reduced synaptic loss, and better cognitive outcomes
Although microglia have been a focus here, the role of other glial cells bear careful consideration.
For instance, oligodendrocytes may be an important source of complement deposition in AD
Indeed, single-nucleus RNAseq has demonstrated diverse astrocytic signatures in AD characterised by the enrichment of inflammatory, proteostatic genes, and metal ion homeostatic genes
Notably, the involvement of metal ions in AD have recently been reviewed by

CONCLUSION
A purely biochemical, cell-autonomous view of AD-in which neurotoxic species of Aβ and phosphotau are solely responsible for neurodegeneration-has been described as "untenable"
Our own work suggests that the activation of microglia early in the disease time course is neuroprotective.
The basic science on microglial biology is accelerating but remains a knowledge gap in our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.
For instance, it appears that at least some of the lipid associations seen in GWAS manifest through the dysfunction of microglia rather than simply the disruption of cellular membranes or neuronal function.
The activities of microglia in AD represents one avenue for therapeutic intervention
However, given the complexity of the disease it is not unreasonable to expect that personalised treatment
To add complexity, further consideration for mixed pathology will also be essential in the management of patients in whom the dementing syndrome is caused by the cumulative effect of different disease states
Lastly, the accumulation of lipids in amyloid plaques as well as in glial cells including microglia (Figure

FIGURE 3 |
FIGURE 3 | Age-related myelin degeneration and dyslipidemia represent two risk factors for the accumulation of saturated fats and other lipids in the brain.
These lipids may be internalised by microglia and stored as cholesteryl esters.
Lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia (LDAM) accumulate with age and are associated with increased secretion of IL1β, IL6, TNFα, complement molecules, and show impaired maturation of phagosomes and reduced phagocytic capacity.
As demonstrated in Figure2, the increased secretion of certain cytokines and impaired phagocytosis are linked with more severe neuropathological changes.
The signalling cytokines are also implicated in the activation of oligodendrocytes (which may be a source of excess complement deposition) and the neurotoxic activation of astrocytes (for which saturated fats are a sufficient driver).
Increased expression and deposition of complement proteins may represent a key event in the targeting of synapses by microglia in AD.
