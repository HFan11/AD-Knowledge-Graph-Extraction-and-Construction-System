TRPV1-Mediated Microglial Autophagy Attenuates Alzheimer’s Disease-Associated Pathology and Cognitive Decline
Autophagy is a major regulator of the ageing process of the central nervous system and neurodegeneration.
Autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
TRPV1 was reported to regulate autophagy to protect against foam cell formation and reduce the release of inflammatory factors in atherosclerosis.
In this study, pharmacological activation of TRPV1 with the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin induced autophagy in a TRPV1-dependent manner in both primary microglia and BV2 cells.
TRPV1-mediated autophagy regulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation by controlling the expression of genes required for aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in primary microglia.
TRPV1 agonist capsaicin decreased amyloid and phosphorylated tau pathology and reversed memory deficits by promoting microglia activation, metabolism, and autophagy in 3xTg mice.
These results indicate that TRPV1 was a potential therapeutic target for AD, which suggests that capsaicin should be further assessed as a possible treatment for AD.

INTRODUCTION
Autophagy is a major regulator of the ageing process of the central nervous system and neurodegeneration, during which toxic molecules and organelles aggregate in intracellular autophagosomes and are then degraded in lysosomes
Autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD)
Upregulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, an important regulator of the autophagy pathway, is associated with reduced autophagy in AD patients
Deletion of the beclin 1 (BECN1) gene, which codes for a key autophagy-related protein (ATGs) in autophagosome formation, is reported to increase both the intracellular and extracellular deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques in animal models of AD
Therefore, induction of autophagy might be one of the promising therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of AD.
Mounting studies have evaluated the role of autophagy on neuron in neurodegeneration, emerging evidence shows that autophagy may also be involved in microglia immune function
Microglia, akin to tissue resident macrophages, are brain immune cells that are important for central nervous system homeostasis including modulating learning and memory, monitoring neuron activity, and acting as local phagocytes
Microglia can respond to brain damage and engulfing brain-derived cargo including axonal fragments and protein deposits such as Aβ plaques.
In the peripheral immune system, autophagy was shown to involve innate and adaptive responses
Both immune tolerance and chronic inflammation during aging have shown to correlate with autophagy flux impairment in macrophages
While few studies have evaluated the role of autophagy on microglia immune function including phagocytosis and inflammation, as well as the possible impact of autophagy dysregulation of these brain-resident macrophages during the pathological condition such as AD.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) was expressed in microglia and activation of TRPV1 triggered an increase in intramitochondrial Ca 2+ concentration and following of mitochondria depolarization which resulted in enhancement of chemotactic activity in microglia
Capsaicin-induced activation of TRPV1 causes the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ, which significantly increases the expression of ATGs in vitro and reduces the release of inflammatory factors in a wildtype (WT), but not TRPV1 -/-, mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
Moreover, TRPV1-mediated autophagy rescued mouse cardiac function in a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus
In this study, we hypothesized that TRPV1-mediated microglial autophagy would reduce amyloid and phosphorylated tau pathology and attenuate cognitive decline in a mouse model.
TRPV1-mediated autophagy regulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in microglia by controlling the expression of genes required for aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.
Cellular uptake of Aβ 1-42 was facilitated by TRPV1 activation in microglia.
To explain the potential beneficial effect of a TRPV1 agonist in AD, the use of 3xTg mice models demonstrated that TRPV1 was a potential therapeutic target for AD and TRPV1-mediated microglial autophagy.

The extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was detected by an XF glycolysis stress test kit, including 10 mM glucose, 0.5 μM oligomycin, and 50 mM 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG).
Results were analyzed and exported using Wave 2.6.0 version (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).

Measurement of Autophagy Flux
The autophagy levels were measured as previously reported
In brief, the BV2 cells and primary microglia were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/well and cultured overnight, after which cells were transfected with mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmids (Addgene, Inc., Watertown, MA, United States) for 48 h according to the manufacturer's protocol
Media was aspirated and then cells were incubated with 10 μM capsaicin or 2 μM rapamycin for 24 h.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and the digital images of LC3-positive puncta were captured by TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH).
The numbers of LC3-positive puncta per cell in each experimental group were counted with ImageJ software.

For quantification of cellular uptake, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Aβ 1-42 (FITC-Aβ 1-42 , GenicBio Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) on a concentration of 2 μg/ml for 4 h; next, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and the nuclear stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI).
The microglial phagocytic activity of FITC-Aβ 1-42 was quantitatively detected using a Cellomics KineticScan reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Western Blotting
Cultured cells and the mice hemibrain tissue were lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, P0013B) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride.
The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C.
The supernatants were subsequently boiled at 100 °C for 10 min after adding 5× sodium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer.
There were 50 μg protein samples separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
The membrane was blocked in tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h.
After being incubated with primary antibodies (Table

For all analyses, at least three images were taken in each brain region, and slides used ×40 oil objective, at 1024 × 1024 resolution, with z-step size of 0.99 μm at 13.8 μm.
For the quantification of colocalization of LC3B and Iba-1, LC3B and NeuN, or p-tau (Ser396) and NeuN, FIJI 2.0 plugin coloc2 were utilized.
In brief, images were imported to FIJI, and data channels were separated.
Then FIJI plugin coloc2 was switched on, and Manders' colocalization index was calculated and recorded.
For the quantification of 4G8 + β-amyloid, data of fluorescent area was measured and recorded.

Two-Dimensional Morphological Analysis of Microglia
Two-dimensional morphological analysis of microglia was performed using ImageJ as described previously
Briefly, 20 microglial cells per group that randomly selected from both cerebral cortex and hippocampus were segmented into singlecell using a custom-written ImageJ plugin.
Single-cell images were automatically converted to 8-bit and transformed into binary images by application of automatically calculated intensity threshold.
The parameters "Mean branch length" and "end-point voxels" were quantified using FIJI plugins "Skeletonize" and "Analyze skeleton 2D/3D" to skeletonize and analyze the binary single-cell images obtained in the previous step

Novel Object Recognition Assessment
Novel object recognition assessment was conducted on two successive days.
On Day 1, mice were placed in a corner of an empty mouse open field box and allowed to explore for 8 min.
On Day 2, mice were placed in the open field box with the two same objects and allowed to explore for 8 min 4 h later, mice were exposed again to a novel and a familiar object and allowed to explore for 8 min.
Exploring activities, including facing, touching, and/or sniffing the object, were recorded and analyzed in SuperMaze, and the percent of the time mice spent exploring the novel object was calculated.

Y Maze Spontaneous Alteration Test
Y maze spontaneous alteration test included 2 sections.
In the first section (training trial), mice were placed into one arm (start arm) and allowed to explore in two arms for 5 min.
After 1 h interval, the third arm was opened as a novel arm.
In the second section (test trial), mice were placed in the Y maze and allowed to explore all three arms for 5 min.
Activities of mice in the Y maze were recorded in SuperMaze, and spontaneous alteration (percent) was calculated, which was defined as the number of times to novel arm divided by total arm alterations minus 2 × 100.

Morris Water Maze Behavioral Assessment
Morris water maze behavioral assessment was performed as previously described
Briefly, the tests were performed in a 120 cm diameter, 45 cm deep circular pool with opacified water kept at 20 ± 1 °C.
An escape platform whose diameter is 4.5 cm was placed 1 cm below the surface of the water.
Recording and analyzing system (Shanghai Jialiang Software Technology Co, Ltd.) was also applied.
Training consisted of daily sessions (4 trials per session) for 6 consecutive days.
Mice were put into the pool from 4 pseudorandomly varied cardinal points.
Each mouse was required to find the hidden platform within 60 s and offered 60 min intertrial interval.
Mice would be placed on the platform for an extra 10 s if they did not find the platform in 60 s.
After 6-days' training, the platform was no longer presented and the mice took a probe trial, in which each mouse was put into the pool from two pseudorandomly varied cardinal points and performed for 60 s.
Behavioral characteristic (swim distance, swim speed, latency, time spent in each quadrant, and number of times of platform crosses) was recorded and analyzed.

Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed via

Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analyses
Weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) were performed to analyze 3xTg mice brain co-expression networks that were changed after capsaicin treatment
Co-expression networks were built by WGCNA package in R
Considering the equilibration between power and scale independence, the power of 12 was chosen to build scale-free topology for all datasets.
The mean of the trajectory of the module eigengenes (MEs) of given modules was calculated by first taking the row sum of the adjacency matrix as the intra modular connectivity score per gene, and then the average of the intra modular connective score in the given modules was calculated.
Genes in given modules were enriched into pathways of both GO and KEGG using Metascape (

Metabolite Profiling
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were conducted on a Q Exactive ™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap ™ Mass Spectrometer equipped with an Ion Max ™ source and a Heated Electrospray Ionization (HESI-II) Probe, which was coupled to a Dionex UltiMate ™ 3000 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
External mass calibration was performed, using a standard calibration mixture, every 7 days.
For metabolite profiling, microglia were stimulated with Earle's balanced salts solution (EBSS) for 24 h.
Cells were collected and centrifuged.
Then, the cell pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS.
Polar metabolites were extracted using 1 ml of ice-cold 80% methanol with 10 ng/ml of valine-d 8 as an internal standard.

RESULT TRPV1 Activation Induced Autophagy and Energetic Metabolism in Microglia
To determine the impact of TRPV1 channels on microglial autophagy, the autophagy marker and the structure of microglia were examined following treatment with capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, by Western blot and transmission electron microscopy.
Upregulated expression of the microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B, LC3B-II) and LC3B-I proteins was observed in BV2 cells treated with 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 20 μM capsaicin for 24 h, in a dose-dependent manner (Figures
Strikingly, abundant multilamellar structures suggestive of autophagosomes were found in BV2 cells treated with 10 μM capsaicin, but not in the control cells (Figure
Given that autophagy plays an important role in metabolism and cell survival of microglia
Mitochondrial length and mitochondrial area were increased in the capsaicin group compared to the control group (Figures
The OCR represented mitochondrial function and assessed under sequential treatment of oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone, and antimycin A. Capsaicin treatment increased the maximal respiratory capacity of microglial mitochondria (Figures
The expression levels of OXPHOS and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle genes were decreased in the brain of TRPV1 -/-mice compared with the WT group (Figures
However, the ECAR analysis showed that glycolysis and    glycolytic capacity were decreased in capsaicin treated BV2 cells compared to the control group (Figures
Collectively, the results suggested that TRPV1 participate in autophagy and cellular energy metabolism in microglia.

TRPV1 Activation Promotes Autophagic Flux and Phagocytosis in Microglia
The mRFP-GFP-tagged LC3 reporter was introduced to further characterize the role of TRPV1 in microglial autophagy.
The location of mRFP-GFP-LC3 was monitored in BV2 cells and primary microglia with 10 μM capsaicin or 2 μM autophagy activator rapamycin treatment (Figures
GFP (green fluorescent protein) is sensitive to the acidic condition of the lysosome lumen, while mRFP (red fluorescent protein) signal is more stable
Capsaicin induced a significant upregulation of green and red puncta in both BV2 cells and primary microglia.
Meanwhile, gene deletion of TRPV1 (TRPV1 -/-) attenuated the autophagic flux in primary microglia with capsaicin treatment (Figures
To investigate the implication of TRPV1 on microglial phagocytic capacity, the cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml FITC-Aβ 1-42 for 4 h after pretreatment with 10 μM capsaicin for 24 h (Figures
The phagocytic capacity was increased in both BV2 cells (Figures
This induction was completely abolished in TRPV1 -/--deficient microglia.
These data indicate that capsaicin improved microglia energy metabolism, followed by the enhancement of immune function including autophagic flux and phagocytic capacity.

TRPV1 Deficiency Curtails Energy Metabolism in Microglia via Autophagy Inhibition
To investigate how TRPV1 controls metabolism of microglia, polar-metabolite profiling of WT and TRPV1 -/-microglia was performed via liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to capture the intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle.
In brief, microglia were incubated with EBSS to induce autophagy.
As shown in Figure
Moreover, there was a greater abundance of metabolites generated by the pentose phosphate pathway, which is crucial for the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids in EBSS-stimulated microglia (Figure
Stimulation of TRPV1 -/-cells resulted in a sharp decrease in the amounts of polar metabolites, such as glucose 6phosphate (Figure
Consequently, there were notable reductions in the amounts of nucleotides and amino acids in TRPV1 -/-cells (Figure
Stimulation of WT microglia caused pronounced upregulation of not only Slc2a1 and Slc2a3, but also several glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase 2 (Hk2), aldolase A (Aldoa), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1), and enolase 1 (Eno1) (Figures
This induction was completely abolished in TRPV1 -/--deficient microglia and microglia treated with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (Figures
The transcription of many of these enzymes is controlled by metabolic regulators including c-Myc, HIF-1a, and IRF4.
We found that upon EBSS-stimulation induced autophagy, transcripts of Myc, Irf4, and Hif1a were strongly induced in WT cells but not in TRPV1 -/--deficient or chloroquine-treated microglia (Figures

TRPV1 Activation Reversed Learning and Memory Impairment of 3×Tg AD Mice by Improving Autophagy
Capsaicin treatment was shown to promote Aβ clearance in primary microglia in vitro (Figure
The therapeutic efficacy of the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin was examined in 8-month-old 3xTg mice.
3xTg mice showed significant impairment of learning and memory ability at 8months-old compared to age-matched WT mice (Figures
Capsaicin treatment significantly reversed impaired recognition to novel object or novel area in novel object recognition assay (Figure
A probe trial was conducted in Morris water maze test after a 6-days' training session to evaluate memory ability in regard to a spatial reference (Figure
Memory was strongly impaired in 3xTg mice as compared to the WT group (Time in the target quadrant; Figure
The number of platform crosses was increased in the 3xTg + capsaicin group as compared to the 3xTg group (Figure
These results suggested that capsaicin treatment ameliorated 3xTg mice neurodegeneration in learning and memory.
AD pathology including β-amyloid accumulation and hyperphosphorylated tau was further observed to evaluate the therapy effect of capsaicin in 3xTg mice.
Immunoblotting showed upregulation of total tau and phosphorylated tau in 3xTg mice compared to WT mice.
Capsaicin significantly decreased the expression of both phosphorylated tau and total tau in 3xTg + capsaicin group mice compared to 3xTg group mice (Figures
Immunofluorescence of brain sections also showed a significant decrease of both phosphorylated tau (Ser396)
Those results suggested that capsaicin treatment on 3×Tg mice reversed their neurodegeneration process by decreasing the accumulation of β-amyloid and phosphorylated tau.

TRPV1 Activation Rescued Impaired Energetic Metabolism and Autophagy Function in the Brain of AD Mice Model
To identify the effects of activating TRPV1 on AD brain, we injected capsaicin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally; a single injection/ day) for 1 month on 7-month-old 3xTg mice.
RNA sequencing was performed to determine the phenotype of WT, 3xTg, or 3xTg + capsaicin brain transcriptionally.
WGCNA showed that four major modules identified dysregulation in 3xTg group mice.
Two upregulated modules (turquoise and blue) and two downregulated modules (red and pink) were detected in 3xTg + capsaicin group mice compared to 3xTg group mice (Figure
Enrichment analyses revealed the improvement of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrion organization, neuron and synapse function of 3xTg mice treated with capsaicin, as well as locomotory behavior (Figures
Capsaicin treatment also leads to decrease the levels of cell apoptotic process and response to oxidative stress (Figures
Those results showed ameliorated effects of capsaicin treatment by both improving cellular OXPHOS and mitochondrion function, leading to improvement of neuronal and synapse functions transcriptionally.
OXPHOS plays critical roles in brain energy metabolism, and OXPHOS dysfunction may lead to multiple kinds of neurodegeneration including AD

Genome-Wide RNA Sequencing of 3xTg Mice Reveals Treatment with Capsaicin Alleviates Pathological Hallmarks of AD in 3xTg Mice
Hierarchical clustering of capsaicin-treated 3xTg AD mice brains revealed differences in brain transcriptomes that corresponded to TRPV1 status (Figure
The transcriptomes included 20 differentially upregulated and 21 differentially downregulated genes in expression in 3xTg mice compared with 3xTg + capsaicin mice.
The 20 upregulated genes with the greatest differences in expression were listed in Table
The 19 genes with the greatest degree of downregulation were listed in Table
The GO Consortium classification (
biological process-and class-associated genes in 3xTg and 3xTg + capsaicin mice are shown in Figure
The most prominent were genes that function in metabolic process, biosynthetic process, corresponding to genes related to reactions in response to the decreased of nutrients and neurotransmitter in brain.
The 20 most enriched KEGG pathways in the WT vs. 3xTg mice are shown in Figure
Hierarchical clustering generated the heat maps of genes that regulate energy metabolic transcripts (Figure
Immunoblotting of total lysates from the mice brains showed the upregulation of energy metabolic AKT-mTOR-HIF-1α signaling pathway (Figure
Finally, we analyzed the genes associated with synaptic transmission and myelination according to the prompts of enriched biological processing (Figure
The heatmap depicted downregulated genes expression in 3xTg mice compared to WT mice, and capsaicin treatment on 3xTg mice upregulated synaptic transmission associated genes expression compared to 3xTg mice.
To investigate the changes on different kinds of synaptic receptors, mRNA levels of cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic receptors were detected
mRNA levels of glutamatergic receptor markers Slc17a6 (vesicular glutamate transporter 2, Vglut2) and Slc17a7 (Vglut1) were also downregulated in 3xTg mice compared to WT ones, FIGURE 6 | analysis of the expression of autophagy-associated proteins (n 5 in 3xTg and 3xTg + capsaicin mice, n 3 in WT mice).

These data demonstrate that brain of 3xTg AD transgenic mice were immune tolerant and metabolically defected in vivo compared with those of WT mice and suggested that treatment with capsaicin rescued pathological hallmarks of AD in 3xTg mice by promoting glial activation, metabolism, and autophagy.
To further investigate microglial activation of 3xTg mice with capsaicin treatment, morphological analysis of microglia was performed.
Microglia of 3xTg mice showed more end-point voxels and longer branch length than WT mice, which indicated a less activated state of microglia (Figures

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence that TRPV1-mediated autophagy reduced amyloid and phosphorylated tau pathology and attenuated cognitive decline in a murine model.
First, the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin induced autophagy lysosome biogenesis in microglia, which was abolished via gene deletion.
TRPV1 regulated the microglia metabolic process by controlling the expression of genes required for aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.
TRPV1 agonist capsaicin decreased amyloid and phosphorylated tau pathology and reversed memory deficits by promoting microglia activation, metabolism, and autophagy in 3xTg mice.
TRPV1 receptor was cloned in 1997 from the rat dorsal root ganglia, which was described as a specific target of capsaicin and resiniferatoxin
TRPV1 channel can be activated not only by endogenous compounds such as endocannabinoids and arachidonic acid metabolites, but also by exogenous agonist capsaicin
TRPV1 activation alleviates cognitive and synaptic plasticity impairments through inhibiting AMPAR endocytosis in APP23/PS45 mouse model of AD
TRPV1 is involved in the pathophysiology of conditions including chronic inflammatory pain, asthma, cystitis, diabetes-associated peripheral neuropathy, and hearing loss.
Pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 channel has potential for treatment of these conditions.
In our study, 3xTg AD mice model was used to find that activation of Ca 2+ -permeable TRPV1 attenuated memory deficits and the accumulation of Aβ and phosphorylated tau.
Capsaicin, the TRPV1 agonist, might have therapeutic potential for AD treatment.
TRPV1 reportedly protects against foam cell formation in oxidized low-density lipoprotein-treated vascular smooth muscle cells through the induction of autophagy
Autophagy sustains cell survival under nutrient deprivation conditions and the removal of aggregated proteins and damaged cellular organelles to maintain homeostasis.
In mammalian cells, three main types of autophagy exist, including macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperonemediated autophagy, which is a complex process involving many ATGs
The abundance of autophagy-related proteins, such as Beclin1, ATG5, and ATG7, declines with age and is exacerbated during AD
Autophagy has been explored in the context of alterations to the function and homeostasis of neurons, which leads to neuronal dysfunction.
While autophagy of the neuron has been implicated as a protective role in the early stages of AD
Previous studies showed that 10 μM capsaicin or 2 μM rapamycin treatment for 24 h could alleviate microglial activation and Aβ generation in SH-SY5Y-APP695 cells
We showed that pharmacological activation of TRPV1 with capsaicin attenuated the accumulation of phosphorylated tau and total tau (Figures
Capsaicin treatment in 3xTg mice showed a significant upregulation of energy metabolic mTOR/Akt/AMPK/HIF-1a pathway (Figure
Capsaicin treatment attenuated phosphorylated tau and Aβ accumulation in 3xTg mice by promoting glial activation, metabolism, and autophagy (Figure
Metabolic transcripts were measured including mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, biological oxidation, and integration of energy metabolism (Figure
The anionic carrier protein uncoupling protein 2 is mainly involved in the uncoupling of the mitochondrial proton transport chain.
Hexokinase 2 is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of hexose, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolysis pathway (Figure
Autophagyrelated gene3 encodes a ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme, which is a component of the ubiquitination-like system involved in autophagy, degradation, turnover, and recycling of cytoplasmic components (Figure
PTENinduced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a protein kinase, which participated in mitochondrial autophagy, and is mainly located in the inner membrane of mitochondria to protect mitochondria.
Previous studies revealed that capsaicin showed both dosedependent and dose-independent effects in hippocampal neuronal network performance in AD model and in vitro
Shibata et al. has reported that capsaicin-induced autophagy was a dosedependent process in neuronal cells, and our results were in line with previous findings
Moreover, mechanisms of capsaicin also included TRPV1-independent pathway
In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that activation of TRPV1 improved spatial learning and memory impairments in 3xTg mice via TRPV1-mediated autophagy and lysosomal pathways and activation of microglia, which together induced Aβ clearance.
Based on these data, activation of TRPV1mediated autophagy might be a promising therapeutic target against AD.
