Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in Post-Mortem Hippocampus and in Serum from Young, Elder, and Alzheimer’s Patients
One of the characteristics of the cerebral aging process is the presence of chronic inflammation through glial cells, which is particularly significant in neurodegeneration.
On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) participates in the inflammatory response.
Currently, evidence in animal models shows that the hallmarks of aging are associated with changes in the AHR levels.
However, there is no information concerning the behavior and participation of AHR in the human aging brain or in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
We evaluated the expression of AHR in human hippocampal post-mortem tissue and its association with reactive astrocytes by immunohistochemistry.
Besides this, we analyzed through ELISA the AHR levels in blood serum from young and elder participants, and from AD patients.
The levels of AHR and glial fibrillar acid protein were higher in elder than in young post-mortem brain samples.
AHR was localized mainly in the cytosol of astrocytes and displayed a pattern that resembles extracellular vesicles; this latter feature was more conspicuous in AD subjects.
We found higher serum levels of AHR in AD patients than in the other participants.
These results suggest that AHR participates in the aging process, and probably in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like AD.

Introduction
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor widely known for its role in mediating the detoxification of xenobiotics.
In the absence of its ligands, AHR remains inactive and forms a complex with the chaperone heat shock protein 90, p23, and AHR-associated protein, whose primary function is to retain AHR in the cytoplasm.
When AHR interacts with its ligands, it undergoes conformational changes that expose its nuclear localization sequence, thus promoting AHR translocation to the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT).
The complex formed by the AHR-ligand-ARNT binds to specific DNA regions called xenobiotics response elements or dioxin response elements located in the promoter regions of their target genes, to regulate their expression
In addition to its role in detoxification, AHR is involved in the circadian cycle and glucose metabolism
Besides this, it has been shown that AHR participates in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response
AHR-knockout mice exhibit characteristics linked with inflammation in glia and neurons, like the demyelination of optic nerve
In line with this evidence, Rothhammer et al.
Additionally, Rothhammer et al.
The involvement of AHR in the modulation of inflammation also suggests its participation in the chronic low-grade inflammation (so-called "inflammaging"), which is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases.
Regardless of the confirmed presence of the AHR in human brain cells
Aging is a time-related decline in biological functions, which ultimately results in organismal death
It is mainly accompanied by a shift within innate immunity toward a pro-inflammatory status.
Therefore, during aging, a chronic and generalized inflammation in the central nervous system occurs, especially in brain regions such as the hippocampus.
In neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation is higher than in healthy elder brains.
Thus, aging is one of the foremost risk factors for neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the principal neurodegenerative disease and the most common form of dementia (50%-56% of total cases).
Glial cells include microglia and astrocytes, which play a dual role by amplifying the effects of inflammation and the mediation of cell damage, and by the protection of the nervous system.
They undergo significant changes in aging and AD, namely the permanent activation of microglia and the increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is known as astrogliosis and is a hallmark of reactive astrocytes.
The above promotes a chronic inflammation that favors the loss of homeostasis and predisposes to neuronal death
These effects impair the structure and neuronal function during the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and other dementias.
At present, evidence in different cell lines
Therefore, taking into account the central role that AHR has in inflammation, and the scarce information about human AHR in conditions characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, like aging and Alzheimer's disease, in the present study, we evaluated the changes in the expression of AHR and GFAP in human hippocampal post-mortem tissue from young and elder subjects.
Likewise, we assessed AHR levels in serum from young and elder participants, as well as Alzheimer's patients.
We found that AHR participates in the aging process and probably in the development of AD through the response of astrocytes, which can release AHR into microvesicles.

Discussion
In this study, we show evidence that supports, to our knowledge for the first time, the AHR association in the aging process of the human brain and, probably, in the development of AD through the response of glial cells to a pro-inflammatory environment in the central nervous system.
We found an increase in the AHR expression in the brain of elder individuals and AD patients, with the most visible changes in astrocytes.
Additionally, the AHR serum level was higher in AD patients compared with elderly participants.
Taking into account that AHR-knockout mice are more susceptible to inflammation stimulus
Surprisingly, our results showed the opposite, since AHR in post-mortem brains and circulating AHR were higher in both aging and AD.
Our results are in line with recent data informed by Rothhammer et al.
In the same study, the authors suggested that the CNS-produced interferon (IFN) activates AHR in astrocytes to suppress inflammation.
Taking into account that the interferon has also been implicated in either aging or AD inflammation
Besides this, the AHR accumulation can also be triggered by the low levels of ARNT previously reported during aging.
ARNT is essential for the transcriptional activity of AHR, as it depends on the binding of ARNT.
Therefore, a lack of ARNT restricts the AHR localization to the cytosol, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity
Regarding the cell-type location, the AHR protein was located in astrocytes.
This finding can be explained by the fact that astrocytes are among the principal cells that participate in the modulation of inflammation during aging.
We observed the AHR protein mainly in the cytosol and not in the cell nuclei, which suggests that during human aging and in AD, AHR has an impediment to act as a transcription factor.
Also, in AD post-mortem brain tissue, we observed AHR with a morphology that resembles extracellular microvesicles (which can be exosomes or ectosomes, among others).
Our findings using post-mortem tissue are consistent with our evidence about serum AHR, since AHR could only be detected in the detergent-treated blood serum, which suggests that AHR is circulating through the bloodstream in microvesicles derived from the brain or other tissues.
The microvesicles, such as exosomes, participate in cellular communication mechanisms, with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier allowing the circulation through the bloodstream.
The molecular mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell communication through exosomes that transport proteins associated with neuropathologies can not only be used as a molecular marker of diseases, but can also provide a molecular pathway to identify and study the fundamental pathological changes of diseases like AD, from a different approach
The presence of exosomes in AD is usual since previous reports demonstrated that astrocytes stimulated with β-amyloid release exosomes enriched with molecules relevant for AD, like protease-activated receptor-4 and ceramide
Surprisingly, we observed that serum AHR decreases considerably in patients with AD aggravated with cerebral microangiopathy.
More evidence is required to discuss this observation that undoubtedly generates significant interest.
The AHR and the astrocytes are critical elements as mediators of diverse biological processes, such as the regulation of the immune system homeostasis in response to environmental toxicants
Therefore, continuing with the study from the biological and physiological responses between AHR and astrocytes in aging and neurodegenerative disorders can be helpful to explain complex diseases like AD (Figure
In addition, further validation of the findings in larger clinical studies is needed to know the role of arylhydrocarbons and AHR in aging or neurodegenerative diseases.
In conclusion, the AHR participates in the aging process and probably in the development of AD through the response of astrocytes, which can release AHR into microvesicles.
Our findings open a gap in the knowledge about the AHR regulation in the human neurodegenerative pathology, its association with glia, and the possibility that the AHR detected in the serum of patients with AD comes from the brain and is released into extracellular microvesicles (Figure

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Participants
This is a case-control study, in Mexican participants, that was performed in two phases.
For the first one, we studied post-mortem hippocampus tissue from young (20-30 years old, n = 7) and elder (>60 years old, n = 6) subjects of either sex, without infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic systemic disease and macroscopic abnormalities in the brain.
These samples were obtained from the Hospital General de México "Eduardo Liceaga".
We also studied post-mortem hippocampus tissues from AD patients of either sex (n = 3) that were obtained from the Brain Bank-LaNSE CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico.

Histochemical Analysis and Immunohistochemistry
Samples obtained from Hospital General de México were post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned to obtain slices of 5 µm.
Then, we analyzed the morphology trough the hematoxylin-eosin staining.
We received the samples from the Brain Bank-LaNSE as slices of 30 µm.
These slices were from hippocampal tissue fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and cut in freezing conditions.
Sections were washed with PBS and incubated with citrate buffer pH = 6 for antigenic retrieval, then they were washed and incubated with 0.3% H 2 O 2 for immunohistochemistry or with 7% Sudan Black in 70% ethanol for immunofluorescence.
After washing, the tissue was blocked with 5% ASB with 0.2% triton by one h and incubated overnight with primary antibodies against AHR (monoclonal MA1-514-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Z0334-DAKO, Real Carpinteria, CA, USA).
After washing the primary antibody, sections were incubated with a secondary antibody, Goat anti-Mouse (626520-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or Anti-Rabbit (C02-7074S -Cell Signalling, Danvers, MA, USA) for immunohistochemistry, and Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 for immunofluorescence, washed and mounted using Entellan for immunohistochemistry or Vectashield with DAPI for immunofluorescence.
Slides were examined with a Nikon Eclipse 801 (Nikon, Corporation, Japan).
We quantified the data through the Image J software (Rasband, 1997-2016, version 1.45) using three sections of each hippocampus sample from young (n = 7) and elder (n = 6) donors.
From each section, we took five micrographs of adjacent regions in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions in a total area of 17 mm 2 .
To discriminate between neuron and non-neuron cells, we manually counted the stained nuclei, taking into account size and morphology using decision-making algorithms and descriptions previously reported
We quantified GFAP as the total area stained, and AHR as the number of stained cells/number of total cells.
The results are shown as an average of the values obtained.
To test the cell type in which AHR was expressed, double immunofluorescence for AHR/GFAP was performed.
Images were captured with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
We show a representative micrograph taken from the observation of one section for AD patients (n = 3).

Blood Collection and Processing
Blood samples were collected and processed to obtain blood serum according to the NIA-AA guidelines for the standardization of preanalytical variables in the study of blood-based biomarkers in AD
Participants were requested to fast for at least eight hours before sample collection.
