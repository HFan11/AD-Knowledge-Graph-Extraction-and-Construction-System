Exercise-linked FNDC5/irisin rescues synaptic plasticity and memory defects in Alzheimer’s models
Defective brain hormonal signaling has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disorder characterized by synapse and memory failure.
Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine released upon cleavage of membrane-bound precursor protein FNDC5, also expressed in the hippocampus.
Here we show that FNDC5/irisin levels are reduced in AD hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid, and in experimental AD models.
Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impaired long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice.
Conversely, boosting brain levels of FNDC5/irisin rescued synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mouse models.
Peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin rescued memory impairment, whereas blockade of either peripheral or brain FNDC5/irisin attenuated the neuroprotective actions of physical exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice.
By showing that FNDC5/irisin is an important mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise in AD models, our findings place FNDC5/irisin as a novel agent capable of opposing synapse failure and memory impairment in AD.

Introduction
The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is increasing as the world population ages, with more than thirty-five million people now affected worldwide
There is no current effective treatment for AD
Consolidated evidence indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) is an important target for the actions of peripheral hormones, including insulin, leptin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucocorticoids and others
Insulin, leptin and GLP-1 stimulate neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and contribute to higher brain functions, including cognition
Failure of hormone-initiated signaling pathways has been associated with brain disorders, including AD
For example, brain insulin signaling is decreased in AD
Irisin was recently identified as a myokine released into the circulation upon physical exercise, and capable of stimulating adipocyte browning and thermogenesis in mice and humans
Irisin is cleaved from fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5), a transmembrane precursor protein expressed in muscle under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α).
FNDC5/irisin stimulates the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus
This raises the possibility that FNDC5/ irisin could play a neuroprotective role in brain disorders, such as AD.
Here, we investigated FNDC5/irisin levels in brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients and in mouse models of AD, and tested the hypothesis that FNDC5/irisin could be a key mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD models, thus holding promise as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in AD.

Results

Immunodetection of FNDC5/irisin in the brain
Since the original report
Part of the debate has focused on the specificity and identity of proteins identified using anti-FNDC5/irisin antibodies.
The existence and levels of irisin in human plasma have been settled using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analysis
Here, we first validated the rabbit polyclonal antibody we used (Abcam; anti-FNDC5, cat # ab131390) against recombinant irisin produced in CHO cells (Adipogen; cat # AG-40B-0136).
In agreement with recent reports
We note, nonetheless, that because irisin is derived from FNDC5, immunological approaches for detection of irisin inherently detect its precursor FNDC5 in samples where the latter is also present.
Moreover, irisin has been reported to exhibit an apparent molecular mass in the 22-32 kDa range resulting from dimerization and/or glycosylation
This is similar to the molecular mass of FNDC5
Thus, in the current study we refer to FNDC5/irisin when describing results based on immunological detection of irisin in brain tissue homogenates.
On the other hand, because irisin is thought to comprise the majority of secreted FNDC5/irisin
We used the anti-FNDC5 antibody to identify FNDC5/irisin in mouse hippocampal (Fig.
Immunoblots showed a band at 29 kDa, within the range reported for irisin, which migrated with similar electrophoretic mobility as recombinant irisin (Adipogen; cat # AG-40B-0136) (Fig.
Mass spectrometry analysis in this band identified a peptide with amino acid sequence DNEPNNNK, which is contained within FNDC5 (Extended Data Fig.
Based on mass spectrometry results and because this band (which we termed band 1) was detected at the same apparent molecular mass as recombinant irisin, we used this band for quantification of FNDC5/irisin levels in subsequent experiments.
In addition, we detected immunopositive bands at apparent molecular masses of ~ 40, 58 and 75 kDa (bands 2, 3 and 4, respectively; Fig.
To rule out the possibility that bands 2-4 could reflect non-specific antibody labeling, we analyzed them by mass spectrometry.
Results showed that bands 2 and 3 contained the same FNDC5 peptide as band 1.
An additional peptide (DEVTMKEMGR) identified in band 4 was also comprised within FNDC5/irisin (Extended Data Fig.
Results indicate the presence of different forms (e.g., multimers and/or post-translationally modified species) of FNDC5/irisin in immunoblots from brain homogenates.
FNDC5/irisin is reduced in AD brains and CSF, and in AD experimental models FNDC5/irisin was significantly reduced in the hippocampi of late-stage AD patients compared to age-matched early AD or cognitively normal subjects (Fig.
No changes were detected in βIII-tubulin (Tuj1), used as a neuron-specific control, indicating that the decrease in FNDC5/irisin was not caused by significant neuronal death in the samples analyzed (data not shown).
For CSF analysis of AD or control individuals, we employed an irisin ELISA kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; cat # EK-067-29), which robustly recognizes recombinant irisin (Extended Data Fig.
Irisin was decreased in the CSF of AD patients compared to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or non-demented controls (Fig.
Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients also presented reduced CSF levels of irisin (Fig.
No significant alterations were found in plasma levels of irisin in AD or LBD patients compared to non-demented controls (Fig.
CSF irisin levels showed a positive correlation with age in non-demented controls, but not in AD patients (Fig.
While no correlation was found between CSF and plasma irisin levels in controls or AD patients (Extended Data Fig.
We next sought to determine whether Aβ oligomers (AβOs), soluble Aβ aggregates that accumulate in AD brains and are linked to synapse failure and memory loss
Exposure of rat hippocampal cultures to AβOs (500 nM; 24 h), reduced FNDC5/irisin at both mRNA (Extended Data Fig.
FNDC5/irisin immunoreactivity was mostly associated with the surface of mature neurons (positively labeled for βIII-tubulin), with little immunoreactivity present in GFAP-positive astrocytes (Extended Data Fig.
FNDC5/irisin immunoreactivity was reduced in AβO-exposed hippocampal cultures (Extended Data Fig.
Specificity of surface staining by the anti-FNDC5 antibody was confirmed by our observation that lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown of FNDC5 markedly reduced its surface immunostaining (Extended Data Fig.
We next exposed cultured human adult cortical slices
Consistent with previous reports
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of AβOs (10 pmol in a single dose)
FNDC5/irisin protein levels detected by ELISA were reduced in the hippocampi of mice 24 h post-infusion of AβOs (Fig.
FNDC5/irisin levels were also reduced in the hippocampi of 13-16 month-old APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice (henceforth referred to as APP/PS1 ΔE9) (Fig.
Taken together, our results indicate that FNDC5/irisin is expressed in the hippocampus, and is reduced in AD brains and CSF, as well as in experimental models of AD.
Because FNDC5/irisin levels are controlled by PGC-1α
Expression of both PGC-1α (Extended Data Fig.
PGC-1α protein levels were also reduced 7d post-infusion (Extended Data Fig.

Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impairs synaptic plasticity and memory in mice
We infused C57BL/6 mice i.c.v. with lentiviruses harboring two different shRNA constructs that efficiently knockdown FNDC5 (Fig.
This resulted in impaired maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) (Fig.
Mice infected with a control lentiviral vector (harboring an shRNA targeting luciferase) exhibited normal performance in the NOR task (Fig.
Downregulation of brain FNDC5/irisin had no impact on performance in the radial arm water maze (RAWM) or contextual fear conditioning (CFC) tasks in WT mice (Fig.
Control experiments showed that lentivirus-infected mice had no significant differences in motor activity or body weight (Extended Data Fig.
Results thus indicate that while brain FNDC5/irisin does not contribute to CFC and RAWM memory, it influences hippocampal synaptic plasticity and NOR memory in C57BL/6 mice.

Boosting brain FNDC5/irisin levels rescues synapse plasticity and memory defects in mouse models of AD
We next observed that recombinant irisin rescued impaired LTP in AβO-exposed hippocampal slices (Fig.
Further, bilateral intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant irisin (75 pmol/site) prevented AβO-induced impairment in NOR and fear conditioning memory (Extended Data Fig.
To further explore whether FNDC5/irisin could counteract the direct impact of AβOs on memory
Six days post-infection, mice received a single i.c.v.
infusion of AβOs (or vehicle).
Control measurements showed that neither viral infection nor AβO infusion caused any changes in speed or distance traveled, or in time spent at the center or periphery in an open field test (data not shown), indicating lack of effects on locomotor activity and anxiety.
Brain expression of FNDC5/irisin blocked the AβO-induced alterations on both NOR (Fig.
Infection with AdFNDC5 led to increases in FNDC5/ irisin mRNA expression and protein levels in the cortex (Fig.
We further used a qPCR array to interrogate hippocampal gene expression related to synaptic plasticity in mice previously infected with either AdGFP or AdFNDC5, and subsequently infused with vehicle or AβOs.
Amongst 84 genes analyzed, AdFNDC5 rescued AβO-induced changes in expression of 6 genes, whose expression levels were independently validated by qPCR.
These genes included immediate early genes (Egr1, Egr4), and genes coding for the protein phosphatase calcineurin (Ppp3ca), neuronal pentraxin 2 (Nptx2), and subunits of AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gria2, Grm2) (Extended Data Fig.
We next i.c.v-infused APP/PS1 ƊE9 mice
Fourteen days post infection, after completion of behavioral experiments, acute hippocampal slices were prepared and CA3-CA1 synapses were stimulated for LTP induction.
While hippocampal slices from APP/PS1 ƊE9 mice infected with AdGFP exhibited impaired LTP (Fig.
Brain expression of FNDC5/irisin rescued memory impairment in APP/PS1 ƊE9 mice in both radial arm water maze (RAWM) (Fig.
Similar results in LTP, RAWM and CFC were obtained with APPswe/PS1 M146L mice (henceforth referred to as APP/PS1 M146L), another mouse model of AD
Control experiments showed that brain expression of FNDC5/irisin had no impact on locomotor activity, somatosensory behavior or body weight in APP/PS1 M146L mice (data not shown).
Overall, results indicate that expression of FNDC5/irisin rescued hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice.

Neuroprotective actions of recombinant irisin in vitro
Because abnormal eIF2α phosphorylation and inhibition of protein synthesis have been recently described as key mechanisms driving synapse damage and memory failure in AD models
Irisin prevented AβO-induced elevation in eIF2α-P and ATF4 (Extended Data Fig
Control measurements revealed that total eIF2α immunoreactivity remained unchanged (not shown).
We further found that recombinant irisin prevented dendritic spine loss in cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to AβOs (Extended Data Fig.
Additional experiments determined that recombinant irisin reduced AβO binding to neurons (Extended Data Fig.
In vitro binding studies revealed no direct interaction between AβOs and recombinant irisin (Extended Data Fig.
In addition, surface FNDC5/irisin and AβOs did not co-localize in dendrites of hippocampal neurons (Extended Data Fig.
Results further showed that FNDC5/irisin overexpression reduced hippocampal soluble Aβ 42 levels in APP/PS1 M146L mice (Extended Data Fig.
We found that recombinant irisin stimulated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in human cortical slices (Fig.
Recombinant irisin further increased cAMP and pCREB in mouse hippocampal slices (Fig.
Irisin-induced CREB phosphorylation was abolished by PKA inhibition with myristoylated PKI 14-22, a selective PKA inhibitor (Fig.
We further found that PKA activity mediated protection against nuclear translocation of ATF4 induced by AβOs (Fig.
Irisin further induced transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in cultured neurons (data not shown).
The effect of recombinant irisin was similar to forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase (data not shown).
Taken together, results provide initial clues into mechanisms by which recombinant irisin affords neuroprotection in experimental models of AD.

FNDC5/irisin mediates the protective actions of physical exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD models
From a translational perspective, physical exercise could be a non-pharmacological strategy to increase hippocampal FNDC5/irisin in patients at risk of developing AD or in patients already exhibiting cognitive impairment.
We thus initially tested whether a protocol of daily swimming (1 h/day, 5 d/week, 5 weeks) could protect mice from AβO-induced memory deficits and reduction in brain levels of FNDC5/irisin.
Notably, exercised mice were protected from AβO-induced impairment in NOR memory both 24 h (Extended Data Fig.
Protection against AβOinduced memory deficits was also verified in the CFC paradigm (Extended Data Fig.
We further found that this exercise protocol prevented AβO-induced reductions in FNDC5/ irisin mRNA (Extended Data Fig.
Moreover, consistent with a previous report
We then asked whether brain FNDC5/irisin mediated the beneficial effect of physical exercise on synapse plasticity in APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice.
We conducted an i.c.v.
infusion of a lentiviral vector harboring FNDC5 shRNA and subsequently subjected mice to the exercise protocol.
Results revealed that exercise improved LTP in APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice infused with an innocuous shRNA (targeting luciferase), but not in APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice exhibiting downregulated brain FNDC5/irisin expression (Fig.
Additionally, we observed that downregulation of brain FNDC5/irisin did not exacerbate LTP impairment in sedentary APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice (Fig.
We next aimed to determine a potential role of peripheral FNDC5/irisin in the brain.
We administered the AdFNDC5 vector into the caudal vein of mice to induce peripheral FNDC5/irisin expression, as previously described
Peripheral administration of AdFNDC5 rescued NOR memory defects in AβO-infused mice (Fig.
We next evaluated plasma levels of FNDC5/irisin in this group of mice and found unaltered levels in AβO-infused animals (Fig.
As expected, plasma levels of FNDC5/irisin were increased in animals that received i.v.
AdFNDC5 (Fig.
Moreover, while hippocampal levels of FNDC5/irisin were decreased in AβO-infused mice, intravenous injection of AdFNDC5 resulted in increased hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels and prevented the decrease triggered by AβOs (Fig.
These results suggest that peripheral FNDC5/irisin can either reach the brain or trigger an increase in brain FNDC5/irisin.
They further demonstrate that peripheral FNDC5/ irisin affords protection against AβO-induced memory impairment.
Our second approach to investigate the role of peripheral FNDC5/irisin in synaptic plasticity and memory in AD models consisted in neutralizing peripheral FNDC5/irisin.
To this end, we carried out intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of anti-FNDC5 in either sedentary or exercised AβO-infused mice.
This approach has been previously described to attenuate irisin-induced expression of pro-thermogenesis genes in mice
Interestingly, i.p. administration of anti-FNDC5 blocked the protective actions of physical exercise against the impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory induced by AβOs (Fig.
We further noted that i.p. administration of the anti-FNDC5 antibody per se impaired synaptic plasticity and performance in the NOR test (Fig.
We next aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise and peripheral administration of anti-FNDC5 on hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels.
In accordance with results in Extended Data Fig.
Interestingly, we observed that administration of anti-FNDC5 led to a decrease in hippocampal FNDC5/ irisin levels in exercised AβO-infused mice (Fig.
Collectively these results indicate that peripheral irisin may reach the brain and mediate the neuroprotective actions of exercise in synaptic plasticity and memory in AD.
Lastly, we tested whether the approach to neutralize peripheral FNDC5/irisin using an anti-FNDC5 antibody would block the beneficial effects of exercise on memory in APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice.
Our results showed that peripheral administration of the anti-FNDC5 antibody prevented the protective actions of exercise in APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice in the NOR test (Fig.
Collectively, these results importantly demonstrate that FNDC5/irisin mediates the positive effects of exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory.

Discussion
AD is a neurological disorder primarily affecting memory, and with no cure to date.
A variety of potential underlying mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of AD
Considerable evidence indicates that memory impairment in AD is caused by synapse failure and loss
Thus, therapies aimed at restoring or preserving synapse function and cognition are highly warranted.
Irisin was originally discovered as an exercise-induced myokine that shifts the adipose metabolism toward a thermogenic profile
There has been some debate as to the nature and identity of FNDC5/irisin, as well as to its functional relevance in humans
While concerns have been expressed regarding lack of specificity of anti-irisin antibodies
Three complementary lines of evidence indicate the specificity of the anti-FNDC5 antibody and ELISA kit used in the current work:
(1) FNDC5/irisin levels detected by ELISA showed the expected increase or decrease, respectively, when FNDC5/irisin was overexpressed by use of an adenoviral vector (in both brain and circulation) or when it was knocked down in the brain using a lentiviral vector; (2) surface labeling of FNDC5/irisin by anti-FNDC5 in cultured neurons was predictably reduced in neurons infected by a lentiviral vector harboring shRNA to knock down FNDC5/ irisin; (3) mass spectrometry analysis identified peptides contained within FNDC5 in excised gel bands that were immunolabeled by the anti-FNDC5 antibody.
By coupling immunodetection and mass spectrometry, we offer initial evidence that FNDC5/irisin is present in multiple forms with distinct apparent molecular weights in the brain, suggesting it may undergo post-translational modifications and/or exist in different aggregation states.
Indeed, putative glycosylation sites are present in FNDC5/irisin
An interesting study demonstrated that FNDC5/irisin is induced via PGC-1α in the mouse brain, and promotes BDNF expression
Extending those previous findings and arguing for a physiological role of FNDC5/irisin in the human brain, we show that ex vivo human adult cortical slices express FNDC5/irisin and respond to exogenous recombinant irisin by activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB memory pathway
Our in vitro findings further show that irisin blocks AβO-binding to neurons and prevents AβO-induced eIF2α-P and inhibition of protein synthesis.
We and others have recently described these events as essential for synapse and memory failure in AD models, thereby pinpointing a potential downstream pathway by which irisin preserves memory
We note that the cellular receptor(s) for irisin remain(s) to be identified, which limits current knowledge on downstream signaling mechanisms.
The identification of the irisin receptor (s) and the detailed signaling mechanisms triggered in the periphery and in the brain are needed in the field.
The reduced brain and CSF levels of FNDC5/irisin in AD patients and in animal models reported here supports the notion that defective brain hormonal signaling in AD impact mechanisms related to memory formation and brain function
It is noteworthy that we found a positive correlation between age and CSF irisin in control, non-demented subjects, but not in MCI and AD patients, suggesting that the increase in brain FNDC5/irisin with aging may be part of an endogenous mechanism to cope with the many challenges faced by the aging brain.
Irisin was reduced in the CSF of AD patients, but not in plasma, indicating a specific decrease in the CNS.
Our finding that hippocampal FNDC5/irisin is reduced in moderate/ late AD, but not in MCI, suggests that decreased FNDC5/irisin is not a likely cause of early cognitive impairment in AD, but may contribute to memory defects as disease progresses.
Additional studies measuring irisin levels in the CSF during healthy aging and in patients with other neurological disorders are anticipated, and will help to determine when irisin levels decrease during the course of AD.
Blockade of either brain or peripheral FNDC5/irisin in mice impaired LTP and NOR memory, implicating FNDC5/irisin in physiological memory processes.
However, future studies are warranted to address the precise physiological roles of brain and peripheral FNDC5/irisin in the formation and consolidation of different types of memories.
It is noteworthy that peripheral administration of the AdFNDC5 led to increases in hippocampal FNDC5/irisin and protected mice against memory impairment induced by AβOs.
Most importantly, peripheral FNDC5/irisin is implicated in the preservation of hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels, synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice.
Collectively, these results provide mechanistic information on the beneficial actions of FNDC5/irisin in the brain and suggest that a crosstalk between peripheral and central FNDC5/irisin influences synaptic plasticity and memory in mice.
Physical exercise has been previously shown to induce memory-related events in the brain
Many efforts to identify endogenous molecules responsible for the beneficial effects of exercise are underway.
Brain PGC-1α and BDNF
Results presented here add FNDC5/irisin to this list.
Our findings suggest that FNDC5/irisin could comprise an attractive novel therapy aimed to prevent dementia in patients at risk, as well as to delay its progression in patients at later stages, including those who no longer can exercise.
Many patients with dementia are disabled due to other age-related conditions or comorbidities (e.g., arthritis, heart disease, obesity, visual problems, depression) that preclude them from engaging in regular physical exercise.
Therefore, the development of alternative approaches that build upon the beneficial effects of exercise in the brain may benefit those patients.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that FNDC5/irisin levels are reduced in human AD brains and CSF as well as in AD mouse models, and that boosting either brain or peripheral FNDC5/irisin levels attenuates synaptic and memory impairments in AD mouse models.
We further show that FNDC5/irisin is a novel mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on synapse function and memory in AD models.
Bolstering brain FNDC5/irisin levels, either pharmacologically or through exercise, may thus constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to protect/repair synapse function and prevent cognitive decline in AD.

NanoLC-LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis of immunodetected FNDC5/irisin in mouse hippocampus
Mouse hippocampal homogenates (50 μg per lane) were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels followed by electrotransfer of half of the gel (first 6 lanes) onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4 o C, constant 100 V for 90 minutes in Tris/Glycine transfer buffer (BioRad, cat #1610734) containing 20% (v/v) methanol.
Blots were blocked in membrane blocking solution (Invitrogen, cat # 000105) for 1 hour at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 o C with anti-FNDC5 polyclonal antibody (Abcam; catalog # ab131390; 1:1,000 dilution in blocking buffer), washed 3 times for 10 minutes with TBS-T, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen; 1:50,000 dilution in blocking buffer), developed using Pierce™ ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged on a Azure c600 (Azure Biosystems) imaging station.
The positions of immunolabeled bands in the membranes were used to guide excision of the corresponding bands from unstained separate lanes from the other half of the gel (mirror) that had not been electrotransferred.
Excised gel bands were subjected to in-gel digestion as described
Commercial recombinant irisin expressed in CHO cells (Adipogen, cat #AG-40B-0136) digested in aqueous solution or digested/eluted from bands excised from an SDS-PAGE gel (run exactly as described above) were used as standards.
Mass spectrometry analyses were carried out at the Queen's University (Kingston, ON, Canada) Mass Spectrometry facility.

Alternatively, we manually searched for MS2 spectra corresponding to specific m/z values for peptides identified in recombinant irisin standards in the raw data for samples corresponding to each band excised from the SDS-PAGE gel.

Ex vivo human cortical slices
Adult human cortical slices were previously characterized, and were prepared as described
Healthy cortical tissue was obtained from patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy subjected to surgical interventions for removal of epileptic foci.
Donors were two males (aged 37 and 49 year-old) and three female (aged 18, 39 and 66 year-old).
After dissection under sterile conditions, 400 μm-thick slices were prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper and plated on Neurobasal A medium containing 2% B27, 500 μM glutamine, 5 ng/mL FGF2, 2 μM DHEAS, 1 ng/mL BDNF and 50 μg/ml gentamicin.
After 7 days in culture at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 , slices were exposed to AβOs (500 nM) or the corresponding volume of vehicle for 12 h, and were processed for biochemical analyses thereafter.
When present, irisin (25 nM) was added for the indicated time periods, and tissue was harvested for subsequent analyses.

Post-mortem human brain tissue
For Western blotting analyses, brain samples from non-cognitively impaired, early or late AD subjects (defined by combined pathological and cognitive assessment) were obtained from the University of Kentucky (UK) Alzheimer's Disease Center biobank.
Experimental procedures involving human tissue were in compliance with the UK Institutional Review board (IRB).
Samples from Brodmann areas 21/22 (superior and mid-temporal gyri) were snap-frozen at autopsy as previously described.
AD tissue was from symptomatic individuals with clinical and pathological features described in Supplementary Table
All subjects were categorized by MMSE as control (26-30), early AD (20-25), and late AD (13-17).
Sample groups were separated so as to clearly define differences in content of proteins of interest and MMSE score.

Human cerebrospinal fluid and plasma
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma from control and AD patients were collected after extensive neuropsychological investigation supervised by a board-certified psychiatrist, as described
The study cohort included males and females.
Age (mean ± SD), in years, was distributed as follows: Controls (67.5 ± 4.9), MCI (71.5 ± 5.8), AD (72.5 ± 8.1), and LBD (71.6 ± 7.0).
CSF was collected by lumbar puncture performed at 9AM in all cases.
CSF was centrifuged, aliquoted and immediately frozen at -80 o C. Total blood was collected in heparin-coated tubes, and plasma was isolated by centrifugation.
Irisin concentration was determined using a commercial ELISA kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), according to manufacturer's instructions.

Animals
Male C57BL/6 or Swiss mice were obtained from the animal facility at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and were 2.5-3 month-old at the beginning of experiments.
Male and female APPswe/PS1 ΔE9 mice on a C57BL/6 background
Male and female double transgenic mice (APP/PS1 M146L) were obtained by crossing Tg2576 mice harboring mutant human APP (K670M:N671L) with mutant PS1 (M146L) mice
Wild-type littermates were used as controls.
All animals had their genotypes confirmed prior to use.
Animals were housed in groups of five per cage with free access to food and water, under a 12 h light/dark cycle, with controlled room temperature and humidity.
Experiments using C57BL/6 mice are presented in the main text, while biochemical and behavioral experiments in Swiss mice performed to validate and confirm our findings are presented as Extended Data Figures.
All procedures followed the "Principles of Laboratory Animal Care" from the US National Institutes of Health.

Brain infusions in mice
For intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of AβOs, mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane (Cristália; São Paulo, Brazil) using a vaporizer system (Norwell, MA) and were gently restrained only during the injection procedure, as described
A 2.5 mm-long needle was unilaterally inserted 1 mm to the right of the midline point equidistant from each eye and 1 mm posterior to a line drawn through the anterior base of the eye
10 pmol AβOs (or vehicle) was injected in a final volume of 3 μL and the needle was kept in place for an additional 30 seconds to prevent backflow.
Mice that showed signs of misplaced injections or any sign of hemorrhage were excluded from further analysis.
Recombinant irisin (75 pmol per site) was bilaterally delivered into the hippocampal CA1 region (stereotaxical coordinates relative to Bregma: 2.0 mm AP, ± 1.5 mm ML, 1.5 mm DV), immediately before AβO injections.
Adenoviral particles (1×10 8 ) harboring GFP (AdGFP) or FNDC5 (AdFNDC5) constructs were stereotaxically injected into the right lateral ventricle of WT C57BL/6 or APP/PS1 mice (coordinates relative to Bregma: 0.2 mm AP; 1.0 ML; 2.4 mm DV).
Injections were performed in a volume of 2 μL infused over 30 s. Behavioral studies (see below) were carried out at least 6 days post injection.
Lentiviral particles expressing shRNA against murine Fndc5 or Luciferase (control) were i.c.v.-injected as described above.
Lentiviruses (titer of 1.0-2.0
× 10 9 particles/mL) were injected in a volume of 3 μL per animal.
Behavioral and electrophysiological studies were carried out 4 weeks post-injections.
AdFNDC5 or AdGFP (100 μL; 10 6 particles/μL) were i.v.-injected into the caudal vein six days prior to AβO infusions in mice anesthetized by isoflurane (2.5%) and gently restrained during the procedure.

Aerobic exercise in mice
Swiss mice were adapted to swimming for 10 min each day for 2 days to reduce waterinduced stress.
The duration of exercise was gradually increased until mice swam for 60 min, which was reached, on average, on the fifth day of training.
Exercise sessions were performed during the light cycle and consisted of 60 min swimming sessions, 5 days per week for 5 weeks.
Mice swam in groups of four in plastic barrels (60 cm depth × 45 cm diameter).
Water temperature was maintained at ~ 24 °C.
On the fifth week of training, animals were injected i.c.v. with AβOs (10 pmol) and the novel object recognition task (see below) was performed 24 h or 5 days post-injection of AβOs.
Contextual fear conditioning (see below) was performed 6-7 days post-injection.
Animals were euthanized by decapitation 1 h after the last test session.
Since C57BL/6 are smaller than Swiss mice and less resistant to long exercise sessions, we adapted the protocol when using those mice.
In a set of experiments, WT or APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice on a C57BL/6 background swam for 20 min for three weeks in groups of four before LTP recordings.
In some experiments, WT C57BL/6 mice underwent exercise and were injected i.p. with anti-FNDC5 antibody or control IgG (5 mg) after the last two exercise sessions, and/or were infused i.c.v. with AβOs (10 pmol) in the last exercise session.
Mice were assessed in the NOR test 24 h after oligomer injections.
Alternatively, in experiments aimed at testing NOR memory, WT or APP/PS1 ΔE9 were subjected to daily swimming sessions for one week, and were injected i.p. with anti-FNDC5 antibody or non-specific IgG (5 μg) on the first, fourth and seventh days.
NOR was performed 24 h after the last exercise session.

Behavioral Testing

Novel object recognition (NOR).-Object recognition tests were carried out in an open
field arena measuring 0.3 (w) x 0.3 (d) x 0.45 (h) m, as described
Total distance and velocity during the 5-minute open field session were recorded as measures of locomotor activity, and no differences were found among groups.
Animals were trained in a 5 minutelong session during which they were placed at the center of the arena in the presence of two identical objects.
Exploratory behavior (amount of time exploring each object) was recorded by trained researchers.
One hour after training, animals were reinserted into the arena for the test session, in which one of the objects had been replaced by a different (novel) object.
Again, the amounts of time spent exploring familiar and novel objects were measured.
Animals that had a total exploration time below 10 (ten) seconds were excluded from NOR tests.
Results are expressed as percentage of time exploring each object during the training or test session, and were analyzed using a one-sample Student's t-test comparing the mean exploration time for each object with the fixed value of 50% (chance level).
Contextual fear conditioning.-Contextual
fear conditioning was evaluated as described
For experiments in APP/PS1 mice, animals were allowed to freely explore the conditioning chamber (0.4 × 0.25 × 0.3 m) for 2 min, after which a 2-sec shock stimulus (0.8 mA) was applied to the floor.
Animals remained in the cage for 1 additional minute.
After 24 h, mice were placed in the same cage and allowed to explore it for 5 min in the absence of electric shock.
Freezing events were recorded during this period, and the percentage of time in freezing behavior was calculated for each animal by the Ethovision software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA).
In experiments with irisin-or AdFNDC5-injected mice and corresponding controls, animals were allowed to freely explore the training chamber (0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 m; Harvard Apparatus) for 3 minutes, after which they received two 2sec long 0.35 mA foot-shocks with a 30 sec interval.
Animals were removed from the cage after 30 s. Twenty-four hours thereafter, they were reinserted into the box for 5 min and total freezing time during test session was determined.
Statistical significances of differences between groups were evaluated by two-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test.
Representative experiments are shown in the figures.
After completion of fear conditioning experiments, animals were subjected to sensory threshold assessment to investigate potentially different susceptibilities to shock, and no significant differences in sensory response were found amongst experimental groups.

Two-day radial arm water maze (RAWM).
-RAWM was performed in APP/PS1 mice as described
Briefly, mice were tested for their ability to find a platform located in a defined arm of a six-arm maze along 30 trials in two days.
At day 1, 5 training blocks were performed with alternation between visible and hidden platform.
On day 2, all 5 blocks had the platform hidden.
A training block comprises 3 trials of 60 s each.
The number of entries into incorrect maze arms (errors) was recorded for each session, and the number of errors per block was averaged.
Visual and motor abilities were assessed by recording swimming velocity and latency to reach a visible platform in an open swimming pool task.

Animal tracking was automatically performed by Ethovision software (Noldus).-Open field. Control experiment to assess locomotor and exploratory activity
were performed in the same boxes as NOR, in which mice were allowed to freely move for min.
Total distance, mean velocity, percentage of time in the center or periphery were recorded and quantified using the ANY-maze software (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL).

LTP measurements
Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation, and their hippocampi were immediately removed.
Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were cut, placed on infusion chambers on aCSF (124 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM KCl, 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 25 mM NaHCO 3 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose) and allowed to recover for 90-120 min.
For experiments with recombinant irisin and/or AβOs in slices from WT mice, AβOs (200 nM) and/or recombinant irisin (25 nM) were diluted in aCSF and perfused for min before stimulus.
For experiments with exercised mice that received anti-FNDC5 (or not), animals were exercised for three sessions and received an i.p. injection of anti-FNDC5 antibody (or non-specific IgG) after each session.
An additional anti-FNDC5 injection was performed before slice preparation and perfusion with AβOs or vehicle.
For experiments with adenovirus-mediated FNDC5 expression, WT or APP/PS1 ΔE9 mice were i.c.v.injected with AdGFP (control) or AdFNDC5 14 days prior to euthanasia and slice preparation.
Field EPSPs were recorded from hippocampal CA1 region according to established procedures

Aβ oligomers
Oligomers were prepared from synthetic Aβ 1-42 and were routinely characterized by sizeexclusion chromatography, as described
For electrophysiology experiments in hippocampal slices, oligomers were prepared as previously reported

Mature hippocampal cultures
Primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies, CA), glutamine, and antibiotics according to established procedures
Cultures were exposed to 500 nM Aβ oligomers or an equivalent volume of vehicle (2% DMSO in PBS) for the time intervals indicated in each experiment.
When present, lentiviral vectors targeting FNDC5 (10 6 /mL) were allowed to express for five days before cells were processed for immunocytochemistry.
When present, recombinant irisin (25 nM) or forskolin (10 μM) was added to cultures 15 min before AβOs, and myristoylated PKI 14-22 (1 μM) was added 40 minutes before irisin.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde plus 4% sucrose for 10 min.
AβO-sensitive (NU4 monoclonal antibody
Nuclei were counterstained in DAPIcontaining Prolong mounting solution.
Coverslips were imaged on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope.
FNDC5, eIF2α-P, total eIF2α and ATF4 immunofluorescence intensities were each analyzed in at least 3 experiments (see Figure
In each experiment, 20-30 images (from 2-3 coverslips) were acquired from each experimental condition.
Histogram analysis of fluorescence at each pixel across the images was performed using NIH Image J 66 , as described
When indicated, cell bodies were digitally removed from the images so that only immunostaining on dendritic processes was quantified.
Statistical significances of differences between experimental groups were assessed by ANOVA followed by post-hoc Holm-Sidak test, and p-values are indicated in Figure

Spine density
After treatments, hippocampal neuronal cultures were fixed in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde plus 4% sucrose for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min.
Cells were then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1h and stained with Alexa-conjugated Phalloidin (2 U per coverslip), which labels F-actin, in 3% BSA for 2 h at room temperature.
Coverslips were mounted in DAPI-containing Prolong Gold and stored in a dark and humid chamber overnight.
Coverslips were imaged on a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope.
Images were obtained from at least two coverslips per experimental condition for each experiment (three experiments with independent neuronal cultures).
Two or three distal dendrite segments were isolated per neuron, and a researcher blind to experimental conditions manually determined the number of spines.
Results are expressed as the mean number of spines per μm.

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultures or animal tissues using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, CA), following manufacturer instructions.
RNA from human brain tissue was extracted using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).
Purity and integrity of RNA preparations were checked by the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio.
Only preparations with 260/280 nm OD ratios higher than 1.8 and no signs of RNA degradation were used.
RNA concentrations were determined by absorption at 260 nm.
For qRT-PCR, one microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, CA).
Quantitative expression analysis of target genes was performed on a 7500 Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Real-Time PCR system with the Power SYBR Green kit.
β-actin (actb) was used as an endogenous reference gene for data normalization.
qRT-PCR was performed in 20 μL reaction volumes according to manufacturer's protocols.
Primer sequences are described in Supplementary Table
Statistical significance of changes in expression was assessed using Student's ttest or 2-way ANOVA, as indicated in Figure

PCR array
A PCR array kit (Qiagen, Germany; catalog # PAM126Z) was used to assess expression of 84 genes involved in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, using cDNA obtained from hippocampi of AdFNDC5-infected (or AdGFP-infected) mice subsequently infused i.c.v. with AβOs (or vehicle).
Hippocampi were dissected 7 days after AβO injection.
The assay was conducted following manufacturer's instructions, and results were initially analyzed using Volcano plots.
Independent validation of differentially expressed genes was carried out by qPCR.
Statistical significance of changes in expression was assessed using 2-way ANOVA.

Immunoblotting and in vitro plate binding assay
Hippocampi or mature hippocampal cultures were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails, and were resolved on 4-20% polyacrylamide pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) with Tris/glycine/SDS buffer run at 200 V for 60 min at room temperature.
The gel (30 μg total protein/lane) was electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose using 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3, at 350 mA for 90 min at 4 °C.
Membranes were blocked with commercial blocking solution (Licor) for 1 h at room temperature.
For experiments with blocking peptide, anti-FNDC5 antibody was pre-incubated with molar ratio excess of recombinant irisin (5:1 or 10:1) for 3 h at room tempetature before incubation with membranes.
Primary antibodies (anti-FNDC5, antisynaptophysin, anti-PSD95 (1:1000), anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies (1:20,000)) were diluted in blocking solution and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 o C.

Protein synthesis (SuNSET)
Non-radioactive metabolic labeling by puromycin incorporation was performed for detection of newly synthesized peptides, as described
Briefly, hippocampal cultures were exposed to 1 μM puromycin for 30 min before experimental endpoints and harvested in RIPA buffer.
Puromycin incorporation, used as a proxy of protein synthesis rate, was detected using 12D10 anti-puromycin antibody (1:20,000).
Densitometric analysis was performed in whole lanes (from 10 to 180 kDa), and β-actin was used as a loading control.

Determination of cAMP levels
cAMP was measured radiometrically, as previously described
Briefly, human cortical slices were exposed to irisin (25 nM; 45 min) in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 500μM) added 30 min prior to irisin.

ELISA
Tissue samples were homogenized in 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails.
Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, collected in heparin-coated low protein-adsorption plastic tubes, centrifuged, and plasma fractions were either freshly used for ELISA or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 o C until analysis.
Soluble Aβ 42 was measured in the supernatant, while insoluble Aβ 42 was recovered by re-homogenizing the pellet in 6M guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h.
Aβ 42 , BDNF, cAMP, CREB and irisin ELISA assays were performed according to kit manufacturer's instructions, after sample dilution optimization.
