PQM130, a Novel Feruloyl–Donepezil Hybrid Compound, Effectively Ameliorates the Cognitive Impairments and Pathology in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent type of dementia in older people.
The complex nature of AD calls for the development of multitarget agents addressing key pathogenic processes.
Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is a first-line acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for the treatment of AD.
Although several studies have demonstrated the symptomatic efficacy of donepezil treatment in AD patients, the possible effects of donepezil on the AD process are not yet known.
In this study, a novel feruloyl-donepezil hybrid compound (PQM130) was synthesized and evaluated as a multitarget drug candidate against the neurotoxicity induced by Aβ 1-42 oligomer (AβO) injection in mice.
Interestingly, PQM130 had already shown anti-inflammatory activity in different in vivo models and neuroprotective activity in human neuronal cells.
The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of AβO in mice caused the increase of memory impairment, oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation.
Instead, PQM130 (0.5-1 mg/kg) treatment after the i.c.v.
AβO injection reduced oxidative damage and neuroinflammation and induced cell survival and protein synthesis through the modulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2).
Moreover, PQM130 increased brain plasticity and protected mice against the decline in spatial cognition.
Even more interesting is that PQM130 modulated different pathways compared to donepezil, and it is much more effective in counteracting AβO damage.
Therefore, our findings highlighted that PQM130 is a potent multi-functional agent against AD and could act as a promising neuroprotective compound for anti-AD drug development.

INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization estimated the presence of 47.5 million people worldwide with dementia in 2015 and predicted that the number of patients will be almost tripled by 2050 (
Mainly owing to significant increases in lifespan, dementia represents one of the major global health crises of the 21st century.
The most widespread form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD).
AD is a lethal neurodegenerative illness that begins with brain alterations more than 20 years before the clinical symptoms
This multifaceted and progressive neurodegenerative disease is pathologically characterized by the amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in amyloid plaques and the hyperphosphorylation of tau in neurofibrillary tangles, followed by a consistent neuronal loss leading to brain atrophy and dementia.
Although scientific research has changed course from fibrillar Aβ, implicated in plaque formation, to soluble Aβ, whose accumulation is probably the cause of the early synaptic dysfunction
Levels of soluble Aβ oligomers (AβO) have been shown in several experimental models to potently inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), increase dendritic spine loss, and impair cognition in mice
Although AD progression is tightly connected to Aβ aggregation, the scientific consensus is quite firm in suggesting that several other factors likely contribute to the development of AD.
Such factors include loss of cholinergic transmission, mitochondrial dysfunction, progressive oxidative damage, excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammatory processes, which may trigger a "domino" cascade of events leading to manifestation of AD
It is likely that AD begins as a synaptic disorder and decreased synaptic activity is one of the best pathological signal of cognitive decline in AD
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a pleiotropic growth factor in the brain, and it plays a crucial role in the survival and neuronal function
Indeed, not only can it modulate synapse formation and neurogenesis, but it can also reduce oxidative stress and cell death.
In the early stage of AD, the levels of the precursor form of BDNF, mature BDNF, or its mRNA are reduced in the parietal cortex and hippocampus
There is currently no cure for AD.
Unfortunately, the AD clinical trials targeting Aβ to date have been unsuccessful, demonstrating the need to investigate innovative therapeutic approaches beyond Aβ, and trying to focus attention on other early key events, in particular synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, or the early events of neuroinflammation
Thus, it is likely reasonable to argue that multifactorial diseases, such as AD, cannot be successfully treated by modulating a single target, but they will require multitarget drug treatment to address the different pathological facets of these diseases.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and N-methyl-daspartate antagonists are the current therapies for AD-related symptoms with poor efficacy and no evidence of disease modification
Donepezil is a highly centrally selective, reversible, and non-competitive AChE inhibitor and currently the most frequently prescribed drug for the treatment of AD.
Clinical trials with donepezil have highlighted slight but reproducible improvements in cognitive function of the treated patients as compared to placebo.
However, these effects were transient because cognitive function continued to decline over time in patients
As a consequence of the failure of one target-one ligand approach to provide promising results in AD treatment, new findings suggested that one molecule hitting multiple targets could represent the winning strategy to treat complex diseases
Thus, "the multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) approach is based on the design of new scaffolds with different pharmacophoric subunits connected in a single molecule, which could modulate multiple molecular targets at the same time"
Considering the MTDL approach, we studied here the activity of the multitarget ligand PQM130 (Figure
Ferulic acid is one of the degradation products of curcumin, which has already shown neuroprotective activities probably due to its ability to modify the kinetics of Aβ fibril formation, as well as to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities
The multitarget ligand PQM130 has already been investigated for its in vitro anticholinesterase, metal-chelating, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, in different in vivo models
Moreover, PQM130 also highlighted an interesting pharmacokinetic profile from the in silico evaluation of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination (ADME) parameters, using the software QikProp 3.1 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA; see Supplementary Material 1)
Interestingly, ADME data of PQM130 showed a good human absorption and blood-brain barrier penetration in accordance with the software reference parameters
A similar in silico approach was adopted to evaluate the PQM130 safety, using the VEGA platform (
Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milan, Italy), which includes various QSAR models.
In particular, mutagenicity (CONSENSUS) and carcinogenicity (IRFMN/ANTARES) models reported the absence of mutagenic and carcinogen effects of PQM130 (see Supplementary Material 2 and 3).
In the current study, we have further examined the neuroprotective effects of the multitarget ligand PQM130 in comparison also to donepezil in a mouse AD model generated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Aβ 1-42 oligomers (Aβ 1-42 O) and discussed the molecular mechanisms with particular attention to its nootropic, neuroprotective, and neurotrophic activities.

Animals
Adult male C57Bl/6 mice (9 weeks old, 25-30 g body weight; Harlan, Milan, Italy) were utilized.
The mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room (23-24°C) with free access to food and water and presented with 12 h light/12 h dark cycles.
Briefly, procedures on the mice were carried out according to the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU and the current Italian Law on the welfare of the laboratory animal (D.Lgs.
n.26/2014).
The animal protocol was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (Authorization No. 291/2017-PR) and by the corresponding committee at the University of Bologna.
The number of experimental animals was minimized and care was taken to limit mice suffering.

Experimental Design
The animals were randomized into five groups (n = 10/group): Sham/VH, Aβ/VH, Aβ/DON, Aβ/PQM130 0.5 mg/kg, and Aβ/ PQM130 1.0 mg/kg.
Four groups were treated with Aβ 1-42 O by a unilateral i.c.v.
injection, while the other received a unilateral i.c.v.
injection of saline solution (sham group).
One hour after the brain lesion, mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment of 1 mg/kg of donepezil hydrochloride (DON, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 or 1 mg/kg of PQM130, or vehicle (VH, saline).
The dose injected was selected according to the literature
We treated the mice daily for 10 days.
At the conclusion of the treatment period, the mice underwent behavioral assessment.
After the behavioral analysis, the animals were deeply anesthetized before being sacrificed by cervical dislocation to collect the samples for immunohistochemical and neurochemical analysis (for experimental design, see Figure

Aβ 1-42 Oligomers Preparation and Injection
Aβ 1-42 peptides (AnaSpec) were solubilized to 1 mg/ml in hexafluoroisopropanol before being sonicated and lyophilized at room temperature.
The unaggregated Aβ 1-42 film obtained was dissolved to a final concentration of 1 mM with sterile dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at -20°C until use.
The Aβ 1-42 O were prepared according to the protocol of
Briefly, to enhance oligomer formation, the Aβ 1-42 stock was diluted in saline buffer at 40 μM and incubated for 48 h at 4°C
Six microliters of Aβ 1-42 O (40 μM) were injected i.c.v., using a stereotaxic mouse frame (myNeuroLab, Leica-Microsystems Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and a 10-µL Hamilton syringe, at a rate of 0.5 ml/min.
After the injection, the needle was left in place for a few minutes before being retracted slowly and the wound was cleaned and sutured.
The sham mice received the corresponding volume of saline.
The following coordinates were used: anteroposterior: +0.22, mediolateral: +1.0, dorsoventral: -2.5, with a flat skull position.

Donepezil Hydrochloride and PQM130 Preparations
Donepezil hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and PQM130 (purity 98% by HPLC) was synthesized and provided by Professor Claudio Viegas Jr from the PeQuiM-Laboratory of Research in Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas (Alfenas, MG, Brazil).
Briefly, the powders were solubilized and aliquoted in sterilized saline (donepezil) or in dimethyl sulfoxide (PQM130).
The work solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (donepezil and PQM130) and 0.05 mg/ml (PQM130) in sterilized saline.
Animals were daily i.p. injected with 1 mg/kg solution (donepezil and PQM130) or 0.5 mg/kg (PQM130) for 10 days.

Behavioral Analysis
All the tests were performed between 9.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m.
All scores were attributed by a blinded observer.

Morris Water Maze (MWM)
The test was performed as described previously
Briefly, the apparatus was a circular plastic tank (1.0 m diameter, 50 cm height) filled with water and milk (22°C), and a submerged platform (1.5 cm under the water surface) positioned in the center of one of the four quadrants of the maze.
A camera was placed to register mice's movements and send data to an automated tracking system (EthoVision, Noldus, The Netherlands).
For each training trial, animals were placed into the pool at one of the four positions selected randomly, and the latency to find the hidden platform was recorded.
Mice that could not reach the platform within 60 s were guided to it by the experimenter.
After the trial, each mouse was placed under a warming lamp in a holding cage for 25 s until the next trial.
Training trials were conducted four times a day for 5 days.
On day 6, the platform was removed and animals were allowed to swim freely for 60 s.
The parameters measured during the probe trial were escape latency, frequency in the platform zone, and time spent in the opposite quadrant to the platform zone.

Y-Maze Test
The spatial working memory was evaluated by recording spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze as described earlier
Briefly, each arm of the maze [Ugo Basile ® S.r.L., Gemonio (VA), Italy] was 35 cm long, 15 cm high, and 5 cm wide and converged to a 120° angle.
The mice were positioned at the end of the A arm and allowed to move freely through the maze for 5 min.
The entry in all three arms consecutively was counted as an alternation.
Thus, the number of maximum alternations was calculated as the total number of arm entries minus two and the percentage of alternation was calculated as (actual alternations/ maximum alternations) × 100

Tissue Preparation for Immunohistochemistry and Neurochemical Analysis
At the end of behavioral tests, the mice were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed by cervical dislocation.
The brains were quickly removed and one hemisphere of each mouse was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 48 h.
The other hemispheres were immediately removed, and the hippocampi were isolated on ice and transferred to liquid nitrogen.
For the protein extraction, the tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer and the cytoplasmic protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method

Determination of Caspase-9 and -3 Activations
Caspase-9 and -3 enzyme activities were measured according to
Briefly, the tissue lysates were incubated with the assay buffer and a 50 mmol/L concentration of chromogenic p-nitroaniline (pNA) substrate (caspase-9, Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-pNA; caspase-3, Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-pNa; Alexis Biochemicals).
Each sample was incubated for 3 h at 37°C and the amount of pNA released was measured with a microplate reader (GENios, TECAN ® , Mannedorf, Switzerland) at 405 nm.
The values were expressed as the mean ± SEM of optical density (OD) of each experimental group.

Determination of Cellular Redox Status
The redox status, in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, was evaluated by measuring the oxidation of DCFH-DA to 2′7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF)
The samples (60 μl) were incubated for 30 min with 2 mg/ ml of DCFH-DA, and the conversion into the fluorescent product DCF was measured (excitation at 485 nm, emission at 535 nm) using a microplate reader (GENios, TECAN ® ).
The values were normalized to protein content and expressed as the mean ± SEM of fluorescence intensity arbitrary units (UF) of each experimental group.

Determination of Glutathione Content
Glutathione (GSH) content was assessed using the protocol described earlier
Briefly, samples were deproteinized with 4% sulfosalicylic acid, and the supernatants were added to 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (4 mg/ml).
The developed coloration was read quickly at 412 nm (GENios, TECAN ® ) and the results were calculated using a standard calibration curve.
The values were normalized to protein content and expressed as the mean ±SEM of GSH mmol/mg protein of each experimental group.

Western Blotting
The samples (30 μg proteins) were run on 4-15% SDS polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories S.r.L.) and electroblotted onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibody recognizing phospho-GSK3α/β (Ser21/9), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2, Thr202/Tyr204) (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc), or anti-synaptophysin (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich).
After washing with TBS-T (TBS + 0.05% Tween20), the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:2,000; GE Healthcare).
ECL was used to visualize the bands (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
The membranes were then reprobed with GSK3α/β, p44-42 MAPK (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), or anti-β-actin (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich).
The data were analyzed by densitometry, using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories ® S.r.L.).
The values were normalized and expressed as the mean ± SEM of the densitometry in each experimental group.

Immunohistochemistry
The fixed brains were sliced on a vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Milan, Italy) at 40 μm thickness, and the slices were stained as described earlier

Hematoxylin/Eosin Staining
Hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining was assessed as previously illustrated
Briefly, the selected sections were rehydrated by a graded series of alcohols (Sigma-Aldrich).
Then, the slices were counterstained in hematoxylin for 8 min and then rinsed for 10 min in tap water.
Subsequently, the slices were immersed in distilled water and then in 80% ethanol before being stained in 25% eosin solution (in ethanol 80%) for 1 min.
Finally, the slices were dehydrated with graded alcohol before being fixed in xylen.

Anti-Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) Staining
The immunofluorescence staining was assessed according to our previous study
Selected slices were rinsed in phosphate buffer and then incubated in TBS-A (TBS 0.1% Triton-X 100) and TBS-B (TBS-A 2% BSA) to reduce a specific absorption.
The sections were then incubated with anti-GFAP primary antibody (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) in TBS-B with 3% NGS (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 4°C overnight.
After 24 h, the slices were washed with TBS-A and TBS-B before being incubated with secondary antibody (1:200; Fluorescein, Life Technologies) in TBS-B with 3% NGS.
To verify the binding specificity, some sections were incubated with only primary or secondary antibody.
In these conditions, we did not find any positive staining.

Quantitative Images Analysis
Image analysis was conducted by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups, using a microscope (AxioImager M1, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and an image analysis system (AxioCam MRc5, Carl Zeiss) equipped with dedicated software (AxioVision Rel 4.8, Carl Zeiss).
The hippocampal region was defined at low magnification (2.5× objective), and the H&E or GFAP staining was evaluated by densitometry of five different sections for each sample analyzed at a higher magnification (10×, 20×, or 40× objective).
Quantification and morphological analysis were assessed with the ImageJ software.

RNA Preparation and Gene Expression Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from hippocampus using the Pure link RNA mini kit (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as illustrated earlier
Briefly, the samples were lysed on ice with 1% β-mercaptoethanol by using a homogenizer SHM1 (Stuart, Bibby Scientific LTD, Staffordshire, UK).
The samples were then added to an equal volume of 70% ethanol.
The solution was filtered using a cartridge containing a clear silica-based membrane to which the RNA binds.
RNA was finally eluted with RNase-free water and stored at -80°C.
RNA was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis and reversetranscribed using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The mRNA encoding for the mouse nuclear factor (erythroidderived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), GSH reductase (GR), tumor protein 53 (TP53), and the actin (ACTB) as internal reference were quantified by Taqman RT-PCR with a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
The samples were run in 96-well format in triplicate.
The specific Taqman gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were Nrf2 (Mm0047784_m1), GSTP1 (Mm04213618_ gH), GR (Mm00439154_m1), TP53 (Mm01731290_g1), and ACTB (Mm00607939_s1).
To assess mRNA levels of different BDNF transcripts (total form, long 3′UTR form, exon IV, exon VI) and synaptophysin, samples were processed for RT-PCR reaction and subsequently analyzed by qRT-PCR instrument (CFX384 Real-Time system, Bio-Rad Laboratories S.r.l.) using the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit for probes (Bio-Rad Laboratories S.r.l.).
The samples were run in 384-well format in triplicate as multiplexed reactions with a normalizing internal control (ACTB).
The primers and probe sequences, respectively, were as follows: total BDNF (Fwd: AAGTCTGCATTACATTCCTCGA, Rev: GTTTTCTGAAAGA GGGACAGTTTAT, Probe: TGTGGTTTGTTGCCGTTGCCA AG), long 3′UTR BDNF (Fwd: GTTGTCATTGCTTTACTGGCG, Rev: AATTTTCTCCATCCCTACTCCG, Probe: AATCTACCCC TCCCATTCCCCGT), BDNF exon IV (Fwd: AGCTGCCTTGAT GTTTACTTTG, Rev: CGTTTACTTCTTTCATGGGCG, Probe: AGGATGGTCATCACTCTTCTCACCTGG), BDNF exon VI (Fwd: GGACCAGAAGCGTGACAAC, Rev: ATGCAACCGAAG TATGAAATAACC, Probe: ACCAGGTGAGAAGAGTGATGAC CATCC), Synaptophysin (Fwd: CCTGTCCGATGTGAAGATGG, Rev: AGGTTCAGGAAGCCAAACAC, Probe: ACACATGCAAG GAACTGAGGGACC), and ACTB (Fwd: ACCTTCTACAATGA GCTGCG, Rev: CTGGATGGCTACGTACATGG, Probe: TCTG GGTCATCTTTTCACGGTTGGC).
Each RT-PCR run followed the manufacturer's conditions: an incubation at 50°C for 10 min (RNA retrotranscription), followed by a step at 95°C for 5 min (TaqMan polymerase activation).
Subsequently, 39 cycles of PCR were performed (95°C for 10 s, and then 30 s at 60°C).
A comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method was used to determine the relative target gene expression versus the sham group
Specifically, a fold change for each target gene relative to ACTB was determined by the 2 -Δ(ΔCt) method, where ΔCt = Ct, target -Ct, β-actin; Δ(ΔCt) = Ct, exp. group -Ct, control group and Ct is the threshold cycle.
For graphical clarity, the obtained data were then expressed as percentage versus the Sham/VH, which has been set at 100%.

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed with the PRISM 5 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and expressed as mean ± SEM of each experimental group.
The difference between the groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.
The results were considered statistically significant when a p value was less than 0.05.
showed a significantly lower escape latency than those in the Aβ/VH group (p < 0.05; Figure
The swimming speed was not significantly different among the groups during the training (data not shown).
In the probe trial, the mice in the Aβ/VH group revealed difficulties in locating the original position of the removed platform (longer latency to first enter the target zone, less frequency crossing the platform, and more time spent swimming in the opposite quadrant; Figure
Interestingly, the Aβ/DON and Aβ/PQM130 mice performed better than the Aβ/VH, even though significantly only with regard to time spent in the opposite quadrant (donepezil p < 0.01; PQM130 p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively).
In the Y-maze test, which assesses spatial working memory, the spontaneous alternation behavior of Aβ/VH group was significantly lower than the sham group (p < 0.05, Figure
This behavioral impairment was significantly improved in the Aβ/DON and Aβ/PQM130 groups (donepezil p < 0.001; PQM130 p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), demonstrating that DON and PQM130 could effectively increase spatial working memory in the early stage of AD development.

RESULTS

PQM130

PQM130 Prevented Aβ 1-42 O-Induced Neuronal Death in Mice
We next observed the pathologic changes in different hippocampal areas through H&E-stained sections from the sham, the Aβ/VH group, and the mice under different treatments (DON and PQM130 treatment groups: 1 and 0.5 mg/kg).
In the Aβ/VH mice, H&E staining exhibited irregular and sparse neuronal arrangements in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions of the hippocampus.
We also observed many unhealthy neurons (Figure
Interestingly, PQM130 treatment but not donepezil ameliorated neuronal injury compared with the saline-treated Aβ group (p < 0.01, Figure
In AD, increased p53 level was detected in various parts of patient brains
Likewise, data from animal AD models showed an increase in p53 level in affected neurons
As could be expected, the Aβ treatment induced the up-regulation of p53 at gene level.
On the contrary, PQM130 but not donepezil significantly down-regulated p53 expression (p < 0.05, Figure
Subsequently, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the PQM130 improvement on Aβ-induced neuronal damage, the activations of caspase-9 and -3 were detected.
Once activated, the caspase-9 cleaves and activates the effector procaspase-3 triggering the apoptotic pathway.
As shown in Figure
However, PQM130 treatment was able to inhibit the activation of both caspases induced by Aβ 1-42 O, especially at the highest dose (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), while donepezil was effective to counteract the activation of the caspase-3 but not caspase-9 (p < 0.05).

PQM130 Antagonized Aβ 1-42 O-Induced Oxidative Stress in Mice
As shown in Figure
However, the administration of PQM130, but not donepezil, resulted in the significant decrease of ROS compared with the Aβ/VH group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).
Moreover, PQM130 treatment increased GSH levels in the hippocampi of the Aβ/VH mice close to the sham group levels, particularly with the 0.5 mg/kg dose group (p < 0.01).
In addition, we carried out gene expression profiling as an effective biomarker to detect cellular stress.
In this study, the gene expression analysis for GR enzyme and Nrf2 demonstrated that Aβ treatment decreased GR mRNA expression levels, while donepezil and PQM130 (0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased GR mRNA levels (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively; Figure
As expected, the expression of Nrf2 was found to be significantly decreased in the hippocampi of the Aβ/VH mice (p < 0.001); conversely, PQM130 (1 mg/kg) treatment markedly up-regulated the mRNA levels of Nrf2, compared to the Aβ/VH mice (p < 0.001).

PQM130 Regulated GSK3β and ERK1/2 Protein Expressions in Mice
Because glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) played a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD
As shown in Figure
However, the treatment with PQM130 at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated GSK3β protein (p < 0.05).
In addition, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also detected in our model, since the MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved in the modulation of neuronal apoptosis and may contribute to AD pathogenesis
Results found the Aβ 1-42 O injection increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 compared with the sham group (p < 0.001).
However, treatment with PQM130 and donepezil markedly repressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by Aβ 1-42 O (p < 0.05, Figure

PQM130 Reduced Aβ 1-42 O-Induced Astrocytic Activation in Mice
To examine the effects of PQM130 on neuroinflammation induced by Aβ 1-42 O, we performed immunohistochemical staining for the astrocyte marker GFAP.
The quantitative analysis showed that the percentages of the GFAP-stained hippocampal areas were markedly increased in the Aβ/VH group compared with the Sham/VH group (p < 0.01).
However, in the PQM130treated mice (1 mg/kg), GFAP-positive areas decreased (p < 0.01, Figure
These results suggested that PQM130 treatment alleviated the neuroinflammation induced by Aβ 1-42 O in the AD brain.

PQM130 Modulated Synaptic Plasticity in Mice
Firstly, we analyzed the total BDNF gene expression in our samples and the results did not show any significant difference among the different experimental groups (Figure
In order to clarify the different responsiveness to PQM130, the expression profile of some neurotrophin transcripts, namely, long 3′UTR BDNF and exons IV and VI, were investigated (Figure
In deep, PQM130 (1 mg/kg) increased significantly the expression of long 3′UTR BDNF (p < 0.05, Figure
Classic effects of BDNF consist of promoting differentiation, migration, and dendritic arborization, and enhancing neuronal viability.
In addition to these recognized actions, recent findings highlighted that BDNF affects development, function, and plasticity in the synapse
Thus, we next investigated the effect of PQM130 on the pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin.
As shown in Figure
Even more interesting, the Western blot analysis (Figure
However, after PQM130 treatment (1 mg/kg), the expression of synaptophysin was significantly increased as compared to the Aβ/VH group (p < 0.05).

DISCUSSION
The inhibition of AChE activity is the most realistic approach in the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe AD.
Patients are currently treated with AChE inhibitors, and among these, the first-line symptomatic drug is donepezil.
In the light of the increasingly accepted conception of AD as a complex pathological network, intensive efforts are being made in the search of new drugs that can simultaneously hit several key biological targets of the network, including AChE.
Moreover, AD has decades-long preclinical period
Taking into account all these considerations, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy of the feruloyldonepezil hybrid PQM130 on AD neurodegenerative processes and on cognitive outcomes, trying to make also a comparison with donepezil activity.
In our previous study, PQM130 had already shown an interesting in vivo anti-inflammatory activity and in vitro metal chelator activity, as well as neuroprotective activity against oxidative damage
Here, we have elucidated the multifaceted activities of PQM130, like decreasing neuronal death and oxidative stress, improved neurotrophic effect, counteracted inflammation, and ameliorated spatial memory functions as compared to the Aβ 1-42 O lesioned group.
It is clear that a successful neuroprotective and neurotrophic strategy could not only delay the progression of neurodegeneration but also provide improvements in the disease condition.
In the MWM test, two main parameters are necessary to locate the hidden platform.
Firstly, the mice should develop skills needed to handle the stressful condition, like swimming and recognizing the hidden platform as the only escape route.
The second parameter is the spatial learning component, which implies that the mice have to learn exactly the platform's position and reach it within a minute from the different starting position
Here, we found a progressive improvement in the spatial memory as shown by the significant reduction in escape latency time in the PQM130-treated mice as compared to the Aβ/VH mice when evaluated on the 4th and 5th days.
This improvement may be ascribed to PQM130's ability to reduce oxidative stress and AChE activity to finally enhance cholinergic neuronal transmission.
The Aβ/DON group showed a swimming performance comparable to the mice treated with the same dose of PQM130.
This effect of donepezil may be related to its AChE inhibition
However, the probe trial was not implemented significantly in this study, only the time spent in the opposite quadrant markedly decreased after PQM130 and donepezil treatments.
Thus, the reduced escape latency time in the PQM130-treated group demonstrates its interesting effect on spatial learning ability.
Working memory has been previously reported to be negatively involved in the early stages of AD
The continuous spontaneous   alternation in the Y-maze test can both elude stressful handling of animals and provide memory and locomotor evaluation
Interestingly, we showed that PQM130 counteracted the negative effect of Aβ 1-42 O on working memory in a dose-dependent manner.
This was highlighted by the significant enhancement in percent of alternation behavior in the Y-maze, and the effects of the highest dose of PQM130 are comparable to those of donepezil.
Our data are in agreement with previous studies showing that donepezil significantly improves alternation deficits in this test
Although it is not clearly known how Aβ injection can induce memory impairment in mice, we previously established that Aβ directly caused apoptosis leading to neuronal cell loss and, ultimately, neurodegeneration
The memory and cognitive decline in AD are strongly related to the apoptotic pathway
Our data showed that the hippocampal damage and caspase-9 and -3 activations in lesioned mice were markedly reversed by PQM130.
Meanwhile, donepezil did not show the same effectiveness in counteracting apoptosis and neuronal damage.
Moreover, increased p53 level is infallibly detectable in brain areas attained by AD, in the corresponding brain areas of animal models, and in neuronal cells isolated from AD brains
Interestingly, PQM130 substantially reduced the expression of p53, which corroborated its antiapoptotic activity.
It is known that p53 directly binds to and increases the activity of GSK3β while inhibition of nuclear GSK3β attenuated p53-dependent transcription
The link between p53 and GSK3β (i.e., between p53 and tau phosphorylation) may be more complex; however, in this study, we found that the decrease in p53 expression levels after PQM130 treatment is most likely reflected in a phosphorylation (and thus deactivation) of GSK3β, leading to protection against neuronal death induced by Aβ 1-42 O. Several studies demonstrated that oxidative stress precedes the rise of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, therefore leading to dementia's symptoms
Indeed, the increase of Aβ and oxidative stress, causing neuronal cell death, are common mechanisms in the progression of AD
Here, we found that PQM130 and not donepezil significantly ameliorates oxidative damage as demonstrated by the increase of GSH levels and GR and Nrf2 expressions in the Aβ 1-42 O-treated mice, confirming the similar evidences recorded by PQM130 in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells
The role of Nrf2 in Aβ-induced oxidative stress is controversial
Ramsey and colleagues described that in AD brains, Nrf2 is mostly found in the cytoplasm in its inactive form, which means that Nrf2 does not trigger the expression of antioxidant enzymes
Sarkar and colleagues demonstrated that Aβ 25-35 increased oxidative stress and suppressed Nrf2 activation
Moreover, Branca et al. showed that reducing Nrf2 levels exacerbated cognitive impairments in a transgenic model of AD.
They also speculated that "Nrf2 might act as a molecular link between brain aging and AD"
Numerous laboratories supported this hypothesis showing that Nrf2 activity decreased with aging
Moreover, Nrf2 activity is strictly related to tau pathology, enhancing the link between Nrf2 and AD
In our model, exposure to Aβ 1-42 O caused a marked decrease in Nrf2 activation, and only PQM130 significantly increased its expression, probably due to the presence of ferulic acid in this hybrid molecule.
In this regard, the presence of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl system in PQM130 suggests the ability of this molecule to activate Nrf2 through a Michael addition reaction
Thus, the effect of PQM130 on Aβ 1-42 O-induced oxidative injury could explain the ability of PQM130 to counteract apoptotic cell death and cognitive impairment observed in our model.
Activity of ERK1/2 is modulated by ROS, and several studies demonstrated its activation in different AD models
Moreover, inhibition of ROS formation decreased ERK1/2 activation in an AD model
The ERK pathway is fundamental to memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
Moreover, the fine regulation of ERK is crucial for the hippocampal functions
Notably, in our model, Aβ 1-42 O contributed to the abnormal activation of ERK1/2 and there was an obvious decrease of p-ERK1/2 levels by PQM130 administration.
ERK activation is also found in reactive astrocytes, affecting Aβ production through ROS formation
Therefore, compounds inactivating astrocytes and MAPK pathways could reduce Aβ formation and thus prevent or counteract neuronal injury in the AD brain
Additionally, glial cells and their resident protein GFAP are able to combine neuronal input, control synaptic activity, and translate signals tightly linked to learning and memory by the formation of cytoskeletal filaments
Our results showed that PQM130 and not donepezil might alleviate reactive gliosis, by reason of the ability of this treatment to reduce levels of GFAP in the hippocampus of the Aβ 1-42 O-lesioned mice.
BDNF belongs to the neurotrophin family of survivalpromoting molecules.
It exerts significant protective effects on fundamental neuronal pathways altered in AD
The transcription of the BDNF gene is very elaborated.
At least eight promoters encode to different mRNA transcripts, each containing a 5′ exon spliced to a common 3′ coding exon, and all of which generate the same BDNF protein
We examined the expression of total BDNF mRNA, two 5′ exon-specific transcripts (IV and VI), and BDNF mRNA transcripts with a long 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in the hippocampal samples.
BDNF mRNA transcripts with long 3′UTRs play essential roles in dendritic spine morphology and long-lasting synaptic plasticity
In our model, the expression of these transcripts was not reduced by Aβ 1-42 O injection; however, PQM130 markedly increased long 3′UTR and exon IV.
Intriguingly, the increased level of BDNF in the hippocampus was accompanied by an up-regulated expression of synaptophysin.
Therefore, these neurochemical results lead us to assume that PQM130 may activate the BDNF signaling pathway and thus control the expression of its downstream signaling components and the structural proteins associated to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, improving cognitive deficits in mice.
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated the nootropic, neuroprotective, and neurotrophic activities of the multi-target drug PQM130 in our AD experimental model.
The nootropic effect could be related to the inhibition of AChE activity and the modulation of neuronal survival pathways, and consequently ameliorating the spatial memory formation.
Neuroprotection might be attributed to its high potential as antioxidant, and to its ability to counteract apoptotic death and inflammation.
Neurotrophicity might be ascribed to its increased BDNF and synaptophysin levels in the hippocampus.
Compared to the first-line treatment donepezil, PQM130 appears a more attractive multipotent therapeutic molecule.
Thus, our research findings prospect PQM130 as a promising candidate to be further investigated in AD therapy.
