Systematically Characterize the Anti-Alzheimer’s Disease Mechanism of Lignans from S. chinensis Based on In-Vivo Ingredient Analysis and Target-Network Pharmacology Strategy by UHPLC–Q-TOF-MS
Lignans from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.)
Baill can ameliorate cognitive impairment in animals with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the metabolism of absorbed ingredients and the potential targets of the lignans from S. chinensis in animals with AD have not been systematically investigated.
Therefore, for the first time, we performed an in-vivo ingredient analysis and implemented a target-network pharmacology strategy to assess the effects of lignans from S. chinensis in rats with AD.
Ten absorbed prototype constituents and 39 metabolites were identified or tentatively characterized in the plasma of dosed rats with AD using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
Based on the results of analysis of the effective constituents in vivo, the potential therapeutic mechanism of the effective constituents in the rats with AD was investigated using a target-network pharmacology approach and independent experimental validation.
The results showed that the treatment effects of lignans from S. chinensis on cognitive impairment might involve the regulation of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, neurofibrillary tangles, neurotransmitter metabolism, inflammatory response, and antioxidant system.
Overall, we identified the effective components of lignans in S. chinensis that can improve the cognitive impairment induced by AD and proposed potential therapeutic metabolic pathways.
The results might serve as the basis for a fundamental strategy to explore effective therapeutic drugs to treat AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become one of the leading diseases affecting the health of the elderly population, with a prevalence of 5% after 65 years of age, which increases to approximately 30% in people aged 85 years or older
It is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, including impaired judgment, decision-making, and orientation; the disease is often accompanied by psycho-behavioral disturbances and language impairment in the later stages
The pathogenesis of AD is still unclear.
A widely accepted hypothesis is the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which suggests that amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition might trigger neuronal dysfunction and death in the brain, resulting in AD
Alzheimer's disease has imposed a heavy burden on the healthcare and socio-economic development of elderly population.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists are the first line drugs for treating AD.
The therapeutic effects of AChEIs are attributable to the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the brain
The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist might protect neurons from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and it has been reported to be beneficial in the advanced stages of AD
These two kinds of drugs can slow the emergence of the behavioral and psychotic symptoms associated with AD.
However, there is still no convincing evidence to suggest that these drugs can halt or reverse the progression of AD.
Therefore, it is important to study the drugs that can effectively ameliorate the progression of AD.
For thousands of years, medicines have been closely linked to natural products, which are still a significant source of new drugs
Wuweizi, in Chinese, is the dry fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.)
Baill.
(Magnoliaceae); it mainly contains lignans, sugars, tannins, essential oils, and organic acids
The lignans isolated from S. chinensis have been associated with antihepatotoxic, antioxidant, detoxification, and neuroprotective effects, and these effects have potential roles in the treatment of AD
Lignan extracts from S. chinensis can ameliorate cognitive impairment, and they have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in animals with AD
In our laboratory, we also proved that the extract of S. chinensis can significantly shorten the escape latency time and increase the crossing time of target and central zones (%) in rats with diabetic encephalopathy
Studies analyzing the in vivo metabolism of lignans from S. chinensis have mainly been conducted in normal rats
An organism is a complexly networked biological system.
Several diseases (such as diabetes, depression, and cancer) are caused by altered expression of multiple genes or proteins.
Therefore, drugs designed for a single target are unlikely to effectively treat these complex diseases.
Network pharmacology is a novel method that combines system network analysis and pharmacology.
Based on existing biological data, networks of target-disease, compound-compound, and compound-target interactions can be built to identify potential drug targets and clarify the action mechanism of a drug
In recent years, target-network pharmacology (T-NP) has been introduced, which focuses on the relationship between the absorbable bioactive constituents and network pharmacology
Compared with the conventional network pharmacology method, T-NP can reduce the false positive rate
In this study, we aimed to: (1) isolate and identify lignans from S. chinensis using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) in the plasma of dosed rats with AD; (2) clarify the mechanism of action of lignans from S. chinensis in treating AD (T-NP was used to integrate the absorbed constituents with the corresponding target proteins to generate a compound-target network); and (3) verify the related pathways and targets.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the possible metabolic pathways of lignans from S. chinensis in rats with AD and clarify the network pharmacology of their action mechanism in the treatment of AD.

Results

Identification of Absorbed Effective Constituents and their Metabolites from Lignans in S. chinensis
Pharmacokinetic studies on the main lignans from S. chinensis have proved that the peak time after oral administration ranges from 15 to 360 min
The concentration-time curve of schisandrin, schisandrol B, and deoxyschizandrin from S. chinensis extract has showed the second peak at 480 min
Based on these findings, we chose 30, 60, 120, 360, and 480 min as the time points to analyze the effective constituents absorbed in the blood.
Using a blank plasma sample as the reference, we identified the characteristic ion peaks that only appeared in the plasma of dosed rats.
The absorbed prototype constituents were then identified by comparing the peaks with the fragmentation information of the lignans, and some were also compared with those of the reference standards.
The constituents identified are presented in Table
The following 10 lignans were found in the plasma of dosed rats as prototype constituents: schisandrin, gomisin D, benzoylgomisin H, angeloylgomisin Q, schisandrol B, gomisin G, gomisin K, gomisin E, deoxyschizandrin, and schisandrin B (Table
The prototype constituents absorbed into blood can be further metabolized by various drug-metabolizing enzymes in vivo.
Drug metabolism is divided into two phase reactions, namely, phases I and II.
In phase I reaction, the absorbed prototype constituents are usually oxidized or reduced.
In phase II reaction, the constituents are mainly involved in binding reactions, and they conjugate to copolymers with small endogenous molecules, such as glucuronic acid, amino acids, and phosphate from phosphorylation
A comparison of the characteristic ion peaks between the blank and dosed plasma samples revealed that there were some chromatographic ion peaks in only the plasma of dosed rats, in addition to the chromatographic ion peaks identified as prototype constituents.
We speculated that these peaks were the metabolites of the prototype constituents.
According to the principles of drug metabolism and related references
The collision energy was then adjusted to obtain fragment ions of the metabolites for the MS/MS analysis.
For example, M9, M28, and M33-35 were identified as metabolites generated from deoxyschizandrin (Figure
M9 showed [M -H] -ion at m/z 433.2210, which was 16 Da higher than that of the quasi-molecular ion of deoxyschizandrin.
The mass change was similar to that of mono-oxidized deoxyschizandrin.
M9 showed fragment ions at m/z 415,
M9 presented the same fragment ions with schisandrin.
According to the MS/MS analysis results, M9 was identified as schisandrin.
Studies have proved that deoxyschizandrin can be metabolized to schisandrin in rat
M33 showed [M + H] + ions at m/z 403.2093, which was 14 Da less than that of the prototype.
The mass change corresponded to the loss of CH 2 from deoxyschizandrin.
M33 showed fragment ions at m/z 388, 385, 372, 370, 371, and 339.
The characteristic fragment ions of M33 were consistent with those of schisanhenol
M28 showed [M + H] + ions at m/z 419.2061, which was 16 Da higher than that of M33.
M28 showed fragment ions at m/z 401, 370, 369, and 337.
The MS behavior of M28 was similar to that of M33.
Therefore, demethylation and hydroxylation occurred at 1-and 7-or 8-positions, respectively.
M34 showed [M + H] + ions at m/z 449.2154, which was 16 Da higher than that of schisandrin.
M34 showed fragment ions at m/z 431, 413, 398, and 383 by the successive loss of H 2 O, H 2 O, CH 3 , and CH 3 , respectively.
The characteristic fragment ions of M34 were similar to those of schisandrin and deoxyschizandrin.
Therefore, the hydroxylation occurred at 6-, 8-, and 9-positions, respectively.
M35 showed [M + H] + ions at m/z 413.1944, which was 36 Da higher than that of M34.
M35 showed fragment ions at 398 and 383, which were consistent with the fragment ions 413 of M34.
Therefore, desaturation mostly occurred at 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-positions.
Based on the above identification method, all possible metabolites of the prototype constituents absorbed into blood were identified.
The MS and MS/MS data of the identified metabolites are summarized in Table
The main metabolic pathways of the lignans from S. chinensis included hydroxylation, demethylation, reduction, phosphorylation, and dehydration.
The proposed metabolic pathways of the absorbed constituents are showed in Figures

Target Genes Related to the Identified Compounds
To further illuminate the relationship between the absorbed effective constituents and disease pathways, an absorbed effective constituent-target-disease network was built.
Using public databases (viz., TCMSP, TCMID, TTD, Binding DB, OMIM, NCBI GENE), we identified approximately 2300 targets associated with AD and 38 targets in the absorbed effective constituents of lignans.
Of all the targets, 17 target genes were shared by AD and absorbed effective constituents (Table
Those genes were utilized for further pathway analysis.
The DAVID and KEGG databases were applied to enrich significantly correlated pathways (P < 0.05) that the targets were involved in.
Meanwhile, the databases provided extended targets associated with these pathways.
To obtain more potential therapeutic targets of lignans, a comparison was made between extended and AD-related targets.
Hence, we obtained 27 targets that were closely related to lignans (Table
Finally, we input all the targets and constituents into Cytoscape and established the networks of effective constituents-targets-diseases (Figure

Target Validation
According to the above potential target analysis, we found that the lignans from S. chinensis were associated with amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neurotransmitter metabolism, nitric oxide (NO) anabolism, inflammatory response, retinol metabolism, lipid metabolism, glutathione (GSH) metabolism, oxidative stress, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis.
To clarify the mechanism of action of S. chinensis lignans in the treatment of AD, independent experimental validation based on the T-NP analysis results was performed.

Cyclins are regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).
Recently, studies have indicated that the deregulation of the neuronal cell cycle plays an important role in several central nervous system diseases
The interaction between the above targets and S. chinensis lignans' active constituents, including gomisin K, angeloylgomisin Q, benzoylgomisin H, schisandrol B, gomisin D, gomisin G, and schisandrin B, suggests that the lignans from S. chinensis might regulate neuronal cell-cycle progression and apoptosis in rats with AD.
Additionally, according to the results of the T-NP analysis, it was found that NFTs, Aβ deposition, or neuronal loss were also closely related to other targets affected by lignans, such as AChE and HMOX1.
This observation indicates that NFTs, Aβ deposition, or neuronal loss might play an important role in the therapeutic effect of lignans from S. chinensis in AD treatment.
The βand γ-secretases take part in releasing Aβ, which has neurotoxic effect
β-Secretase is a rate-limiting enzyme in APP degradation and γ-secretase is a rate-limiting enzyme in Aβ production
The lignans from S. chinensis can alleviate Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuronal dysfunction and death in the brain of rat with AD. γ-Secretase and GSK-3β were considered potential targets of S. chinensis lignans for regulating Aβ deposition and hyperphosphorylated forms of tau.
These results indicate that lignans from S. chinensis could affect the activity of GSK-3β in rats with AD, thus verifying the correctness and reliability of the T-NP analysis.
By verifying the relevant targets, we found that Aβ, γ-secretase, tau, and neuronal dysfunction and death are effective therapeutic targets of the lignans from S. chinensis for treating AD.

Effects of Lignans from S. chinensis on Inflammatory and Oxidant Damage in Rats with AD
Inflammation and oxidative oxidation might stimulate the production of Aβ, resulting in the aggravation of AD.
Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), along with iNOS and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), synthesizes NO from L-arginine and molecular oxygen
Nitric oxide is a reactive free radical and shares several properties with a neurotransmitter in the nervous system.
It has multiple cellular molecular targets, including N-methyl-D-aspartate, Glu, ACh, DA, NE, GABA, taurine, and Gly
Furthermore, NO is involved in inflammation and enhances the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)
Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) is a key enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis and is divided into a constitutive PTGS1 and an inducible PTGS2; it catalyzes the conversion of AA to PG
PTGS2 is responsible for the production of inflammatory PGs.
Both iNOS and PTGS2 are major inflammatory mediators
Arachidonic acid is an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid in organisms that can mediate inflammation
In organisms, LA can be converted to AA.
The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases that catalyze various reactions, including metabolism of drugs and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids
Thromboxane A synthase 1 (TBXAS1) is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes.
However, TBXAS1 is considered a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily based on the sequence similarity rather than functional similarity
TBXAS1 is associated with bleeding disorders.
The cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4) is an important paralog of TBXAS1.
In organisms, CYP3A4 participates in the conversion of LA to epoxyoctadecenoic acid, which is the peroxidation product of LA.
It has been reported that treatment with schisandrin B and schisandrin A for three days can inhibit the activity of CYP3A4 and increase the concentration and oral bioavailability of drug metabolized by CYP3A
Li et al. investigated the inhibitory effects of schisandrin A and schisandrin B on CYP3A activity in rat liver microsomes and found that schisandrin-induced inhibition is mostly attributable to a mixed noncompetitive and complete inhibition
Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFB1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK 1), and MAPK3 belong to the MAPK signaling pathway.
These three targets are associated with cellular responses to proinflammatory cytokines
Both the TNF and MAPK signaling pathways are closely related to the damage induced by cytotoxic drugs, irradiation, heat shock, reactive oxygen species, and lipopolysaccharide.
Studies have shown that schisandrol B can suppress the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in microglia cells
Additionally, MAPKs can regulate cell survival and apoptosis
The MAPK signaling pathway affects the glutamatergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic synapse pathways.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a member of the MAPK family.
Studies have found that ERK is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory in the brain
Gomisin K, benzoylgomisin H, schisandrol B, schisandrin B, and gomisin D were found to interact with iNOS, PTGS1, PTGS2, TGFB1, and MAPK, indicating that these compounds exerted anti-inflammatory effects.
In the present study, we speculated that the anti-inflammatory effects might be one of the ways by which the lignans from S. chinensis improve learning and memory in rats with AD.
The results of target validation showed that the lignans in S. chinensis alleviated inflammation in rats with AD by directly regulating the level of TNF-α, PGE2, NO, and NOS, and these results are consistent with those of the T-NP analysis.
The lignans from S. chinensis alleviated the abnormal metabolism of AA and LA.
The inhibitory effects of lignans from S. chinensis on the activity of CYP3A4 might inhibit the peroxidation of LA, thus increasing the level of LA in rats with AD.
Lignans from S. chinensis might promote the metabolism of AA to PGs and inhibit the metabolism of LA to AA, thus increasing the anti-inflammatory ability in organisms.
Tumor necrosis factor-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and PGE2 is a member of PG with immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects.
The results of the present study showed that the lignans from S. chinensis alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress in rats with AD by directly regulating the level of TNF-α, PGE2, SOD, and CAT.
In addition to NOS, other targets such as GSH and HMOX were found to be associated with the antioxidant activity of lignans from S. chinensis.
Glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) is a central enzyme of cellular antioxidant defense, and it reduces oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form, GSH, which is an important cellular antioxidant
The liver is considered the central organ of GSH metabolism, and the concentration of GSH in plasma and erythrocytes could reflect the ability of the liver to synthesize GSH.
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2) is important for the coordinated up-regulation of genes in response to oxidative stress.
It negatively regulates the oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway
The HMOX1 gene encodes the HMOX protein, which has antioxidative, neuroprotective, and potentially anti-inflammatory effects
The binding of APP inhibits the HMOX activity, and the absence of HMOX activity might contribute to neuronal cell death in patients with AD
The active constituents of lignans from S. chinensis, including schisandrin B, schisandrin, and deoxyschizandrin, might regulate the above targets, indicating that the lignans might have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
Studies have shown that schisandrin B acts as an antioxidant to prevent cerebral oxidative stress and tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced cerebral toxicity in mice
Malondialdehyde is a product of lipid peroxidation.
The level of MDA in the plasma indirectly reflects the severity of free radical attack on body cells.
Glutathione, CAT, HMOX1, and SOD are all important antioxidants in organisms, and they have several important physiological functions, such as scavenging free radicals, and maintaining normal cell growth and cellular immunity
Therefore, the levels of these compounds constitute an important standard by which the antioxidant ability of an organism can be evaluated.
In the present study, the lignans from S. chinensis alleviated oxidative stress in rats with AD by directly upregulating the level of SOD and CAT.

Effects of Lignans from S. chinensis on Neurotransmitters in Rats with AD
As an important part of the nervous system, neurotransmitters play the role of chemical messengers in the transmission of nerve signals.
They are closely related to the learning and memory of an organism.
In recent years, the close relationship between neurotransmitters and AD pathogenesis has attracted attention
Cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus are crucially involved in learning and memory, and their dysfunction can lead to a severe form of dementia
Acetylcholine is a key neurotransmitter of the cholinergic system.
As a molecular chaperone, AChE is involved in Aβ aggregation and deposition in the pathogenesis of AD.
Both the peripheral anionic site and the N-terminal region of AChE have been indicated as Aβ binding domains
Acetylcholine esterase aggregates in the nucleus of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells can promote the process of neuroblastoma cell apoptosis
Programmed cell death plays an integral role in AD.
The active constituents of lignans from S. chinensis, including gomisin K, might affect Aβ accumulation and neuronal apoptosis by acting on AChE.
Lignans from S. chinensis could decrease the level of AChE to alleviate the lack of ACh, affecting Aβ deposition and neuronal apoptosis.
5-Hydroxytryptamine belongs to the serotonergic systems, which participate in the regulation of various physiological functions, such as emotions, sleep, appetite, learning, and memory.
The reduction in 5-HT level in the brain impairs the memory of patients with AD
In the present study, we found that the lignans from S. chinensis could increase the level of 5-HT in rats with AD, indicating that these lignans might regulate the dysfunction of serotonergic systems in rats with AD.
Amino acid neurotransmitters contain Asp, Glu, Gly, and GABA.
Gly and GABA exert postsynaptic inhibition and neuroprotective effects
Taurine has neuroprotective effects in organisms, whereas Asp has neurotoxic effects
The active constituents of lignans from S. chinensis exert their neuroprotective effects by decreasing the level of Asp and increasing the level of taurine, Gly, and GABA.
These results indicate that the lignans from S. chinensis alleviate the dysfunctions in amino acid neurotransmitter, GABAergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic systems in rats with AD.
Combining these findings with the results on the antioxidants and neurotransmitters, we found that the lignans from S. chinensis mainly upregulated the level of enzymes that are protective against oxidative stress and neuroprotective amino acid neurotransmitters.
We speculated that the lignans from S. chinensis have a significant role in the protection of the central nervous system during the pathological process of AD, and this might be the main reason for its ability to treat AD.

Effects of Lignans from S. chinensis on other Pathways in Rats with AD
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) is a regulator of adipocyte differentiation
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and these heterodimers regulate the transcription of various genes
Additionally, PPARG has been implicated in obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.
Some evidence demonstrates that chronic over-nutrition induces metabolic stress and neuroinflammation in the brain.
Nutraceuticals might represent the future of preventing and tackling neurodegenerative disorders.
The active constituent of lignans from S. chinensis-gomisin K-interacts with PPARG, indicating that these compounds might participate in nutrient metabolism.
However, the results of target validation showed that the lignans from S. chinensis did not significantly regulate cholesterol sulfate and 9-CRA.

Conclusions
In this study, the absorbed constituents and metabolites of lignans isolated from S. chinensis in the plasma of rats with AD were separated and identified by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS.
Eleven absorbed prototype constituents and 39 metabolites were identified or tentatively characterized in the plasma of dosed rats.
The major metabolic reactions of the absorbed prototype constituents were determined to be hydroxylation, demethylation, reduction, phosphorylation, and dehydration.
Based on the absorbed prototype constituents in the blood, a new T-NP approach was used to investigate the pharmacodynamic material basis and the pharmacologic mechanism of lignans in S. chinensis for the treatment of AD.
Seventeen target genes involved in AD were found to be associated with multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients of lignans from S. chinensis, including AChE, iNOS, GSK3β, and HMOX1.
These target genes were also associated with other targets including APP, neurotransmitters, and inflammatory response molecules, all of which are involved in AD.
To further reveal the pharmacologic mechanism of lignans from S. chinensis in alleviating the damage to memory and cognitive function in rats with AD, independent experimental validation based on T-NP was performed.
It was found that the lignans from S. chinensis regulated several pathways in rats with AD, including APP metabolism, NFTs, neurotransmitter metabolism, inflammatory response, and the antioxidant system.
Overall, the results provide valuable information and support for further studies on the pharmacology and in vivo action mechanism of lignans from S. chinensis.
The combination of T-NP and independent experimental validation could be used as a simple, quick, and feasible approach to decipher the chemical and pharmacological bases of other natural products.
This study could help researchers elucidate the underlying multi-compound, multi-target, and multi-pathway modes of actions of herbal medicines.
It also offers a novel research strategy for studying the action mechanisms of other herbal medicines.
