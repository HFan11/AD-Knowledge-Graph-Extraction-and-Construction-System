The Role of Structural Polymorphism in Driving the Mechanical Performance of the Alzheimer's Beta Amyloid Fibrils
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is related with the abnormal aggregation of amyloid β-peptides Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 , the latter having a polymorphic character which gives rise to U-or S-shaped fibrils.
Elucidating the role played by the nanoscale-material architecture on the amyloid fibril stability is a crucial breakthrough to better understand the pathological nature of amyloid structures and to support the rational design of bio-inspired materials.
The computational study here presented highlights the superior mechanical behavior of the S-architecture, characterized by a Young's modulus markedly higher than the U-shaped architecture.
The S-architecture showed a higher mechanical resistance to the enforced deformation along the fibril axis, consequence of a better interchain hydrogen bonds' distribution.
In conclusion, this study, focusing the attention on the pivotal multiscale relationship between molecular phenomena and material properties, suggests the S-shaped Aβ 1-42 species as a target of election in computational screen/design/optimization of effective aggregation modulators.

INTRODUCTION
A number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related with the abnormal aggregation of polypeptide chains
Among several theories proposed to explain the cause of AD, the amyloid hypothesis represents one of the most likely scenarios
More in detail, the amyloid hypothesis relates mutations on amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) to the aggregation of Aβ peptides, whose deposition into senile plaques is followed by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal cell death
However, if the formation of these fibrils is the cause or a secondary effect of the disease is not clarified yet
With the existence of several species of Aβ peptides, it was also observed, that the most common peptides in the amyloid plaques are the Aβ 1-40 and the Aβ 1-42 , the latter being the most toxic
For this main reason, previous experimental studies explored the existence of relationships between the molecular structure of amyloid fibrils and disease onset and severity, and on the brittleness of fibrils assemblies
Earlier models of Aβ 1-42 fibrils, showed a Ushaped motif characterized by two β-strands V18-S26 and I31-A42 and stabilized by the intra-chain salt bridge between residues D23-K28
Nevertheless, recent experimental studies suggested another possible architecture for Aβ 1-42 , based on a S-shaped arrangement
The S-architecture is characterized by a central β-strand with residues V24-G33 connecting C-terminal and N-terminal β-strand.
Interestingly, among AD amyloid species, the Aβ 1-42 is the only one able to take also a S-shape form and it is also the most toxic one
The above-mentioned evidences let suppose the fibril architecture playing a role in Aβ 1-42 fibril proliferation and toxicity.
In this context, the mechanical tests of amyloid fibrils are of high importance, considering the well-known interplay between mechanical performance of the fibril architecture and amyloid proliferation
Measurements of the stiffness of these β-sheet-rich protein aggregates have provided conflicting results ranging from soft [10 8 Pa
Several hypotheses have been proposed in literature to unveil the connection between fibrils stiffness and amyloid pathological proliferation.
The mechanical failure of amyloid fibrils was proposed as one of the key factors behind the amyloid proliferation, given the correlation between the fracture properties of amyloid fibrils and the propagation of amyloid diseases
Other investigations have highlighted the exceptional rigidity of the amyloid material as a key factor to distort cell membranes and disrupt their function
In the past, experiments such as atomic force microscopy (AFM)
However, nanoindentation or force spectroscopy experiments do not allow to distinguish among U-or S-shaped architecture, structural transitions in polypeptide chains, and interactions governing the mechanical strength of amyloid structures
Hence the limited resolution of experiments does not allow to clarify the structural composition of the tested amyloids.
In this scenario, molecular modeling
In particular, SMD allows to precisely control the manner in which the force is virtually applied to the system and to clarify the nature of the relationships linking mechanical properties of the system to interatomic interactions
Recently, SMD simulations have been employed to evaluate the force needed to pull away a single peptide from U-shaped Aβ fibrils
In silico approaches have also been applied to estimate the Young's modulus of amyloid fibrils
From the body of available literature, it emerges the need to clearly identify those factors governing fibril material features at molecular level
The present study employs steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations to provide a detailed mechanical characterization of U-and S-shaped Aβ 17-42 small fibrils.
The computational workflow here employed was already successfully applied for similar system in recent literature

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two different experimental models of a Aβ 1-42 species were considered in this work: the U-shaped Aβ 17-42 [PDB ID: 2BEG
A pentamer of Aβ 17-42 was extracted from each of the above mentioned experimentally resolved PDB structures (Supporting Information S1).
For each molecular structure, we will refer to S-shaped model and Ushaped model in the following.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Each molecular system was solvated in a 7 nm side dimension cubic box and neutralized by counterions.
AMBER99-ILDN force-field
It is worth mentioning that the AMBER99-ILDN force-field has already been indicated as meaningful to investigate conformational properties of Aβ amyloid systems
Each system consisted of about 35,000 interacting particles.
The models were firstly minimized by applying the steepest descent energy minimization algorithm.
Then, in order to increase the statistics of MD data, five independent replicas of each molecular system, differing in initial atom velocities, were obtained from the minimized system.
In detail, for each replica a random velocity taken from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 300 K was assigned to every atom of the system during a preliminary position restrained MD simulation (100 ps time duration) in NVT ensemble.
V-rescale thermostat was applied to keep temperature at 300 K with a time constant of 0.1 ps
Then, a second position restrained MD (100 ps time duration) in NPT ensemble was carried out for each system at 300 K (τ = 1 ps) and 1 atm (τ = 5 ps).
V-rescale
Then, an unrestrained MD simulation (100 ns time duration) was run for each replica of both S-and Ufibril models.
During each production run, the V-rescale
The LINCS algorithm
Periodic boundary conditions were applied to all (3) dimensions.
The short range Van der Waals (VDW) interactions were cut-off after 1 nm, and long range electrostatic forces were calculated with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method
GROMACS 5.1.2
package was used for all MD simulations and data analysis
The overall structural stability of each model was determined through the calculation of the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the C-alpha atoms with respect to the initial configuration of the minimized structure (Supporting Information S2).

Steered Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To compare the mechanical response of S-shaped and U-shaped fibrils, several SMD simulations were performed, differing for the prescribed initial condition represented by a MD output configuration (5 MD replicas for U-and S-shaped models), following the procedure described below (Figure
The fibril axis was aligned with the Z-axis in the 3D cartesian space (represented in Figures
A defined set of atoms was pulled toward a certain direction while a second group of atoms was position-restrained, as recently done in literature to study the stability of small amyloid fibrils
In a greater detail, the C-alpha atoms of the chain B were pulled away from the position-restrained reference group (chain D and chain E).
A harmonic force corresponding to the spring constant of 3,000 kJ/(mol nm 2 ) was used to pull the chain B away with a velocity of 0.01 Å/ps.
Other two pulling velocities (0.1 Å/ps and 0.001 Å/ps) were considered to carefully check the dependence of mechanical response on the choice of pulling velocity (Supporting Information S3).
The V-rescale
SMD simulations were performed using GROMACS 5
In summary, 90 SMD simulations have been carried out, i.e., two models (S-and U-fibrils), per five replicas (configurations taken from production dynamics), three pulling directions (X, Y, and Z as shown in Figure

RESULTS

Steered Molecular Dynamics of the Aβ 17-42 Architectures
SMD simulations were carried out on the U-shaped model [Aβ 17-42 pentamer extracted from 2BEG.pdb file
All the presented data have been calculated as average ± standard deviation over the 5 SMD replicas for each simulated architecture considering the pulling velocity of 0.01 Å/ps.
Other two pulling velocities (0.1 Å/ps and 0.001 Å/ps) were considered to carefully check the dependence  of mechanical response on the choice of pulling velocity (Supporting Information S3).
More detailed information on simulation set up and analysis are provided in the Method section.
Explanatory snapshots taken from representative SMD trajectories, together with the simulated force-time profiles, are presented in Figure
The mechanical resistance of U-and S-shape small fibrils were evaluated in terms of the produced peaks shear (X and Y direction) and stretch (Z direction) force values, averaged over the five replicas (Figure
A significant difference was observed between stretch force peaks in the two configurations (F stretchU = 1.795 ± 186 pN vs. F stretchS = 2,073 ± 204 pN).
On the contrary, data from the other two deformation protocols (X and Y pulling direction), indicated similar shear force peak values for Uand S-architectures (Figure
It is worth mentioning that the magnitude of forces estimated by SMD is dependent on the imposed pulling velocity (Supporting Information S3), as highlighted by the most current research
However, the observed difference in the mechanical response to stretching of the two-different fibril U-and S-shaped configurations is also conserved lowering the pulling velocity (Supporting Information S3).
Peak forces are in the same order of magnitude of forces calculated in recent literature for similar structures
Analysis of SMD simulations highlighted that the structural anisotropy of amyloid fibrils is likely to manifest in a correspondent anisotropy of their mechanical properties as indicated by quantified stiffness (Figure
Interestingly, a marked difference between U and S-architectures was observed in the value of the stretching stiffness k (k S ≈ 3k U ), as shown in Figure
The observed shear stiffness (Figure

Mechanical Performance of Aβ 17-42 Architectures
To provide further insight into the mechanical performance of U-and S-shaped models, the stress-strain curves were computed from SMD force-displacement results along the pulling directions (i.e., X-, Y-, and Z-axis).
Technically, each stress value was obtained by dividing the force with the interaction surface between the pulled chain B and the chain C. The application of a linear fitting to the stressstrain data (Figures
In detail, the estimated Young's modulus was E U = 1.4 ± 0.3 GPa and E S = 2.7 ± 0.3 GPa, for U-and S-architecture, respectively.
Moreover, the computed Shear Moduli were G xyU = 0.8 ± 0.3 GPa, G xyS = 1.1 ± 0.3 GPa, G yxU = 0.9 ± 0.1 GPa, G yxS = 0.9 ± 0.2 GPa.
An average value of the shear modulus G along the xy plane (perpendicular to the fibril axis) can be obtained as G = (1/G xy +1/G yx ) -1 and results in a value of about 1 GPa for both U and S-architecture.
Noteworthy, the SMD-based estimates of the Young's moduli are in excellent agreement with recent AFM-based experimental data on Aβ 1-42 species [3.2 ± 0.8 GPa
It's also important to highlight that 2-and 3-fold symmetry Aβ 1-40 fibrils exhibited, as expected, a higher Young Modulus due to a different conformational arrangement and fibril geometry
It is worth mentioning that no marked variations (in both absolute and comparative values) of the quantified moduli were observed by lowering the SMD pulling rate (Supporting Information S3).
The close agreement with experimental data

Interatomic Interactions Drive the Mechanical Response Along the Fibril Axis
There is ample evidence that the mechanical response of amyloid fibrils is driven by the collective rupture behavior of hydrogen bonds sustaining the cross-β structure of Aβ
In particular, the Aβ fibrils are stabilized by a network of backbone hydrogen bonds that acts as a chemical glue allowing them to withstand mechanical forces
Here, to provide a deeper understanding of how the interatomic interactions rule the overall mechanical properties of U-and S-shaped fibrils, the hydrogen bonds between the pulled chain B and the chain C were studied in detail.
In Figure
The U-and Sshaped configurations during the simulated pulling reacted differently to the applied force (Figure
In particular, the S-shaped configuration exhibited a higher tendency than the U-shaped configuration to retain H-bonds as function of the interchain displacement.
The most relevant differences in inter-chain H-bonds between U-and S-shaped configurations are found along fibrils axis (Figure
Given that the two fibril configurations share the same sequence, these findings clearly suggest that the different architecture is responsible for eliciting a different chain detachment pathway.
In case of U arrangement, the first rupture stage was associated with the disruption of the central Hbonds located at Ala30-Ile31 region.
Instead, the S-architecture presented a completely different response, with the N-terminal residues initially (displacement value lower than 1 nm) detached due to the disruption of β 1 (Ala21-Asp23).
For a more clear interpretations of the data, it is worth considering that the perresidue H-bonds depicted in Figure

DISCUSSION
Amyloid protein fibrils are a broad class of misfolded protein structures whose mechanical properties are driven by the noncovalent interactions among (primarily) β-sheets, causing the monomers to stack into fibrils
In particular, amyloid beta (Aβ) assemblies, a subclass of amyloid fibrils, share a cross-β motif in which individual β-strands are oriented perpendicular to the fibril axis, resulting in the formation of a dense hydrogen bonded network which extends along the entire length of the fibril
In the last decade, the intriguing mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils have been the subject of a number of experimental and computational studies
For example, amyloids have been investigated as possible application in the field of functionalized nanowires, novel edible and biodegradable protein-based polymers
Fine tuning of the molecular interactions leading to target mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils represents a pivotal point for further applications of amyloid-based nanostructures as novel biomaterials.
Moreover, understanding the physicochemical properties responsible for to the amyloid mechanical stability may yield an important piece of knowledge into the mechanisms of cellular toxicity.
It is now well established that amyloid fibrils are generally polymorphic at the molecular level
This is also the case of the AD, where the Aβ 1-42 fibril may assume both a U-shaped and S-shaped motif
Elucidating the connection between the molecular features of a specific fibril architecture and its mechanical performance is therefore crucial to rationally design therapeutic strategies aimed at destabilizing amyloid assemblies.
The different mechanical response of U-and S-shaped architectures was tested here by an extensive computational investigation based on SMD simulations.
The resistance of the fibril models to mechanical deformation along specific directions was first analyzed by calculating the magnitude of the mean peak force (Figure
Interestingly the S-shaped arrangement has highlighted better mechanical performances with respect to the U-shaped fibril arrangement.
This is an interesting finding, considering that stretching along the fibril axis directly probes the strength of inter-β-sheet hydrogenbonds.
To complete the picture, it was observed that in both U-shaped and S-shaped configuration the interchain hydrogen-bonding network provided a cooperative resistance.
As detected by peak force analysis, the S-shaped configuration performed better than the U-shaped one, in terms of stiffness constant along the fibril axis (Figure
Notably, these results are in excellent agreement with recent AFM experimental data on Aβ 1-42 species [3.2 ± 0.8 GPa
As expected, the 2-and 3-fold symmetry Aβ 1-40 fibrils exhibit a higher Young Modulus due to a different conformational arrangement and fibril geometry
The previously mentioned results describe the importance of size effects in elucidating the mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils, as shown in case of different amyloid species
This issue is of great importance for understanding the molecular mechanism behind amyloid growth and proliferation, and it represents a fundamental piece of knowledge to compare computational and experimental results concerning mechanical performance of biological material.
Starting from the well consolidated knowledge about the link between mechanical properties of fibrils and the collective rupture behavior of hydrogen bonds that sustain the cross-β structure of Aβ complexes
The most relevant differences in interchain H-bonds between U-and S-shaped configurations are found along fibrils axis (Figure
Although the two models are characterized by the same number of H-bonds in the starting configuration, a different reaction to the applied deformation was observed during the stretching dynamics, with the Sarchitecture H-bond distribution assuring a better distribution of the stress over the interchain surface, and consequently a higher mechanical resistance.
It worth mentioning that, in this work, for the sake of a meaningful comparative analysis, the same protein region (residues L17-A42) has been considered for both U-shaped and S-shaped models.
The neglected domain is unstructured and not present in the U-shaped experimental model [2BEG
Instead, the experimental S-shaped model [2MXU
However, the presence of the E11-K16 structured domain may be reasonably expected to stabilize the interchain hydrogen bonds of protein region L17-V24, further increasing its superior mechanical performance revealed in this manuscript.
An evidence is given by Figure
Whereas, U-architecture rupture always begins in the central area (Ala30-Ile31), the Sarchitecture disruption starts at N-terminal tail (residues L17-V24) and the unrolling endures progressively to the C-terminal region.
Nevertheless, it was previously proved that the presence of the E11-K16 structured domain provide additional interchain hydrogen bonds in the protein region L17-V24 of the S-shaped assembly
Outcomes of the present work indicate that different fibrils architecture results in a different mechanical behavior alog the fibril axis.
More in detail, findings point out the attention on the S-architecture, indicating that the mechanical performance is markedly superior to the U-shaped architecture, at least for the case of small fibrils.
Apart from the scientific interest in amyloid biomechanics, this work may also stimulate further research on amyloid aggregation modulators.
Further studies might consider indication provided in this work for screening compounds able to destabilize the Aβ 1-42 assemblies, also considering the S-architecture as a target.
Based on the excellent agreement with previous experimental data, the SMD simulation-based approach presented in this work is a candidate of election as affordable benchmark platform for screening the efficiency of potential aggregation inhibitors aimed at destabilizing/reducing the stability of the Aβ fibrils.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present work, molecular modeling has been employed to investigate and compare the mechanical performance of the two different architectures proposed to describe the shape of Aβ 1-42 species .
Our results provided a clear evidence that the recently proposed S-shaped architecture shows superior mechanical properties with respect with the U-shaped motif due to a better distribution of the mechanical stress along the Sshaped motif.
Moreover, the observed findings and the excellent agreement with experimental data suggest the computational protocol here employed as an affordable tool for future design strategies aimed at destabilizing amyloid fibril for therapeutic applications of Alzheimer Disease.
This work does not pretend to be an exhaustive overview about Aβ fibril mechanics.
Conformational stability and mechanical performance of amyloid structures depends on a complex interplay of multiscale phenomena from the single monomer to hierarchically aggregates.
Hence, Young's and Shear modulus characterization cannot be enough to provide a complete characterization even for a single structured fibril, which has been the focus of the present work.
In general, computational data from Steered Molecular Dynamics strongly depend on the imposed pulling velocity, which is the main parameter to consider in order to correctly evaluate the obtained as usually done in previous relevant literature
In the present study, three different velocities have been applied to carefully check the dependence of mechanical response on the choice of pulling velocity, showing that no marked variations (in both absolute and comparative values) of the quantified moduli were observed by lowering the SMD pulling rate under 0.01 A/ps.
It is worth highlighting that, for the sake of a meaningful comparative analysis, the same amino-acid sequence (residues L17-A42) has been considered for both U-shaped and S-shaped models, as done in our previous study
Whereas, the ignored protein domain is known to be unstructured and not present in the U-shaped pdb file (2BEG [12]), the S-shaped pdb model (2MXU
The presence of the E11-K16 structured domain is reasonably expected to strengthen the interchain hydrogen bonds, further increasing the stability of the S-shaped fibril assembly.
This evidence has been already demonstrated in recent literature
Further investigations are needed in order to better describe U-shaped and S-shaped fibrils rupture dynamics, when a consistent part of hydrogen bonds starts to be broken.
An interesting avenue for future studies could be the application of the computational platform developed in the present work to study the destabilization of U-shaped and S-shaped complexes with novel compounds, since despite extensive studies, drug after drug aimed at targeting Aβ has failed the clinical trials.
