Formulated Chinese medicine Shaoyao Gancao Tang reduces NLRP1 and NLRP3 in Alzheimer's disease cell and mouse models for neuroprotection and cognitive improvement
Amyloid β (Aβ) plays a major role in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The accumulation of misfolded Aβ causes oxidative stress and inflammatory damage leading to apoptotic cell death.
Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used in treating neurodegenerative diseases by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.
We examined the neuroprotective effect of formulated CHM Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang, made of Paeonia lactiflora and Glycyrrhiza uralensis at 1:1 ratio) in AD cell and mouse models.
In Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells, SG-Tang reduced Aβ aggregation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as improved neurite outgrowth.
When the Aβ-GFP-expressing cells were stimulated with conditioned medium from interferon (IFN)-γ-activated HMC3 microglia, SG-Tang suppressed expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) and 3 (NLRP3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, attenuated caspase-1 activity and ROS production, and promoted neurite outgrowth.
In streptozocin-induced hyperglycemic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic (3×Tg-AD) mice, SG-Tang also reduced expressions of NLRP1, NLRP3, Aβ and Tau in hippocampus and cortex, as well as improved working and spatial memories in Y maze and Morris water maze.
Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of SG-Tang in treating AD by moderating neuroinflammation.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia characterized by the presence of aberrant senile plaques in patients' brain
Senile plaques are composed of β amyloid peptide (Aβ), a proteolytic fragment of the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP)
Aβ displays a neurotrophic support on differentiating neurons, but at the high concentration in mature neurons, as in AD, is neurotoxic
Aβ oligomers or other highorder structures cause rapid influx of external calcium, oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory response, leading to apoptotic cell death
Treatment of AD is currently symptomatic, although trials aiming to reduce the production and burden of Aβ aggregation within the brain are underway
Inflammation has emerged as a central mechanism in AD and a potential therapeutic target for treatment
Studies have demonstrated that Aβ aggregation-linked neuroinflammation causes neuronal damage and clinical deterioration.
Microglia, a group of highly motile AGING phagocytes in central nervous system and frequently found in close proximity to Aβ aggregates in AD patients
Aβ binds to several innate immune receptors present on microglia, such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4 and TLR6
Microglial activation increases the production of proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Furthermore, inflammasomes, such as NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) and 3 (NLRP3), are also activated in brains of patients with AD
These observations strongly suggest that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD.
Lines of evidence suggest that herb medicine can reduce neuroinflammation, and thus could be a treatment for AD.
For example, Oenanthe javanica has various pharmacological and biological activities such as antiinflammatory
Extract of Flemingia philippinensis contains various isoflavones, which exhibit anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory activities
Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang), a formulated Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) made of Paeonia lactiflora (P.
lactiflora) and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (G.
uralensis), displays anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory activities for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative cell models
The integrative pharmacology approach also discloses the therapeutic mechanisms of Danggui-Shaoyao-san decoction, which is a formulation of BaiShao, DangGui, BaiZhu, ChuanXiong, ZeXie and FuLing, against AD
In addition, SG-Tang can reduce neuronal TBP aggregation and exert neuronal protection in spinocerebellar ataxia cell and mouse models
A network pharmacology-based study further discloses the active compounds and therapeutic targets of SG-Tang in Parkinson's disease (PD)
As Aβ is a validated target for developing therapeutic agents, we evaluated the potential of SG-Tang against Aβ-aggregation and neuroinflammation by our established Aβ-GFP-expressing SH-SY5Y cell model
The results showed the potential of SG-Tang to mitigate Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, providing a new drug candidate in treating AD.

RESULTS

Aβ aggregation inhibition and neurite outgrowth promotion of SG-Tang
In order to evaluate how effective SG-Tang can be in its use against Aβ aggregation, we treated retinoic acid-differentiated Aβ-GFP-expressing SH-SY5Y cells with different concentrations of SG-Tang (Figure
In this cell model, the level of Aβ misfolding was negatively correlated with GFP fluorescence intensity
The 1.2-5 µM curcumin treatment increased the green fluorescence intensity (109-144%, P = 0.043-0.005;
cell viability: 102-87%).
Treatments with SG-Tang at 1-100 μg/ml also increased the green fluorescence intensity (117-156%, P = 0.048-0.006;
cell viability: 104-96%) (Figure
In the analysis of oxidative stress, overexpression of Aβ also elevated the ROS level (181%, P < 0.001), while treatment with curcumin (1.2-5 μM) or SG-Tang (1-100 μg/ml) effectively mitigated the increased ROS (from 181% to 151-117%, P = 0.012-<0.001)
(Figure
Meanwhile, treatment of curcumin at 5 µM or SG-Tang at 100 μg/ml did not affect Aβ-GFP RNA level (P > 0.05) (Figure
The neuroprotective effect of SG-Tang was then evaluated by Tet-On Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells.
Overexpression of Aβ decreased neurite outgrowth (from 54 μm to 47 μm, P = 0.004).
The pre-treatment with curcumin (5 µM) or SG-Tang (100 μg/ml) effectively rescued this impairment of neurite outgrowth (from 47 μm to 56 μm, P < 0.001) (Figure
During the 7-day incubation of SG-Tang, there wasn't any toxic effect on cell survival (101% for 100 μg/ml treatment).
However, the cytotoxicity increased slightly for curcumin at 5 μM concentration (cell viability 86%, P = 0.007) in Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells.

IFN-γ-induced activation of human HMC3 microglia
To activate microglia, 100 ng/ml IFN-γ was applied to human HMC3 microglial cells for 24 h
IFN-γ treatment increased expression of markers for microglial activation, such as CD68 and MHCII (Figure
The production of NO in the culture medium was significantly increased by IFN-γ treatment (from 1.2 µM to 10.4 µM, P = 0.007), accompanying with increased levels of TNF-α (from 196.1 pg/ml to 408.6 pg/ml, P < 0.001), IL-1β (from 62.7 pg/ml to 112.3 pg/ml, P < 0.001) and IL-6 (from 203.9 pg/ml to 732.1 pg/ml, P = 0.002) (Figure
In the following experiment, in order to trigger the neuroinflammation in Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells, we used the HMC3 conditioned medium activated by IFN-γ (CM/+IFN-γ).

Effects of SG-Tang on conditioned mediumstimulated Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells
In AD brains, neurons are exposed to high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, for example, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6
To model this neuroinflammatory niche, we

SG-Tang was added to the cells for 8 h, followed by inducing Aβ-GFP expression with doxycycline (Dox, 5 µg/ml) for 6 days.
On day 8, GFP fluorescence, cell number, ROS, Aβ-GFP RNA and neurite outgrowth were measured.
(B) Assessment of GFP fluorescence and cell number with curcumin (1.2-5 µM) or SG-Tang (1-100 µg/ml) treatment (n = 3).
The relative GFP fluorescence/cell number of untreated cells (Untr.) was normalized as 100%.
(C) ROS assay with curcumin (1.2-5 µM) or SG-Tang (1-100 µg/ml) treatment (n = 3).
The relative ROS of uninduced cells (Dox-) was normalized (100%).

(E) Fluorescence microscopy images of differentiated Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells uninduced (Dox-), untreated (Dox+) or treated with curcumin (5 µM) or SG-Tang (100 µg/ml).
Neurite outgrowth and cell number were measured after TUBB3 (yellow) staining (n = 3).
Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
The relative cell number of uninduced cells was normalized as 100%.
P values: comparisons between induced (Dox+) vs. uninduced (Dox-) cells ( ### : P < 0.001), or treated (Dox+/curcumin or SG-Tang) vs. untreated (Dox+) cells (*: P < 0.05, **: P < 0.01, ***: P < 0.001).

applied CM/±IFN-γ to neuronal cells differentiated from Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells for two days (Figure
As shown in Figure
These up-regulations were further exaggerated after treating cells with CM/+IFN-γ (iNOS: 242%, NLRP1: 153%, NLRP3: 195%, TNF-α: 193%, IL-1β: 163%, IL-6: 286%; P = 0.049-0.001),
whereas treatment with SG-Tang at 100 μg/ml normalized the levels of these markers for inflammasome and neuroinflammation pathways (iNOS: 95%, NLRP1: 66%, NLRP3: 59%, TNF-α: 106%, IL-1β: 51%, IL-6: 121%; P < 0.001) (Figure
Furthermore, application of CM/+IFN-γ reduced GFP fluorescence (85%, P = 0.031), whereas SG-Tang treatment increased GFP fluorescence (109%, P = 0.004), reflecting the improvement of Aβ-GFP folding.
Consistently, the increased ROS and caspase-1 activity in CM/+IFN-γtreated Aβ-GFP SH-SY5Y cells were reduced by the treatment with SG-Tang (ROS level: from 212% to 105%, P < 0.001; caspase-1 activity: from 18 µM to 14 µM, P = 0.010) (Figure
Moreover, the neurite total length (from 42 μm to 30 μm, P < 0.001), process (primary neurite, a projection from the cell body of a neuron; from 3.9 to 2.8, P = 0.003) and branch (an extension from primary neurite; from 2.6 to 1.4, P = 0.002) of the differentiated neuronal cells were also reduced by overexpression of Aβ and CM/+IFN-γ treatment, whereas SG-Tang rescued these impairments (neurite length: from 30 μm to 36 μm, P = 0.009; process: from 2.8 to 3.4, P = 0.049; branch: from 1.4 to 2.1, P = 0.047) (Figure
These results show that SG-Tang could down-regulate inflammasome and neuroinflammation pathways.
Moreover, it could reduce ROS production and caspase-1 activity, as well as improve neurite outgrowth in Aβ-GFPexpressing SH-SY5Y cells inflamed with CM/+IFN-γ.

Effects of SG-Tang on spatial learning and memory impairments in 3×Tg-AD mice
We then used 3×Tg-AD mice to further explore the neuroprotective potential of SG-Tang in vivo.
The homozygous 3×Tg-AD mice display diffuse amyloid plaques in the neocortex and Aβ aggregation in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, cortex and amygdale, and demonstrate trivial deficits in Morris water maze at 6 months of age
Therefore, we injected STZ intraperitoneally into 6-month-old 3×Tg-AD mice (Figure
As shown in Figure
Repeated measures of twoway ANOVA displayed a significant effect of day (F = 83.44,
P < 0.001) and treatment (F = 212.4,
P < 0.001) on blood glucose.
A significant treatment × day interaction (F = 18.56,
P < 0.001) was also found.
Even though SG-Tang treatment reduced blood glucose on days 22-29 (from 284-314 mg/dl to 230-193 mg/dl, P = 0.040-0.002),
the blood glucose levels in STZ/SG-Tang group remained significantly increased (191-230 mg/dl) in comparison to the normoglycemic group (-STZ, 105-112 mg/dl) (P < 0.001) on days 15-29.
There wasn't any significant change of body weight was observed among groups.
Open field test performed on day 24 did not show any significant changes in travelled distance and inactive time of mice with STZ/SG-Tang treatment (Figure
Y-maze alternation rate, which evaluated the working memory, was reduced in STZ group compared to control group (-STZ) (54% vs. 62%, P = 0.039), while SG-Tang treatment improved the alternation rates (from 54% to 67%, P = 0.001) (Figure
In order to evaluate the effect of SG-Tang on spatial learning and memory, we performed Morris water maze task in different phases: training (day 30-33), testing (day 34) and probe (day 36) trials.
As shown in Figure
Repeated measures of ANOVA disclosed a significant effect of day (F = 92.24,
P < 0.001) and treatment (F = 7.098, P = 0.0096) on the latency without AGING significant treatment × day interaction (F = 1.231,
P = 0.3161).
Testing trial also showed longer latency in STZ treated mice compared to normal control (-STZ) (39 s vs. 24 s, P = 0.002), whereas SG-Tang treatment consistently reduced the latency (from 39 s to 25 s, P = 0.004).
In probe trial, the STZ-treated mice spent less time in the target quadrant than normal control (-STZ) (17 s vs. 26 s, P = 0.002).
SG-Tang treatment increased the time spent in the target quadrant (from 17 s to 23 s, P = 0.022).
These results show that SG-Tang has a positive impact on the working and spatial memories for the STZ-treated 3×Tg-AD mice.

SG-Tang reduced Aβ and Tau levels in STZ-treated 3×Tg-AD mice
Besides cognitive function, we examined NeuN (RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog (C.
elegans) 3), Aβ and Tau levels in 3×Tg-AD mice with STZ/SG-Tang treatment.
In immunohistochemical analysis, STZ treatment reduced NeuN level in dentate gyrus (DG; 92%, P = 0.028) and Cornu Ammonis areas 1 (CA1; 90%, P = 0.003) and 3 (CA3; 93%, P = 0.043) of the hippocampus of 3×Tg-AD mice (STZ group).
Meanwhile, SG-Tang treatment could mitigate this decrease to 96-98%, although not significantly (P > 0.05) (Figure
However, STZ treatment increased expression of Aβ (intensity: 108-112%, P = 0.032-<0.001;
area: 134-194%, P = 0.071-<0.001) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, whereas SG-Tang treatment reduced the levels of Aβ (intensity: 88-110%, P = 0.038-<0.001;
area: 88-172%, P = 0.012) (STZ/SG-Tang group) (Figure
Consistently, STZ treatment increased expression of Tau (intensity: 117%, P < 0.001; area: 202-214%, P < 0.001) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, whereas SG-Tang treatment normalized the levels of Tau (intensity: 101-112%, P = 0.011-<0.001;
area: 146-106%, P = 0.023-<0.001)
(Figure
These results demonstrated the abnormal accumulations of Aβ and Tau in the  AGING µg/ml) next day for 8 h, followed by doxycycline (Dox, 5 µg/ml) addition to induce Aβ-GFP expression.
On day 6, DMEM-F12 medium without retinoic acid addition (-RA) was mixed with HMC3 conditioned medium (CM/±IFN-γ, 1:1 ratio) and added to the cells for 2 days.
(B) iNOS, NLRP1, NLRP3, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, (C) ROS production, GFP fluorescence and caspase-1 activity, (D) neurite length, process and branch were assessed on day 8 (n = 3).
For normalization, the relative iNOS, NLRP1, NLRP3, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and ROS levels in uninduced and CM/-IFN-γ stimulated cells were set as 100%.
P values: comparisons between induced (Dox+, + CM/-IFN-γ) vs. uninduced (Dox-,+ CM/-IFN-γ) cells ( # : P < 0.05, ## : P < 0.01, ### : P < 0.001), induced and inflamed (Dox+, + CM/+IFN-γ) vs. induced (Dox+, + CM/-IFN-γ) cells ( & : P < 0.05, && : P < 0.01), induced and inflamed (Dox+, + CM/+IFN-γ) vs. uninduced (Dox-, + CM/-IFN-γ) cells ( $$ : P < 0.01, $$$ : P < 0.001), or SG-Tang treated (+ CM/+IFN-γ, +SG-Tang) vs. untreated (+ CM/+IFN-γ) cells (*: P < 0.05, **: P < 0.01, ***: P < 0.001).

hippocampus and cerebral cortex of STZ-treated 3×Tg-AD mice, and what is more SG-Tang treatment could reduce these important AD phenotypes.

SG-Tang mitigated NLRP1 and NLRP3 expression in STZ-treated 3×Tg-AD mice
We further examined the changes in inflammasome pathway in STZ-treated 3×Tg-AD mice (Figure
STZ application raised NLRP1 (179-155%, P < 0.001) and NLRP3 (177-189%, P < 0.001) levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of 3×Tg-AD mice (STZ group), whereas SG-Tang treatment normalized these abnormal up-regulations to 106-95% in NLRP1 (P < 0.001) and 122-110% in NLRP3 (P = 0.001-<0.001).
These results demonstrated the potential of SG-Tang to reduce neuroinflammation in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Accumulated evidence has shown misfolded proteins aggregates as a trigger for chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration
Aβ can bind to several innate immune receptors present on microglia
The paracrine effects of these mediators further affect neurite outgrowth by activating inflammasome
P. lactiflora and G. uralensis, the components of SG-Tang, have been used traditionally to alleviate oxidation, inflammation and strengthen cytoprotection.
P. lactiflora or its active compound paeoniflorin has exerted the beneficial effects in rodent models relevant to AD
G. uralensis has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities in macrophages and hepatocytes
AGING SG-Tang has been used to inhibit chemokine activity in keratinocytes
Here we find that SG-Tang demonstrates neuroprotection against Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation, particularly targeting inflammasome, in cell and animal models of AD.
Inflammasomes are cytosolic protein complexes that promote the maturation and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators
Reports have indicated the priming and activation of inflammasome receptors, such as NLRP1 and NLRP3, in neurons.
NLRP1 inflammasome complex is up-regulated in rat cortical neurons after traumatic brain injury, stroke and hippocampal aging
In the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, the activation of NLRP3 induces the production of IL-1β and IL-6
Knockout of NLRP3 on APP/PS1 mice reduces impairment of spatial memory and enhances Aβ clearance
Our results also demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines in CM/+IFN-γ potentiated the up-regulation of iNOS, NLRP1, NLRP3, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and caspase-1 activity, as well as impairment of neurite outgrowth by Aβ overexpression, while SG-Tang treatment normalized the expressions of NLRP1/NLRP3 pathways and improved the neurite outgrowth (Figure
In STZ-treated 3×Tg-AD, SG-Tang treatment further improved working and spatial memories (Figure
These findings further support the potentials of SG-Tang as NLRP1/NLRP3 inhibitors for treating AD.
The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by ATP and certain bacterial toxins
The activation of NLRP3 pathway can be a two-step process.
In priming, the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β are increased.
This transcriptional up-regulation can be induced through engaging TLRs
Upon activation, NLRP3 causes proteolytic production of active caspase-1, which leads to conversion of IL-1β and IL-18 inactive precursors into their mature, active forms
It has been shown that Aβ could directly interact with NLRP3, leading to the activation of the NLRP3
Our results further demonstrated that Aβ also upregulated the expression of NLRP3 in the neuronal cells differentiated from SH-SY5Y, indicating its priming effect on inflammasome, and SG-Tang could normalize the priming and activation of NLRP3 in neurons.
Our results also showed that Aβ and CM/+IFN-γ upregulated the expression of NLRP1 (Figure
Inflammasome complex consisting of NLRP1 and the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) can also recruit and activate caspase-1
NLRP1 can be activated by anthrax lethal toxin
Interestingly, cerebral NLRP1 levels in APP/PS1 AD mice are upregulated, while knockdown of NLRP1 can improve cognitive functions
Our results suggested that Aβ and CM/+IFN-γ could upregulate the expression of NLRP1, while SG-Tang normalized the up-regulation of NLRP1.
Further study will be warranted to identify the activators of NLRP1 in CM/+IFN-γ, as well as the regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome by SG-Tang.
IFN-γ, a cytokine critical for innate and adaptive immune responses against viral and protozoal infections, activates HMC3 to release pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 (Figure
In murine macrophages, TNF-α induces NLRP3 expression and thus priming the NLRP3 inflammasome for subsequent activation
Overexpression of TNF-α in 3×Tg-AD mice enhances intracellular levels of Aβ and Tau, as well as learning and memory deficits
Inhibition of TNF-α can reduce cognitive deficits induced by Aβ
Therefore, the high concentration of TNF-α in CM/+IFN-γ could activate NLRP3 in our neuronal cells differentiated from SH-SY5Y cells (Figure
IFN-γ also regulates the secretion of IL-1β
On the other hand, the maturation of IL-1β is tightly controlled by NLRP3
IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, regulates inflammation in inflammasome-independent manner
However, blockage of IL-6 signaling blunts the activation of NLRP3 in diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice
Therefore, the high level of IL-6 in CM/+IFN-γ could also contribute to the up-regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in neuronal cells differentiated from SH-SY5Y cells (Figure
Two main active components, paeoniflorin and ammonia glycyrrizinate, have been identified in SG-Tang
Paeoniflorin is known to exhibit a beneficial therapeutic effect via reducing neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 and PS2 AD mice
It also exerts anti-aggregation effect on SCA3 model
Glycyrrizinate can reduce activation of microglia by Aβ
In SCA3 cell model, it further demonstrates neuroprotective potentials against aggregation formation and upregulates anti-oxidative pathway
Both paeoniflorin and glycyrrizinate are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
The transgenic expressions of APP/Tau and hyperglycemia in 3×Tg-AD mice last the depositions of AGING Aβ/Tau, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
Therefore, it is possible that sustained SG-Tang treatment is necessary to attenuate the neurodegeneration, whereas short-term exposure of SG-Tang is not likely to demonstrate neuroprotective effects in this AD model.
Future study will be warranted to confirm the temporal therapeutic window of SG-Tang treatment in AD.

CONCLUSION
In this study, we have provided evidence that NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways can be upregulated by microglia-derived pro-inflammatory factors and Aβ overexpression.
SG-Tang could serve as a neuroprotective strategy against Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation via down-regulating the NLRP1/NLRP3 pathways.
Our results consolidate the role of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis, impacting the treatment for AD targeting inflammasome.
Future work with large sample sizes will be warranted to strengthen the conclusions and uncover the main constituents and more mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of SG-Tang.

Caspase-1 activity in cells was examined by ICE fluorometric assay kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA), with FLx800 fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek) at 400/505 nm for excitation/emission.

Western blot
Total proteins were prepared using lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA pH8.0, 1 mM EGTA pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).
Proteins (20 µg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Sigma-Aldrich).
The membrane was blocked by 3% BSA for 20 min, probed with anti-iNOS (1:500; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-NLRP1 (1:500; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA), anti-NLRP3 (1:500; Cell Signaling), anti-TNF-α (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-IL-1β (1:1000; Abcam), anti-IL-6 (1:1000; Abcam), or anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (1:1000; MDBio Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) antibodies.
After washed twice with PBS, the membrane was treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000; GeneTex, Irvive, CA, USA) and the chemiluminescent substrate (Millipore).

Animal studies
Mice harboring APPSwe, presenilin 1 (PS1)M146V and microtubule associated protein tau (Tau)P30IL transgenes (3×Tg-AD, 004807)
Mice were maintained at 20-25° C and 60% relative humidity under a daily light/dark (12 h/12 h) cycle in the Animal House Facility of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), Taipei, Taiwan.
Four-month-old mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups: no treatment, treatment with STZ, and treatment with STZ/SG-Tang (n = 10 in each group).
To accelerate the development of AD phenotypes
SG-Tang (0.4%) was added to drinking water for 14 weeks (from day -60 to day 38) in STZ/SG-Tang group.
Mouse body weight and blood glucose level were measured every week.
All animal procedures, followed the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines, were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NTNU (Permit Number: 103002).

Behavioral analyses
To conduct the open field test, the mouse was placed in the center of an open-field box (30 cm long, 30 cm high, and 30 cm wide) to freely explore the box for 10 min.
The routes were recorded by a video camera mounting on the ceiling above the box, and analyzed by PhenoTracker (TSE system, Thuringia, Germany).
For the Y-maze, the mouse was placed in one of the arm compartments (40 cm long, 30 cm high, and 15 cm wide) for 8 min.

AGING
The water maze apparatus was composed of a whiteopaque painted circular pool (diameter 100 cm and height 76 cm) with a submerged platform (1 cm below the water surface) and 4 cues providing landmarks in the testing room.
The pool was filled up with water (24-26° C, 35 cm high).
For pretraining, the mouse was placed in the pool for 60 sec.
After three trials of pretraining, the mouse was placed on the platform in the center of the pool for 20 sec.
For training, the platform was placed in a quadrant with a cue.
The mouse was placed in the pool semi-randomly.
The trial ended either when the mouse climbed onto the platform or when 60 seconds had elapsed, and then the mouse was placed on the platform and faced the cue for 20 sec.
Four training trials were applied for 4 days.
Three testing trials were given to the mouse to assess the time to climb onto the platform.
The probe trials, by putting the mouse to the pool with no the platform for one min, were given 48 h later to record the time spent in the target quadrant of previous platform.
The data were collected by a video camera suspended 250 cm above the center of the pool, and analyzed by PhenoTracker.

Immunohistochemistry and image analysis
Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4° C. Brain sections (30 µm) were coronally cut by Leica RM2125 RTS cryostat (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
Heat-induced antigen retrieval for immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using antigen retrieval buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Brain sections were pretreated with 1% H2O2 for 15 min, and then incubated with anti-NeuN, anti-Aβ, or anti-Tau antibodies (1:100; Bioss Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) overnight at 4° C. The sections were washed twice by PBS.
The bindings of antibodies were detected by UltraVision™ Quanto detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The sections were also stained with hematoxylin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), dehydrated by ethanol and xylene (Sigma-Aldrich), and mounted by Micromount (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
All image analysis were performed using IHC toolbox plugin of ImageJ

Statistical analysis
All quantitative data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation.
Three independent tests in two or three biological replicates were performed in each experiment.
Differences between groups were compared by two-tailed Student's t test or one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Tukey test.
P values < 0.05 were statistically significant.
