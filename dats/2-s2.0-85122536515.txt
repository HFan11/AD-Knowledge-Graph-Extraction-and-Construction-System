An Electrochemiluminescence Biosensor for the Detection of Alzheimer’s Tau Protein Based on Gold Nanostar Decorated Carbon Nitride Nanosheets
Human Tau protein is the most reliable biomarker for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the assay to detect low concentrations of tau protein in serum is a great challenge for the early diagnosis of AD.
This paper reports an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for Tau protein in serum samples.
Gold nanostars (AuNSs) decorated on carbon nitride nanosheets (AuNS@g-CN nanostructure) show highly strong and stable ECL activity compared to pristine CN nanosheets due to the electrocatalytic and surface plasmon effects of AuNSs.
As a result of the strong electromagnetic field at branches, AuNSs showed a better ECL enhancement effect than their spherical counterpart.
For the fabrication of a specific immunosensor, immobilized AuNSs were functionalized with a monoclonal antibody specific for Tau protein.
In the presence of Tau protein, the ECL intensity of the immunosensor decreased considerably.
Under the optimal conditions, this ECL based immunosensor exhibits a dynamic linear range from 0.1 to 100 ng mL -1 with a low limit of detection of 0.034 ng mL -1 .
The LOD is less than the Tau level in human serum; thus, this study provides a useful method for the determination of Tau.
The fabricated ECL immunosensor was successfully applied to the detection of Tau, the biomarker in serum samples.
Therefore, the present approach is very promising for application in diagnosing AD within the early stages of the disease.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative illness.
The number of people suffering from the disease will increase-with the rapidly aging world population.
It is expected that AD is going to affect 115 million people worldwide if no effective therapeutic strategies are developed by 2050.
AD-related pathophysiological symptoms can be observed as early as 10-20 years before the emergence of cognitive impairment
Most of the AD biomarkers appear in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
However, the CSF sampling route is difficult, expensive, and invasive, making it inconvenient for largescale or repetitive sampling in a long-time following disease progression or treatment efficacy.
Human Tau protein is a promising serum biomarker for AD-that has gained significant attention for early and accurate molecular diagnostics
However, the serum concentrations of Tau protein biomarkers are at the pg/mL level, and ultrahigh-sensitivity detection methods are in great demand for clinical applications.
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL), also called electrogenerated chemiluminescence, converts the input electrical signal into optical readout, which is different from most other electrochemical methods
In fact, ECL relies on the generation of luminophore in the vicinity of the electrode surface by applying voltage.
Then, these electronically excited luminophores participate in high-energy electron-transfer reactions to emit luminescent signals
ECL represents a valuable marriage of electrochemistry and spectroscopy and displays unique advantages over other optical methods, including fluorescence and chemiluminescence (CL).
First and foremost, the absence of an excitation pathway not only facilitates the detection setup but also diminishes the fluctuation in the traditional fluorimetric techniques, thus leading to high sensitivity.
Second, the advantages of chemiluminescence are maintained in ECL methods.
Furthermore, the electrochemical reaction in ECL permits the time and location of the light-emitting reaction to be controlled.
This advantage leads to improved sensitivity, specificity, and reliability compared to CL.
Third, ECL is more selective than CL because the production of excited species can be easily controlled by varying the electrode potentials
Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are extensively utilized as the sensitivity enhancement components of biosensors due to their unique photochemical properties
Recently, anisotropic AuNPs such as nanocubes, nanowires, and nanostars have received significant attention since they have unique and often better optical and electronic properties than spherical NPs
Gold nanostars (AuNSs) have a circular structure with sharp protruding branches
AuNSs display modulated plasmon resonance because their multiple sharp tips could act as "hot spots" and amplify the local electromagnetic fields considerably.
Applications of AuNSs for amplifying response signals of surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based immunosensors are reported frequently in the literature
At present, the available detection methods for Tau protein are based in large part on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Despite the restrictions of the conventional ELISA, alternative methods have rarely been reported for the detection of Tau in plasma.
In a pioneering study, a multichannel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) platform was applied for the detection of human Tau in undiluted plasma
Dan Tao et al. reported a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of Tau in human serum with a limit of detection of 0.70 picomolar
An electrochemical biosensor was developed on an interdigitated wave-shaped electrode via an activated and self-assembled monolayer to immobilize a specific antibody for the detection of tau at picomolar levels
To our best knowledge, the ECL application has not been reported in Tau protein detection.
Furthermore, a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and ECL can be an effective way to amplify the signal intensity, and LSPR induced PL enhancement has been used as a sensitive analytical technique.
As a semiconductor two-dimensional (2D) material, Graphite-like carbon nitride nanosheets (g-CN nanosheets) have received great attention in both fundamental and applied scientific investigations.
g-CN nanosheets possess intriguing advantages, including good biocompatibility, excellent surface area, stability, and medium bandgap, thus extending huge potential applications as ECL emitter candidates.
However, surface modification of the electrodes with pure g-CN nanosheets reduces the conductivity of modified electrodes and produces weak and unstable ECL emissions.
For improving the ECL properties of g-CN nanosheets, it has been appropriately functionalized with some nanomaterials.
For example, an ECL biosensor was constructed based on Au NPs decorated g-CN nanosheets to quantify carcinoembryonic antigen with excellent sensitivity (LOD: 6.8 pg mL -1 ), good specificity, precision, and stability
Our group reported an ECL immunosensor based on AuNSs and g-CN nanosheets for the quantification of CD133 peptide with a LOD of 0.257 ng mL -1
In this report, an ECL immunosensor based on an AuNS functionalized g-CN nanostructure (AuNS@g-CN) was developed for Tau protein detection.
The construction procedure of the suggested ECL immunosensor for Tau protein is displayed in Scheme 1.
The AuNS@g-CN nanostructure generated a stable and strong ECL emission.
AuNSs not only accelerated electron transfer in the ECL process but also served as the immobilization platforms for biomolecules.
Hence, the AuNS@g-CN nanostructure was combined with the Tau antibody via the Au-N and Au-S bonds and produced a selective immunosensor by specific recognition between the antibody and the antigen (Tau protein).
The ECL response is linear in the 0.1 ng mL -1 to 100 ng mL -1 of Tau protein concentration ranges, whit LOD of 0.034 ng mL -1 .
The real sample test demonstrated that the ECL method had good practicability for sensitive Tau protein determination in serum samples.
Thus, this method could prove valuable in diagnosing AD within the early stages of the disease.

Synthesis of Gold Nanostars
Gold nanostars (AuNSs) and AuNPs were synthesized as described in the literature
Details are given in the ESM.

Preparation of the AuNS Decorated g-CN Nanosheets (AuNS@g-CN Nanosheets)
AuNS@g-CN nanostructures were produced by the physical mixing of 1 mL of AuNSs suspension into 20 mL of g-CN nanosheet suspension (dropwise) and stirred gently overnight.
Finally, the resultant suspension was centrifuged, and the obtained product was washed with water successively.
The resulting AuNS@g-CN nanostructures were centrifuged and dispersed in PBS (pH = 7.4).

Fabrication of ECL Immunosensors
A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was polished repeatedly with alumina powder on a polishing pad and then rinsed thoroughly with water and ethanol.
Finally, polished and clean GCE was dried using nitrogen in a gas stream.
Next, 10 µL of the suspension of AuNS@ g-CN nanostructures was directly drop-casted on the cleaned GCE and kept at 40 • C for 30 min to form a thin film of AuNS@ g-CN nanosheets.
In the next step, the resultant AuNS@ g-CN nanosheet immobilized GCE was incubated with 10 µL of a Tau antibody (anti-Tau) (7.14 ng mL -1 ) solution and incubated at 4 • C for 12 h.
The covalent immobilization of the anti-Tau takes place via the covalent bond formed between the thiol and amine groups of the antibody and AuNSs.
Afterward, (GCE/AuNS@ g-CN nanosheets/anti-Tau) electrode was immersed in 0.1 M PBS to remove physically absorbed anti-Tau.
To block possible remaining active sites, the electrode was immersed in 10 µL of 1% BSA solution at 37 • C for 1 h and then washed by 0.1 M PBS thoroughly.
The immunosensor was applied for the quantitative analysis of Tau protein.
The ECL assays were performed as follows: First, 10 µL of Tau protein with certain concentrations was cast on the modified electrode and left to react with immobilized anti-Tau.
During the detection process, the specific sites of anti-Tau are identifed and connected to Tau protein when Tau peptide is present in the detection system (GCE/AuNS@ g-CN nanosheets/anti-Tau/BSA/Tau protein), resulting in the ECL signal.
The ECL measurements were carried out in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.5) and 0.1 M of K 2 S 2 O 8 .

ECL Behaviors and Feasibility

ECL Behaviors and Feasibility
The ECL performance of the pristine g-CN nanosheet, AuNS@g-CN, and the AuNP@g-CN nanostructure was evaluated by immobilizing the nanomaterials onto the polished GCE and scanning the potential from -0.2 to -2 V. Simultaneously, the ECL intensities were recorded in PBS (pH = 7.5) and a 0.1 mM K 2 S 2 O 8 solution.
As displayed in Figure
When the potential was swept to more positive values, g-CN nanosheets were reduced to g-CN -Nanosheets due to charge injection.
The reduction of S 2 O 8 2-generates the strong oxidant SO 4 -which is reduced by g-CN -Finally, the produced excited g-CN* emits luminescence in the electrochemical cell.
The relevant ECL reactions are given below: The ECL intensities obtained using AuNP@g-CN and AuNS@g-CN nanostructure systems (Figure
The mechanism of enhancement is attributed to the catalytic effect of AuNPs on the S 2 O 8 2reduction process
Moreover, the more effective enhancement of AuNSs systems from the special shape is due to the concentrate electron density around the spikes.
In addition, AuNSs show a strong LSPR effect concentrated around the tips of branches which remarkably amplified the ECL intensity by producing more charge carriers.
This enhancement mechanism has been reported in the literature

(conc tration of K2S2O8: 0.1 M, pH = 7.5 and concentration of PBS: 0.1 M).
To investigate the effect of sensor construction steps on the electrode, the cyclic v ammetry (CV) voltammograms were recorded for each stage in the presence of red standard (details are provided in the ESM).
As illustrated in Figure
The redox peak c rent decreased moderately after the immobilization of the AuNSs@g-CN nanostruct (red curve) on the electrode suggesting the high conductivity and active surface area the AuNSs@g-CN nanostructure.
When anti-Tau (blue curve) and Tau protein (gr curve) were consecutively immobilized on GCE/AuNSs@g-CN, the redox peak curre diminished considerably due to the resistance of anti-Tau antibody and Tau protein [3

Optimization of Experimental Parameters
Some experimental parameters were optimized to obtain high sensitivity in the E determination of Tau.
The five main optimized parameters include film formation te perature of the AuNSs@g-CN nanostructure on cleaned GCE, buffer concentration, T (a) ECL intensity-time curves of GCE/pristine g-CN nanosheet (blue curve) system, the GCE/AuNP@g-CN nanostructure system (red curve) and GCE/AuNS@g-CN nanostructure system (green curve), and (b) ECL intensity-time curves of GCE/AuNS@g-CN system (red curve), GCE/AuNS@g-CN/anti-Tau system (blue curve), GCE/AuNS@g-CN/ anti-Tau/BSA system (green curve), GCE/AuNS@g-CN/anti-Tau/BSA/Tau protein system (Tau protein: 0.5 ng mL -1 , purple curve) and AuNS@g-CN/BSA/Tau protein system (Tau protein: 1 ng mL -1 , yellow curve).
(concentration of K 2 S 2 O 8 : 0.1 M, pH = 7.5 and concentration of PBS: 0.1 M).
The ECL intensity of different steps was investigated to consider the stepwise assembly procedure of the constructed immunosensor (Figure
The bare GCE modified with AuNS@g-CN nanosheets (GCE/AuNS@g-CN) showed a distinct cathodic ECL emission observed at a potential around -1.2 V (blue curve), indicating good electron conductivity of the GCE/AuNS@g-CN electrode
Afterward, with the immobilization of anti-Tau (GCE/AuNS@g-CN/anti-Tau) and BSA (GCE/AuNS@g-CN/anti-Tau/BSA), the ECL intensities displayed a significant decrease due to an obvious decrease in conductivity (respectively blue and green curves), suggesting the successful immobilization of these non-conductive biomolecules on the electrodes.
When the GCE/AuNS@g-CN/anti-Tau/BSA electrode was incubated with Tau protein, the ECL intensity decreased significantly due to the steric hindrance of Tau protein (yellow curve).
Without grafting of the anti-Tau step on the electrode, whenever it was incubated with only Tau protein, the cathodic ECL dropped slightly (purple curve), confirming the effective interactions between Tau protein and anti-Tau.
These results confirm the successful construction of the ECL sensor.
To investigate the effect of sensor construction steps on the electrode, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) voltammograms were recorded for each stage in the presence of redox standard (details are provided in the ESM).

Optimization of Experimental Parameters
Some experimental parameters were optimized to obtain high sensitivity in the ECL determination of Tau.
The five main optimized parameters include film formation temperature of the AuNSs@g-CN nanostructure on cleaned GCE, buffer concentration, Tau antibody concentration, immune reaction time and temperature between the antigen (Tau protein), and the antibody (Tau antibody).
In our previous work, the optimum pH value for the GCE/AuNS@g-CN system, amount of AuNSs@g-CN nanosheets, and the K 2 S 2 O 8 solution concentration were obtained at 7.5, 10 µL, and 0.1 M, respectively.
To obtain a high and stable ECL emitter, the temperature for film formation of the AuNSs@g-CN nanostructure on cleaned GCE was studied within the range of 25-45 • C. As illustrated in Figure
The ECL intensity enhanced significantly with increasing the concentration of PBS from 0.03 M to 0.15 M (Figure
A sufficient amount of antibody ensures the complete target analyte capturing on the biosensor interface.
As displayed in Figure
Incubation temperature has a significant influence on antibody and antigen reaction kinetics.
According to Figure
The investigation of incubation time for the reaction of antibody and antigen (Tau protein) reaction revealed that and 50 min was enough for the completion of the immune reaction (Figure
The stability of the ECL emitting materials is the most important parameter for analytical application.

Under 10 cycles of a successive cyclic potential scan, the ECL intensity was extremely stable, and the RSD was 3.3.
Furthermore, when the GCE/AuNS@g-CN immunosensor was stored at 4 • C, it was stable for more than 2 weeks, and the ECL intensity was 97.4% of the original ECL value after 2 weeks.

Subsequently, its ECL signal was obtained.
The tolerance limit was taken as the concentration of the added species causing less than 5% relative error.
The tolerable molar ratios were over 100-fold for all tested interferents.
