Graves' disease and toxic nodular goiter, aggravated by duration of hyperthyroidism, are associated with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.
A register-based long-term follow-up of two large cohorts (
with four controls according to age and sex using density sampling.
Hyperthyroidism was defined as either an ICD-10 diagnosis of toxic nodular goiter or Graves' disease, or two measurements of a TSH below 0.3 mU/l in the DNPR and OPENTHYRO registry cohort, respectively.
The primary outcome was all cause dementia, defined as either an ICD-10 code of dementia or prescription of medicine for dementia, with subgroup analyses of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Results:
The DNPR cohort had 56,128 patients with hyperthyroidism, 2,689 of whom were registered with dementia.
The reference population had 224,512 individuals, of whom 10,199 had dementia (HR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.12-1.23).
Risk of dementia, whether Alzheimer's or vascular, was higher in both Graves' disease and toxic nodular goiter.
The OPENTHYRO registry cohort constituted 2,688 hyperthyroid individuals and 10,752 euthyroid control individuals of whom 190 and 473 individuals, respectively, were subsequently diagnosed with dementia (HR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.89-1.26).
For each 6 months of decreased TSH the risk of all-cause dementia was significantly higher (HR 1.16; 95% CI: 1.12-1.22).

Introduction
Globally, dementia is an increasing burden to the health care system
In recent years it has become evident that identifying modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and smoking is of importance.
Whether hyperthyroidism could be such a modifiable risk factor for dementia is largely unknown.
Thyroid hormones are essential for optimal neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, and play an important role in the maintenance of brain development and function throughout life
In a meta-analysis of five cohort studies, including 7,895 individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism [defined as decreased (low) serum thyrotropin (TSH) and normal levels of thyroid hormones] followed for a median of 34 months, the investigators found a decline in cognitive function based on a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
In a recent magnetic resonance imaging study of 2,249 persons, higher serum concentration of free thyroxine (FT4) was associated with smaller total brain volume in the oldest participants, underscoring that thyroid function may influence brain morphology throughout life
Two large cohort studies, the Rotterdam study
Furthermore, the Framingham study demonstrated a direct association between the level of FT4 within the normal reference range and risk of dementia
Both of these long-term follow-up studies were population based and included otherwise healthy residents.
However, as a drawback, both studies had access to only a single measurement of TSH, FT4, or total thyroxine (T4) when categorizing the participants.
This is problematic knowing that thyroid function may vary over time and that the cumulative period of thyroid dysfunction considerably affects mortality and the risk of cardiovascular disease
Moreover, the above studies did not include overtly hyperthyroid individuals thereby rendering any conclusions as to the risk of dementia in patients with hyperthyroidism impossible
Patients with thyroid dysfunction, including both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, have increased somatic
Furthermore, hyperthyroidism has been linked to decreased quality of life and shortened lifespan compared to euthyroid individuals
We hypothesized that patients with hyperthyroidism, compared to euthyroid individuals, also have increased risk of being diagnosed with dementia.
Using the nationwide Danish health registries
Moreover, we explored whether the association between hyperthyroidism and dementia was influenced by the cumulative exposure time to hyperthyroidism.

Methods
The unique personal identification number issued to all inhabitants in Denmark, at birth or immigration, enables individual-level record linkage between different government based registries
The Danish National Patient registry (DNPR) includes primary and supplementary diagnosis for all in-hospital contacts since 1977, and outpatient visits have been available since 1995
DNPR has a coverage above 99%, and the overall positive predictive value of a diagnosis is above 95%
The Danish healthcare system is uniform, tax-financed, and covers all residents.
These conditions allow complete ascertainment and long-term follow-up of clinical conditions even with low base rates
The DNPR cohort has been described in detail previously
In brief, it includes all adult patients in Denmark registered in the DNPR with hyperthyroidism either due to Graves' disease (GD) or toxic nodular goiter (TNG) (n = 55,656).
For each patient four reference individuals (density sampled and matched for age and sex) were randomly selected from the Danish background population via the Danish civil registration system
Density sampling involves matching each hyperthyroid individual to reference individuals who are at risk (of hyperthyroidism) on the index date.
Any of the reference individuals can during the follow-up period develop hyperthyroidism, and enter into the hyperthyroid group and be assigned their own reference individuals.
This means controls could be sampled multiple times and cases could be sampled as controls prior to their date of being diagnosed with dementia.

that it ensures that the reference population is not too healthy when compared to the hyperthyroid group
Table
The index date was defined as the date where the hyperthyroid diagnoses were entered into the DNPR.
The OPENTHYRO registry cohort has been described in detail previously
In summary, this cohort consists of all individuals who had at least one TSH measurement done at the Odense University Hospital's Department of Clinical Biochemistry in the period of 1995 -2012.
The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism relied purely on biochemical data (TSH).
Patients were classified as hyperthyroid if they had a minimum of two decreased TSH values (<0.3mIU/L) within a period of 6 months, with at least 14 days between measurements, thus limiting the risk of including patients with transiently low TSH levels (e.g.
sick euthyroidism) into our hyperthyroid cohort.
For the current study, we matched hyperthyroid individuals with four euthyroid individuals for sex and age at first TSH measurement, using density sampling as described above.
Euthyroidism was defined as previously done by our group as a TSH between 0.3-4.0
mIU/L, overt hyperthyroidism was defined as TSH <0.3mIU/L and T4>135.0
nmol/L and/or T3>2.2 nmol/L (above reference range) and subclinical hyperthyroidism was defined as TSH < 0.3 mIU/L and T4 <135 nmol/L and T3<2.2nmol/L (9).
If we did not have data on thyroid hormone levels, the patient remained unclassified.
The index date was defined as the date of the first TSH measurement in the hyperthyroid individuals.
For both cohorts we used a one year wash-out period prior to study entry (excluding all participants registered with hyperthyroidism between January 1 st and December 31 st , 1995), thereby only including newly diagnosed cases (incident cases) of hyperthyroidism in the study.
We excluded all individuals (from both the DNPR cohort and The OPENTHYRO registry cohort and their relevant reference populations) with a dementia diagnosis entered into the DNPR, or starting a relevant drug to treat dementia prior to the index date.
This implies that if any participants were registered with a dementia diagnosis before Downloaded by University Library of Southern Denmark from www.liebertpub.com

the index date they would be excluded from the analysis.
If a hyperthyroid individual was excluded, due to dementia prior to the index date, we also excluded all matched controls for this individual.
If a reference individual was diagnosed prior to the index date, we only excluded that reference individual from the analysis.

Study Outcomes Measures
For both the DNPR cohort and the OPENTHYRO registry cohort all outcomes were defined in the same manner.
The primary outcome in the study was all-cause dementia, secondary outcomes were vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease and definitions are outlined in Table
The date of dementia was defined as either the date of the first entry into DNPR or the first dispensed prescription of relevant medication (cholinesteraseinhibitors, see Table
The burden of pre-existing morbidity was evaluated by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) on the index date, as described by Christensen et al.

Study Bias
Bias due to pre-existing morbidity in patients with hyperthyroidism is an important limitation.
Patients with hyperthyroidism more often than the reference population suffer from diseases which are also associated with the development of dementia
It is difficult to adjust for these factors in a statistical analysis as this will result in adjusting the fitted model for the exposure, in this case hyperthyroidism
In the DNPR cohort, the reference population is ascertained from the Danish background population.
As a consequence the reference population is 'healthier' than the hyperthyroid individuals and any difference in risk of dementia between groups could be due to varying distribution of risk factors for dementia, and not related to hyperthyroidism per se.
We minimized this bias by using a density sampling method to select reference individuals allowing hyperthyroid individuals to be used as reference individuals until they developed hyperthyroidism
Another approach to account for such a bias is comparing results from two different cohorts.
In the OPENTHYRO registry cohort all participants have had a blood test and thus at least one contact with a physician.
Although the indication for testing thyroid function was unknown it is reasonable to expect that euthyroid reference Downloaded by University Library of Southern Denmark from www.liebertpub.com

individuals from the OPENTHYRO registry cohort carry more morbidity than the general Danish background population.
Accordingly, similar results in the two cohorts likely indicate that thyroid dysfunction per se influences the risk of dementia, while different results in the two cohorts suggest an effect of co-morbidity.
Bias due to differences in baseline risk for dementia is also an important limitation in this study.
Sex and age are major risk factors for dementia and hyperthyroidism
We have, by design, taken this into account and matched our reference populations by gender and birth year (DNPR cohort) or gender and age at first TSH measurement (OPENTHYRO registry cohort).
While confounders such as alcohol and smoking habits were unknown to us, using the CCI our results are partly adjusted for liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to some extent a proxy for alcohol intake and smoking, respectively.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were done using Stata® 14.2 (StataCorp, USA) and SAS version 9.4.
Data are presented as mean [±SD], median [interquartile range], number of events, and percent of the population, as appropriate.
To evaluate the between-group hazard ratio (HR), we fitted a Cox proportional hazards model taking differences in pre-existing comorbidity into account, and a Fine and Gray (25) semi-parametric competing risk regression model, taking the competing risk of death into account.
The risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia between all hyperthyroid patients, patients with TNG, and patients with GD was evaluated.
Due to low incidence of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, we only performed the adjusted analysis for all-cause dementia.
HRs are presented as the HR between the hyperthyroid cohort and the reference population, accepting a significant HR if the 95% CI did not include the value 1.
The assumption of proportional hazards was evaluated by the log-log plot of survival for each group within each model used, accepting that the proportionality assumption held if the plots did not cross.

For the OPENTHYRO registry cohort, we furthermore used the TSH level as a time-dependent covariate using the array option in SAS ®.
The number of 6-month periods with TSH level <0.3mIU/L was incorporated as a cumulative time-dependent covariate in a Cox proportional hazards regression model, thereby taking alterations in thyroid status over time into account.
Any 6-month period in which no TSH measurement had been performed was considered a period with normal TSH.
Any 6-month period in which more than one TSH measurement had been performed, we used the average TSH for all measurements within the window.
In a subgroup analysis of the OPENTHYRO register cohort, we evaluated the risk of all-cause dementia in overt hyperthyroid and subclinical hyperthyroid individuals compared to the euthyroid reference population.

Results

The Danish National Patient registry cohort
Out of a total population of 2,634,844 registered with an ICD-10 diagnosis, we identified 56,128 patients with hyperthyroidism, 2,689 of whom were registered with dementia or had had a prescription for a drug used to treat dementia and was dispensed (Table

In the DNPR cohort a total of 2,217 (4.9%) individuals were diagnosed with dementia, compared to 7,907 (3.6%) in the reference population (HR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.12-1.23).
After adjusting for pre-existing morbidity, the risk decreased but remained significant (HR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07-1.19).
The HR for dementia, after correcting for the competing risk of death, was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03-1.14).
When stratifying according to the cause of hyperthyroidism both GD and TNG were associated with an increased risk of dementia (Table
The cumulative incidence of dementia was higher in hyperthyroid individuals than in the reference group, further underlining an increased risk of dementia in hyperthyroidism (Figure
Subanalysis by the type of dementia yielded essentially similar results.
Two hundred and eighteen individuals (0.4%) in the DNPR cohort were registered with a vascular dementia diagnosis, compared to 699 (0.3%) in the reference population (HR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.14-1.55).
Four hundred and eithy-six individuals (0.9%) of the hyperthyroid individuals and 1,595 (0.7%) of the reference population were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.17-1.45).

Risk of dementia based on degree of hyperthyroidism
In the overt hyperthyroid group, 105 (5.5%) were diagnosed with dementia, whereas 46 (9.3%) in the subclinical hyperthyroid group were subsequently registered with dementia.
There was no difference in the dementia risk between overt hyperthyroid individuals and the euthyroid reference group (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.66-1.10]),
whereas the risk of dementia was higher in the subclinical hyperthyroid group (HR 1.57 [95% CI 1.16-

2.13]).

Discussion
Utilizing population-based Danish health registries we have investigated two large patient cohorts with validated definitions of both hyperthyroidism
Using this approach, we found an approximately 20% relative increased risk of dementia in hyperthyroid individuals, which to some degree is explained by pre-existing morbidity.
Novel is also the finding that each 6-month period of decreased TSH was associated with a higher relative risk of dementia by 16%, suggesting that the longer a patient has hyperthyroidism the greater the risk of developing dementia.
The observed association between hyperthyroidism and dementia is biologically plausible, since thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of the amyloid-β and amyloid-β precursor genes
Furthermore, exposure to excess thyroid hormones has been shown to enhance neuronal death
In support of this finding, recent imaging studies have shown an inverse association between levels of T4 (within normal ranges) and brain volume in the elderly
Furthermore, thyroid hormone regulates hippocampal neurogenesis, and thyroid dysfunction may therefore negatively influence learning-ability, cognitive performance, memory and mood

impact of previous hyperthyroidism on cognitive function could be found.
In a prospective study in 31 newly diagnosed patients with GD, and a euthyroid age-matched reference group, the cognitive impairment seen during hyperthyroidism normalized after euthyroidism
Indicating that some of the cognitive impairment seen during hyperthyroidism may be transient.
The increased risk of dementia found in our study therefore is possibly caused by other pathways, e.g.
increased somatic and psychiatric morbidity.
Hyperthyroidism is caused by autoimmunity in GD
Since these differ with respect to age at onset, duration, and severity of thyroid dysfunction
Hypothetically, an increased risk of dementia could pertain to autoimmunity per se rather than the hyperthyroid state or vice versa.
In line with this, a variety of autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases, have been linked with increased risk of dementia
However, the fact that the risk estimates for being diagnosed with dementia did not differ between GD and TNG in our study support the notion that dementia is attributed to the hyperthyroid state rather than only to autoimmunity.
When interpreting the association between hyperthyroidism and dementia, it is important to note that hyperthyroidism is also associated with higher risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease
Thus, these comorbidity could, at least partly explain the association between hyperthyroidism and dementia.
Clearly our study, showing a decline in hazard ratios, albeit still statistically significant when adjusting for comorbidity, supports this.
On the other hand, our finding of a 16% increased risk of dementia for every 6 months of decreased TSH, in a sample where the hyperthyroid group and the reference individuals had equal frequency of cerebro-and cardio-vascular diseases, suggests that hyperthyroidism is an independent and modifiable risk factor for dementia.
There are many risk factors for dementia some of which, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, obesity, hypertension, and education level
This paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication, but has yet to undergo copyediting and proof correction.
The final published version may differ from this proof.
To minimize the effect of comorbidity, we adjusted our risk estimate analyses for pre-existing morbidity using the CCI.
The reference population in the OPENTHYRO registry cohort had more pre-existing morbidity than the reference population in the DNPR cohort.
This increased pre-existing morbidity in the OPENTHYRO registery cohort could in part explain why there was no significant difference in dementia risk between hyperthyroid and euthyroid individuals.
Our registery-based data contain inadequate information about smoking and drinking habits.
However, we adjusted our risk estimates for pre-existing lung and liver diseases and thereby, at least to some extent, adjusted for the effect of smoking and alcohol intake.
Eliminating differences in education level could reduce the risk of dementia by 8%
Lower education level in hyperthyroid individuals compared to a matched control group has been demonstrated
Since we do not have data on education level in our study cohorts, we cannot rule out that some of the increased risk of dementia is due to differences in education level.
The reason for the difference between overt and subclinical hyperthyroid individuals is most likely related to lack of treatment and longer duration of hyperthyroidism in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism as shown by us previously
Patients with overt hyperthyroidism have significantly more pronounced thyroid dysfunction than patients classified as having subclinical hyperthyroidism.
The consensus is to treat patients with overt hyperthyroidism, while many patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism do not receive treatment.
Thus, a potential increased risk of dementia may have been offset because of treatment.
The lack of data on treatment and the effects of treatment in the participants included in the DNPR cohort is a limitation.
Treatment of hyperthyroidism has a positive effect on mortality as well as on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease
It is likely, but at present unknown, whether treatment of hyperthyroidism also influences the risk of dementia in patients with hyperthyroidism.
However, our finding of a 16% increase in risk of dementia per six months of decreased TSH, irrespective of treatment status, supports timely and effective treatment and careful monitoring.
Any six-month period with no TSH measurement was considered as a euthyroid period.
This implies that a Downloaded by University Library of Southern Denmark from www.liebertpub.com

hyperthyroid individual may have been considered euthyroid during a period of disease, which would lead to an underestimation rather than an inflation of dementia risk in hyperthyroid individuals.
Another limitation is the lack of insight into the basis on which the diagnoses were made.
Registry-based studies are dependent on, and limited to, the decisions made by clinicians in their everyday clinical practice.
However, several studies have shown that the positive predictive value of diagnoses registered in the DNPR is high
The current study was furthermore limited by the age at first TSH measurement being lower in the euthyroid individuals compared to the hyperthyroid individuals in the OPENTHYRO registry cohort
We, therefore, matched hyperthyroid individuals by age at first TSH rather than birth year.
The window of observation was defined by the available data in calendar years, leaving the median observation time shorter in the OPENTHYRO reference group compared to the hyperthyroid individuals.
Dementia is a disease of the elderly, and it is likely that the shorter observation time could cause the lower incidence of dementia in the reference group.
However, the similar prevalence of dementia in the reference group in the DNPR cohort and the reference group in the OPENTHYRO registry cohort (3.6% and 4.4% respectably) indicates that this was not the case in our study.
Finally, due to the relatively low absolute risk of dementia found in the OPENTHYRO registry cohort, we cannot rule out that this cohort is underpowered.
There are several strengths to our study beyond including two cohorts with different ascertainment procedures.
Employing the DNPR cohort, we included all patients seen via the secondary health care system in Denmark.
This offered a cohort of participants with high capture and a high number of participants with near complete follow-up, at the expense of having no information on biochemical variables or the effect of treatment.
Therefore, we also included a cohort based on availability of laboratory data, including patients from the primary health care system (OPENTHYRO registry cohort).
This meant lower capture rate and number of participants.
A major strength lies in the utilization of two TSH measurements reducing risk of misclassification of hyperthyroidism because of transient thyrotoxicosis.
In fact, approximately 50% of patients with a decreased TSH have normal levels at repeat investigation
By including two different reference cohorts, one representing the general population and one representing a cohort   of more ill patients, we limited the risk of comparing a morbid group to a healthy group, and as a consequence showing an increased risk of dementia not related to the thyroid disease but to the differences in morbidity between hyperthyroid individuals and the reference population.

Conclusions
Using nationwide registry-based data, and employing two hyperthyroid cohorts, an approximately 20% relative increased risk, which is partially explained by preexisting non-thyroid morbidity, of being diagnosed with dementia is demonstrated.
For every 6 months of decreased TSH there is a 16% relative increased risk of dementia compared to individuals with normal TSH.
Further studies regarding the association between the phenotypes of hyperthyroidism and the subtypes of dementia, as well as the effect of treatment of hyperthyroidism on the risk of dementia, are warranted.

Number of hyperthyroid patients and reference individuals registered with a dementia diagnosis.
n(%); total number of events and per cent of the total population.
The crude model shows the Hazard Ratios (HR) comparing the hyperthyroid individuals to the reference population.
The adjusted for CCI shows the HR comparing the hyperthyroid individuals to the reference population, but adjusting for differences in CCI.
The competing risk regression shows the differences in Hazard Ratio between the hyperthyroid individuals and the reference population, taking the competing risk of death into account, in the hyperthyroid individuals.
