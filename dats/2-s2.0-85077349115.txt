Cofilin, a Master Node Regulating Cytoskeletal Pathogenesis in Alzheimer’s Disease
The defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are proteinopathies marked by the amyloid-␤ (A␤) peptide and hyperphosphorylated tau.
In addition, Hirano bodies and cofilin-actin rods are extensively found in AD brains, both of which are associated with the actin cytoskeleton.
The actin-binding protein cofilin known for its actin filament severing, depolymerizing, nucleating, and bundling activities has emerged as a significant player in AD pathogenesis.
In this review, we discuss the regulation of cofilin by multiple signaling events impinging on LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) and/or Slingshot homolog-1 (SSH1) downstream of A␤.
Such pathophysiological signaling pathways impact actin dynamics to regulate synaptic integrity, mitochondrial translocation of cofilin to promote neurotoxicity, and formation of cofilin-actin pathology.
Other intracellular signaling proteins, such as ␤-arrestin, RanBP9, Chronophin, PLD1, and 14-3-3 also impinge on the regulation of cofilin downstream of A␤.
Finally, we discuss the role of activated cofilin as a bridge between actin and microtubule dynamics by displacing tau from microtubules, thereby destabilizing tau-induced microtubule assembly, missorting tau, and promoting tauopathy.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia, accounting for ∼65% of all dementia cases
Two pathological hallmarks define AD brains, namely the accumulation of senile plaques composed of the amyloid-␤ (A␤) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles/neuropil threads composed of hyperphosphorylated tau.
A␤ is a peptide derived from the amyloid-␤ protein precursor (A␤PP) via two sequential proteolytic cleavages by BACE1 (␤secretase) and the presenilin complex (␥-secretase)
Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads are intracellular inclusions principally composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau in hyperphosphorylated form

In addition to A␤ and tau, multiple other proteinopathies are found in brains of AD and related dementias, including as ␣-synucleincontaining Lewy bodies

A␤ 42 AND TAU IN AD PATHOGENESIS
Evidence of an early causal role of A␤ (i.e., A␤ cascade hypothesis)
All APP FAD mutations identified thus far are concentrated near the ␤-secretase or ␥-secretase cleavage sites in A␤PP, which lead to increases in total A␤ or the more pathogenic A␤ 42 peptide
PSEN1 or PSEN2 mutations also increase the ratio of A␤ 42 to shorter A␤ peptides
A␤ 42 , while generated at less than 15% of A␤ 40 from wild type A␤PP in experimental cell models, aggregates faster and seeds the aggregation of A␤ 40
Transgenic mice engineered to produce only A␤
Furthermore, the BRI-A␤ 42 mice crossed with APP Tg2576 mice bearing the "Swedish" mutation exponentially exacerbates parenchymal amyloid burden
A␤ exists as soluble monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher order oligomers prior to assembly into protofibrils and insoluble amyloid fibrils
Indeed, the early folding properties of A␤
Soluble A␤ oligomers can induce synaptic dysfunction at picomolar concentrations, and SDS-stable dimers and trimers impair long term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo at subnanomolar concentrations
Furthermore, soluble SDS-resistant A␤ dimers derived from AD brains promote hyperphosphorylation of tau and neuritic degeneration in primary hippocampal neurons at picomolar concentrations
A mutation in APP identified in a Japanese family with dementia [deletion of residue 22 glutamic acid of the A␤ peptide (E22 )] produces an A␤ peptide that is more resistant to degradation, unable to form fib-rils, but is far more prone to self-association as A␤ oligomers
Expression of this APP mutation in transgenic mice leads to learning and memory deficits associated with impaired LTP, enhanced neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation in the absence of thioflavin S-positive amyloid plaques.
However, intracellular E22 A␤ oligomers accumulate in an age-dependent fashion, indicating that A␤ oligomers are sufficient and fibrillar amyloid deposition is not necessary for A␤-induced neurotoxicity and memory deficits
Numerous studies have shown that A␤ promotes the hyperphosphorylation of tau in vitro and in vivo
A␤ also enhances tauopathy in transgenic mice engineered to express a frontotemporal dementia (FTDP-17) tau mutation
Depletion of A␤ by injection of an antibody directed against A␤ reduces not only A␤ pathology but also tau pathology in the APP/tau/presenilin-1 mutant (3xTg) mice
However, despite the tauopathy promoting effects of A␤, the toxic effects of A␤ require the presence of tau.
For example, neurite retraction and progressive neuronal atrophy are seen when neurons are treated with A␤ but not in neurons derived from tau knockout mice
Learning and memory impairment as well as high sensitivity to excitotoxin treatment are present in mutant APP transgenic mice but not in the same transgenic mice on a tau-knockout background, even though the level of A␤ deposition is unaffected by tau
While A␤ induces impairments in LTP and axonal transport of mitochondria, such impairments are lost in tau knockout neurons
One of the earliest changes in tau observed in AD is the mislocalization of tau from somatoaxonal to somatodendritic compartments
Hyperphosphorylation of tau is linked to reduced affinity for microtubules and mislocalization to dendritic spines, where tau promotes the removal of surface AMPA and NMDA receptors critical for excitatory synaptic transmission
When expressed in neurons, tau lacking multiple phosphorylation sites fails to mislocalize tau to dendritic spines and affect excitatory synaptic transmission
Notably, like soluble A␤ oligomers, soluble hyperphosphorylated tau rather than insoluble tau aggregates may be the toxic species, since turning off FTD mutant tau expression in an inducible transgenic model does not remove insoluble PHF-1 positive tangle-like structures over several months but improves learning and memory

These results all indicate that A␤-induced toxic signals are transmitted via tau.
However, what might be a mechanism of transmitting A␤-induced neurotoxic signals from the cell surface?
A␤ oligomers rapidly promote the disassembly of microtubules but only in cells expressing tau
Moreover, the actin-binding protein cofilin is also required for A␤ oligomer-induced neurotoxicity
Multiple neuronal surface receptors for A␤ oligomers have been identified, including PrPc, NMDARs, mGluR5, IR/IGFR, LilrB2, ␣7nAchR, p75NTR, LRP1, integrins, and others
These receptors appear to function discretely as well as in coordination with each other to transmit A␤ oligomer signals via multiple signaling cascades.
In this review, we will highlight some downstream signaling events, focusing on the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal network.

ACTIN AND MICROTUBULE NETWORKS IN NEURONS
The highly polarized nature of neurons dictates their reliance on the cytoskeletal networks to define their morphology and the distribution of various organelles and proteins to specific polarized regions.
These cytoskeletal elements are composed of the actin (microfilament), neurofilament (intermediate filaments), and microtubule networks distributed in overlapping and discrete patterns throughout neurons.
While the actin and microtubule networks have been well studied, the neurofilament network is the least well understood.
Nonetheless, these intermediate neurofilaments are known to contribute to neuronal morphology and vesicular mobility
Actin filaments (F-actin) are concentrated in leading edge of non-neuronal cells
In a similar manner, F-actin is enriched in growth cones of immature neurons and in dendritic spines and presynaptic zones of mature neurons
In dendritic spines, F-actin crosslinks surface receptors as well as integral postsynaptic proteins such as drebrin and PSD95
In presynaptic zones, F-actin acts as a scaffold to mediate vesicular trafficking and regulates neurotransmitter release
Actin dynamics (polymerization, depolymerization, severing, bundling, etc.) continually regulate synaptic remodeling at both sides of the synapse and hence mediate changes in synaptic plasticity
Actin dynamics are regulated by several different pathways including the Rho family of small GTPase (RhoA, Rac1, cdc42), and various actin-binding proteins (ADF/cofilin, drebrin, profilin, Arp2/3, etc).
Of note, Rho family GTPases generally promote actin polymerization at leading edge of cells by cycling between the inactive GDP-bound to the active GTP-bound state, thereby regulating cell migration and growth cone motility
On the other hand, ADF/cofilin enhances actin dynamics through F-actin severing
The neuronal organization and distribution of microtubules are distinct from the actin network
Microtubules are polar structures polymerized from ␣and ␤-tubulin heterodimers that assemble into hollow tubules via the binding and hydrolysis of GTP
The fast-growing end is termed the plus end, whereas the slow-growing end is termed the minus end.
In axons, the plus end is directed away from the cell body toward the presynaptic terminal, whereas dendrites possess mixed populations of plus and minus ends pointing away from the cell body
Unlike the actin network, microtubules are not enriched at synaptic sites but can transiently assemble inside dendritic spines in an activity-dependent manner
The microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), which include MAP1A, MAP1B, MAPT2, MAP4, and tau, regulate the assembly, stability, and disassembly of the microtubule network
Microtubule dynamics play important roles in neurite extension, arborization, and dendritic spine morphogenesis
In addition, microtubules in neurons function as 'tracks' for transport of proteins and organelles along axons and dendrites.
These transport activities are mediated by motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein
This function is particularly important in long axons that require the long-distance anterograde transport of organelles such as mitochondria and synaptic vesicles as well as retrograde transport of dysfunctional mitochondria and misfolded proteins for autophagic clearance
As extensively illustrated in tauopathies, disruption of axonal transport is thought to play a key role in synaptic dysfunction in these neurodegenerative diseases

A␤, TAU, AND THE MICROTUBULE NETWORK
Tauopathy is induced by the detachment of tau from microtubules, associated with tau hyperphosphorylation
While A␤ is not required to induce tauopathy, as evidenced by multiple tauopathies lacking A␤ pathology (FTLD-tau, PSP, CBD, etc.)
As outlined above, A␤ oligomers promote the hyperphosphorylation of tau, leading to microtubule disassembly.
Multiple kinases mediating this neurotoxic action of A␤ have been studied, including GSK-3␤, MAPK, PKA, CamKII, Cdk-5, JNK, Fyn, AMPK, and MARK
Of at least 85 phosphorylation sites on tau
In addition, phosphorylation of tau on Ser214 and Thr231 are also associated with detachment of tau from microtubules
These tau phosphorylation sites are situated within the prolinerich domain or the adjacent microtubule binding repeat 1. Notably, the phosphorylation of Thr231, which undergoes trans-to-cis isomerization, is significantly increased in mild cognitive impairment
These and other phosphorylation sites play key roles in tauopathy.
However, it is important to note that hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD brains is far more extensive than that induced by A␤ in neurons.
It is still unclear whether the bulk of tau hyperphosphorylation seen in AD occurs before or after its detachment from microtubules.

COFILIN AND THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON
The assembly and disassembly of G-actin to Factin is a process critical to many cellular processes, including cell motility, migration, dendritic spine morphogenesis, as well as provision of physical force for membrane bending needed for endocytosis and exocytosis
F-actin is composed of two stranded helical polymers derived from the assembly of G-actin in a head to tail configuration, giving rise to its polarity (barbed and pointed ends).
Actin assembly is initiated by the rate-limiting nucleation step in which actin forms dimers and trimers.
The actin oligomer serves as a seed for elongation of filaments by the incorporation of ATP-actin monomers, after which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP with subsequent release of inorganic phosphate (P i ).
ADF/Cofilin, a family of actin-binding protein, is one of the key regulators of actin dynamics via its F-Actin severing, depolymerizing, nucleating, and bundling activities
Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation on Ser3 by LIM kinase1 (LIMK1)
In addition to phosphorylation, cofilin activity is also regulated by its interaction with the membrane polyphosphoinositide PI(4,5)P 2 , which inhibits cofilin binding to F-actin
Activated cofilin differentially modulates actin dynamics depending on the ratio of cofilin to actin.
At regions of high cofilin/actin ratios, cofilin can bind and stabilize F-actin in a twisted form, thereby promoting the nucleation of actin rather than severing
However, at regions of low cofilin/actin ratios, cofilin does not bind ADPactin fast enough to saturate F-actin but induces persistent severing to create new barbed and pointed ends
These processes mediated by activated cofilin greatly contribute to dendritic spine remodeling in neurons
Cofilin activity is facilitated by other actin-binding proteins, such as coronin 1A and Aip1, which can enhance cofilin recruitment to F-actin, increase cofilin severing activity, or accelerate monomer dissociation from F-actin

These points are specifically discussed in the sections below.

Cofilin-actin pathology
Actin-based pathologies including Hirano bodies
Specifically, a study by Rahman and colleagues reported a 4-fold increase in cofilin rods/aggregates in AD versus age-matched controls, which correlates with the extent of tauopathy
Previous studies have also shown that bioactive A␤ dimers/trimers at subnanomolar concentrations promote cofilin-actin rod formation in a subset of neurons associated with activation of cofilin and NADPH oxidase (NOX)
While it is not clear whether cofilin-actin pathology plays an essential role in AD pathogenesis, it is certainly a pathology saliently present in AD brains  and clearly serves as evidence for the deregulation of cofilin and actin in AD.
The formation of cofilin-actin pathology (rods and aggregates) requires several key events.
First, cofilin must be in the activated form (dephosphorylated), as SSH1 or CIN-mediated cofilin dephosphorylation and LIMK1-mediated cofilin phosphorylation promotes and inhibits cofilin-actin rod generation, respectively
Notably, phospholipase-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ), which locally releases active cofilin from the membrane, also dynamically contributes to cofilin activation
Second, activated cofilin levels must rise to saturate local regions of F-actin in the presence abnormally high levels of ADP-actin, which preferentially binds to cofilin
Third, cofilin must undergo intermolecular disulfide linkages via oxidation of several key cysteine residues
These cofilin-actin inclusions are generally reversible and can form under conditions of heat shock, osmotic stress, ATP depletion, excitotoxicity, ischemia, and oxidative stress, potentially interfering with axonal/neuritic transport and depleting activated cofilin needed for actin remodeling
For example, ischemia-induced cofilin-actin pathology interferes with mitochondrial transport and leads to synaptic failure, which could be partially rescued by LIMK1 or its upstream activator Rho

S137

Mitochondrial translocation of cofilin
Activated cofilin also plays an important role in mitochondrial dysfunction via direct translocation to mitochondria.
Upon oxidative stress, cofilin becomes oxidized on several cysteine residues, thereby promoting intramolecular disulfide bridging of cofilin
This causes cofilin to lose affinity for actin and translocate to mitochondria, where it induces swelling, drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release by promoting the opening of the permeability transition pore
In addition to cofilin oxidation, dephosphorylation (or activation) of cofilin is required for its translocation to the mitochondria and oxidant-induced apoptosis.
When oxidation of cofilin is prevented by cysteine mutagenesis, oxidant-induced apoptosis is also inhibited.
Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous cofilin by siRNA also inhibits both oxidant and staurosporineinduced apoptosis, indicating that cofilin is critical for mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
Woo and colleagues first demonstrated that A␤ 1-42 oligomers promote the translocation of cofilin to mitochondria, which induces a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in mitochondrial superoxide, and cell death.
These events are largely abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of cofilin
Liu and colleagues showed that activated cofilin forms a complex with the tumor suppressor protein p53, which promotes the translocation of p53 to both mitochondria and nucleus
Cofilin interaction with the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 has also been reported to regulate both mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis
In brains of AD patients, the level of mitochondrial cofilin is strongly increased compared to healthy agematched controls

LIMK1 and SSH1 pathways
A␤ has been shown to play important roles in cofilin deregulation and synaptic dysfunction via both LIMK1 and SSH1 pathways.
LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin generally involves upstream Rac-PAK signaling, which leads to cofilin inactivation.
PAK1 and PAK3 levels and activity are depleted in AD brains
Similar loss of drebrin is found in APP/PS1, Tg2576, and 3xTg transgenic models of AD
Zhao and colleagues found that A␤ 1-42 oligomers can directly induce PAK signaling deficits in primary neurons
Despite a general loss of PAK levels and signaling in AD brains, pPAK is intensely increased surrounding A␤ deposits together with cofilin pathology
Arsenault et al. confirmed the loss of PAK in AD brains and 3xTg mice and showed that expression of a dominantnegative form of PAK results in memory deficits in 3xTg mice
In contrast, Heredia and colleagues showed that A␤ 1-40 and A␤ 25-35 fibrils induce the activation of LIMK and resultant cofilin inactivation (phosphorylation), associated with dystrophic neurites in primary neurons
This finding may help to explain the intense pPAK staining surrounding the presumably fibrillar A␤ deposits in AD brains
Indeed, Ariadna and colleague showed the activation LIMK1 by A␤ 1-42 fibrils, but this was ically associated with increased cofilin activation, suggesting that A␤ 1-42 fibrils may act via bifurcating mechanisms of Rac-LIMK1 activation and perhaps also activation of the SSH1 pathway, the latter perhaps via Rac-mediated activation of NOX and oxidation of 14-3-3 releasing SSH1
RanBP9 is a scaffolding protein known to promote A␤ production
RanBP9 was shown to promote cofilin activation via enhancing SSH1 in primary neurons and in brain
RanBP9 transgenic mice also contain increased activated cofilin in synaptosomes
Conversely, genetic reduction of RanBP9 mitigates both amyloid and cofilin-actin pathology in APP/PS1 transgenic mice
Moreover, Kim and colleagues observed increased levels of cofilin activation in AD brains with no apparent changes in phospho-LIMK1
In the same study, the A␤ oligomer receptor LilrB2 was shown to mediate the activation of cofilin by A␤ 1-42 oligomers
The neurotoxic effects of A␤ 1-42 oligomers could be abolished by knockdown of SSH1, which also mitigates mitochondrial translocation of activated cofilin
In the same study, genetic reduction of cofilin was shown to mitigate the loss of drebrin and other Factin-associated synaptic proteins as well as deficits in synaptic plasticity (i.e., LTP) and memory in APP/PS1 transgenic mice
The role of SSH1 in A␤-induced cofilin activation is supported by a previous study showing that A␤-induced dendritic spine loss is mediated by calcineurin and cofilin
This is likely via calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of SSH1, which activates cofilin
The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both SSH1 and cofilin activation is highlighted by observations that oxidation of 14-4-3 releases both SSH1
Indeed, NOX-mediated ROS production is required for A␤-induced cofilin activation
Furthermore, direct oxidation of cofilin is also required for both mitochondrial translocation of cofilin
Despite the strong evidence for a role of cofilin activation and oxidation in AD pathogenesis, other studies have shown that cofilin inactivation may also play a role in AD pathogenesis.
In the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction of AD and APP/PS1 mouse brains, phospho-cofilin is increased, and short duration (30 min) A␤ 1-42 oligomer treatment promotes cofilin phosphorylation together with F-actin stabilization in dendritic spines
Another study showed that A␤ oligomers increase cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization selectively in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons but not in non-cholinergic neurons via a p75-dependent mechanism
In APP/PS1 transgenic mouse brains, phospho-cofilin is reduced at 4 months of age (early pathology) and then increased at 10 months of age (mid-late pathology)
Hence, different A␤ species and conformations appear to act on cofilin in differing ways, depending on the locality, age, and neuronal type.
This may not be entirely surprising, given the differences in the localization, affinity, and downstream signaling cascades coupled to perhaps a dozen known A␤ receptors expressed in different neuronal populations
In cultured hippocampal primary neurons, bioactive A␤ dimers/trimers induce cofilin-actin rod formation (which requires cofilin activation) in neurites of only ∼20-30% of neurons, while organotypic hippocampal slices treated with A␤ dimers/trimers preferentially increase cofilinactin rods in the dentate gyrus and the mossy fiber track but not in CA regions
Hence, the binding of A␤ species to different neuronal A␤ receptors may promote cofilin activation, while other receptors might respond in the opposite direction depending on A␤ concentration, type, and locality.
Despite the changes in phospho-cofilin seen by A␤ and in AD models, it is important to emphasize that the phosphorylation state of cofilin is not the sole determinant of cofilin activation status, as the local hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P 2 releases active cofilin from the membrane
This pool of cofilin is far more difficult to measure and has largely been ignored in prior studies.
Nevertheless, the observation that genetic reduction of cofilin rescues neurotoxicity

␤-ARRESTIN, CHRONOPHIN, AND PLD1
While ␤-arrestins are traditionally known for their roles in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) finetuning and desensitization, it is now widely accepted that ␤-arrestins act as multifunctional adaptor proteins that regulate multiple signaling pathways
For example, Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2)-mediated activation of cofilin requires ␤arrestin to scaffold together cofilin and chronophin (CIN), a cofilin activating phosphatase
This action appears to be localized to the leading edge of cells
Intriguingly, both ␤-arrestin1 and ␤-arrestin2 are significantly elevated in brains of AD patients, both of which promote ␥-secretase activity to enhance A␤ production in brain
␤-arrestin2 also plays an important role in dendritic spines and synapses via translocating activated cofilin to dendritic spines
Hence, ␤-arrestin2-deficient neurons are resistant to A␤-induced dendritic spine loss
The CIN/Hsp90 complex functions as an ATP sensor, and upon ATP depletion, CIN dissociates from Hsp90
This leads to CIN activation and dephosphorylation of cofilin, thereby promoting cofilin-actin rod formation under conditions of ATP depletion
Phospholipase D1 (PLD1), an enzyme of the phospholipase superfamily, catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) into phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline in response to various stimuli
PI(4,5)P 2 , which can be produced by PA-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5kinase (PIP5K), functions to both activate PLD1 and inactivate cofilin
Conversely, PLD1 reciprocally promotes cofilin phosphorylation / inactivation and inhibits cofilin-mediated mitochondrial toxicity
Hence, PLD1 and cofilin reciprocally regulate each other, adding another layer of cofilin regulation.
Interestingly, a previous study reported that PLD1 antagonizes A␤ production by regulating the ␥secretase complex

COFILIN IN TAUOPATHY
Early studies examining rod-like cofilin aggregates in primary neurons demonstrated 12E8 antibody immunoreactivity in a subset of cofilin-positive rods resembling neuropil threads.
The 12E8 antibody recognizes the pSer262/pSer356 of tau and other phosphorylated MAPs, suggesting that cofilin might coprecipitate together with tau and/or other MAPs in cofilin-actin rods
FTDP-17 mutant tau overexpression in transgenic mice and Drosophila has been shown to promote F-actin bundling.
These transgenic animal brains contain hyperphosphorylated tau in F-actin-containing rod-like structures, although the presence of tau in cofilin-containing rods was not examined
In AD brains, however, phospho-tau containing neuropil threads and cofilinactin aggregates do not appear to colocalize, despite the abundance of both structures in the same brains
Both tau and cofilin are required for A␤-induced mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction in primary neurons, and either cofilin or tau reduction also rescues defects in synaptic plasticity and memory in APP transgenic mice
So how might cofilin and tau signaling downstream of A␤ be reconciled?
Woo and colleagues recently showed that tau-microtubule complexes are decreased, and cofilin-microtubule complexes are increased in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, both of which are prevented by genetic reduction of cofilin
Experiments in vitro, cells, and in vivo suggest a role for cofilin in displacing tau from tubulin/microtubules, which inhibits tau-induced microtubule assembly and axonal transport
Remarkably, genetic reduction of cofilin strongly mitigates tauopathy (tau hyperphosphorylation & insolubility) and synaptic plasticity deficits in Tau-P301 S (PS19) mice, in which the 'activated' but not 'inactive' form of cofilin was found to mediate tauopathy, microtubule instability, and synaptic deregulation in the Tau-P301 S model
Hence, these findings show that activated cofilin can displace tau from microtubules, resulting not only in inhibition of tau-mediated microtubule dynamics but also tau hyperphosphorylation and tauopathy.
Intriguingly, Zempel and colleagues showed that the axonal initial segment (AIS) of neurons contains a tau diffusion barrier composed of actin filaments that normally keeps tau in axons by preventing its retrograde traffic back to the soma
A␤ oligomer-induced activation of cofilin at the AIS was found to dissolve the tau diffusion barrier, which allows missorting of tau to somatodendritic compartments
Hence, it is plausible that A␤-induced activation of cofilin, resulting in simultaneous displacement of tau from microtubules and severing of actin filaments (i.e., removing tau diffusion barrier), may underlie the mislocalization of tau from the somato-axonal to somatodendritic compartments, an early feature of tauopathy
It also raises the intriguing possibility that the local actions (i.e., dendritic spines, presynaptic boutons, cell body, and/or AIS) of A␤ oligomers or other neurotoxic insults produce defined and diverse consequences that could mark different components of A␤-cofilin-tau-mediated signaling in AD pathogenesis.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The findings generated from multiple studies implicate the critical role of cofilin in AD pathogenesis.
These may come in the form of cofilin-actin pathology, deregulated F-actin dynamics, mitochondrial translocation of cofilin to coordinate cell death pathways, and displacement of tau from microtubules, the latter which couples actin dynamics with tau-regulated microtubule dynamics.
The regulation of cofilin by multiple pathways interconnect different facets of AD pathogenesis, including A␤, tau, and the cytoskeleton, suggesting that the machinery of cofilin activation and inactivation cycle represents a key node regulating cytoskeletal pathogenesis in AD.
Hence, modulating cofilin activity could be a therapeutic strategy to slow multiple AD pathologies and mitigate synaptic dysfunction.
This may be achieved by regulating upstream effectors, such as LIMK1, SSH1, chronophin, and/or ␤-arrestin as an alternative to directly targeting A␤ or tau.



Fig. 1 .
Fig.1.
Schematic model of A␤-induced cofilin deregulation in AD.
A) Accumulation of A␤ oligomers impinge on various surface receptors (PrPc, Integrins, LilbR2, etc.), impacting several signaling cascades including Nox activation.
Nox-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) promotes 14-3-3 oxidation, thereby releasing and activating SSH1.
Scaffolding protein RanBP9 (Ran9) stabilizes and promotes SSH1-mediated cofilin dephosphorylation and activation.
Excessive cofilin activation can then result in several downstream consequences: 1. Together with increased ADP-actin, activated cofilin, & ROS, intermolecular disulfide bridging of cofilin induces cofilin-actin rod formation, potentially impeding axonal transport and depleting cofilin; 2. Intramolecular disulfide bridging of oxidized and activated cofilin loses affinity for actin and translocates to mitochondria to promotes mitochondrial dysfunction together with p53 and Drp1.
This causes ATP depletion, which releases chronophin (CIN) from hsp90 inhibitory control and further promotes CIN-mediated cofilin activation, which is enhanced by ␤-arrestin-mediated scaffolding of CIN and cofilin; 3. Non-oxidized activated cofilin severs F-actin, increasing actin dynamics and potentially damaging synapses by loss of drebrin and PSD95; and 4. Activated cofilin displaces tau from microtubules with the aid of MARK-mediated tau phosphorylation on Ser262, which when coupled to dissolution of the tau diffusion barrier by F-actin severing at the AIS, induces missorting of tau to somatodendritic compartments.
Displacement of tau from microtubules also destabilizes microtubules; 5. Hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-displaced tau by multiple kinases promotes tauopathy.
B) In some cases, A␤ species impinge on p75NTR or other surface receptors, either activating or inhibiting Rac-Pak signaling, thereby enhancing or limiting LIMK-mediated inactivation / phosphorylation of cofilin, respectively.
PLD1 plays a role in the negative regulation of cofilin by either inhibiting activated cofilin or increasing inactive/phosphorylated cofilin.
Inhibition of LIMK feeds into the SSH1-mediated cofilin activation pathway (1-5), whereas excessive activation of LIMK together with PLD1 may override the SSH1 pathway and promote deregulated cofilin inactivation, which can result in insufficient actin dynamics and synaptic rigidity
