Disentangling Heterogeneity in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementias Using Data-Driven Methods
Brain aging is a complex process that includes atrophy, vascular injury, and a variety of ageassociated neurodegenerative pathologies, together determining an individual's course of cognitive decline.
While Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative dementias (ADRD) contribute to the heterogeneity of brain aging, these conditions themselves are also heterogeneous in their clinical presentation, progression and pattern of neural injury.
We reviewed studies that leveraged data-driven approaches to examining heterogeneity in ADRD, with a principal focus on neuroimaging studies exploring subtypes of regional neurodegeneration patterns.
Over the past decade, the steadily increasing wealth of clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular biomarker

Understanding heterogeneity from brain aging to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
Brain aging is a complicated heterogeneous process that is associated with brain atrophy, cognitive decline, vascular brain injury, and a variety of age-associated pathologies
Recently, neuroimaging-based machine learning methods were developed to predict individual brain age from magnetic resonance (MR) images, which enabled exploration of the heterogeneity through deviation from normative brain aging trajectories
Currently, considerable attention is being given to understanding heterogeneity in brain aging and dementia using data-driven clustering methods combined with neuroimaging.
A recent report in a healthy aging cohort discovered five distinct subtypes of advanced brain aging using a data-driven clustering approach
One subtype resembled Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like changes, but the other subtypes were characterized by atrophy patterns suggestive of other neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the differential contribution of AD and related dementias (ADRD) to the deviation from healthy brain aging.
While comorbid ADRD contribute to the heterogeneity of brain aging, these conditions themselves are also heterogeneous in their progression and pattern of neural injury.
To date, most of the existing research on studying heterogeneity in ADRD departs from 'a priori' categorizations of recognized clinical or pathologic disease variants and aims to understand clinical and neurobiological differences between these variants (see
By contrast, the increasing availability of large-scale data sets over the last years has supported the development and application of clustering techniques for exploring disease heterogeneity in a less biased, data-driven manner.
Such data-driven discovery of previously unappreciated disease subtypes may lead to novel frameworks for more differentiated disease stratification that holds great promise for improving individualized diagnosis and prognosis.
In the present article we give an up-to-date overview of studies that leveraged data-driven approaches to studying heterogeneity in ADRD, with a principal focus on exploring subtypes of regional neurodegeneration patterns (Table
While most of these studies have focused on AD dementia and its clinical at-risk populations such as Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we also review the emerging literature on data-driven neuroimaging subtypes in frontotemporal (FTD) and Lewy-body dementia (LBD) for a comprehensive coverage of the principle age-related neurodegenerative dementias.
We put the neuroimaging-based subtyping findings into context of data-driven subtyping studies using other phenotyping data, particularly neuropsychological and molecular biomarker data.

Alzheimer's disease dementia 2.1. Heterogeneity in neuroimaging patterns: from hypothesis-driven to data-driven approaches
AD is commonly defined based on a characteristic amnestic-predominant dementia syndrome that is reflected by a stereotypic pattern of regional pathology progression that begins in the medial temporal lobe and extends into the temoroparietal neocortex
However, there are also well-recognized "atypical" clinical presentations that do not fit into this scheme, including a visuospatial variant, a language variant, and a 'frontal' variant with predominant dysexecutive deficits
Similarly, neuropathological studies have reported atypical patterns of neurofibrillary tangle distribution in subsets of patients, including a "limbic-predominant" subtype with relatively lower neocortical over medial temporal involvement, and a "hippocampal-sparing" subtype with the opposite pattern
Several previous studies on understanding heterogeneity in neuroimaging patterns of AD have used a hypothesis-driven design
This approach could provide important information on differential clinical, biomarker, and prognostic characteristics of these "a priori" atrophy subtypes, highlighting the clinical usefulness of MRI-based subtype stratification.
However, these hypothesis-driven studies were per design limited to prior definitions of neuropathological subtypes and cannot provide any information on whether these patterns represent a comprehensive description of the atrophy subtypes that are present in the larger population of patients.
On the other hand, more novel data-driven neuroimaging investigations consistently revealed subtypes characterized by atrophy patterns that visually resembled the predefined neuropathological subtypes (Fig.
The most common way of subtyping AD neuroimaging patterns in a data-driven manner is using unsupervised clustering approaches on regional neuroimaging features
Clustering, in this context, aims to find subgroups of patients with similar spatial patterns of neuroimaging abnormalities.
From a methodological perspective, approaches mainly differ with respect to (i) clustering techniques, (ii) validation methods, and (iii) features used for clustering.
One of the first of these data-driven studies used Ward's clustering of cortical thickness features to categorize mild AD into distinct atrophy subtypes, including medial temporal-dominant (34%), parietal-dominant (18%), and diffuse atrophy (48%)
Later investigations showed that regional hypometabolism on FDG-PET could further dissociate those subtypes
Replication of results within an independent sample is indeed crucial to demonstrate that the identified subtypes reflect a true characteristic of the disease, rather than corresponding to a specific variation observed within a single sample.
However, one limitation of the approaches employed in
This issue can be addressed using clustering techniques that allow patients to be associated with multiple subtypes to varying degrees.
For example, non-negative matrix factorization, as applied to voxel-wise gray matter volumes in
This model simultaneously learns "loadings" (assignments) of patients to these atrophy patterns as well, allowing patients to be assigned to multiple patterns.
Interestingly, the study found four AD atrophy subtypes and reproduced them across three different datasets (one discovery, and two validation datasets).
Despite the reproducibility of those subtypes, other studies have identified even five distinct atrophy subtypes
Unsupervised random forest-based clustering applied on regional gray matter volumes in two independent AD cohorts found two distinct "typical" subtypes (~70%), as well as three different atypical subtypes (~30%) termed "limbic predominant", "minimal atrophy", and "hippocampal sparing"
Notably, the distinct minimal atrophy subtype had also been reported in hypothesis-driven studies
An alternative approach to model a one-to-many mapping between patients and disease subtypes is to use probabilistic models that assign patients to subtypes in a probabilistic (soft) fashion.
Such a model was employed in
The method does not explicitly cluster patients into subtypes, but instead identifies distinct atrophy factors corresponding to latent subtypes, and patients are probabilistically assigned to these subtypes.
The study confirmed the reported temporal and neocortical atrophy subtypes, but also found a more unusual subcortical atrophy subtype covering striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum.
Indeed, most patients, both in
While being biologically plausible, this may also relate to the general limitation of clustering methods to not properly disentangle heterogeneity caused by disease stage and disease subtype.
Thus, one potential issue with subtype analysis, in general, is that the variance captured by putative subtypes may correspond to different disease stages rather than different disease expression patterns (subtypes), or a mixture of both.
This limitation was explicitly addressed in(41) using a computational technique that combines clustering and disease progression modelling to group patients with common phenotypes across the range of disease stages.
Like the approaches in
While this emphasizes the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in disease stage, it must be noted that the method only infers the stage information from cross-sectional data.
Including actual longitudinal neuroimaging data into the clustering methods is a promising approach that remains to be explored in more detail
A potentially bigger issue in identifying subtypes using unsupervised clustering approaches is that subtypes are not even guaranteed to relate directly to the disease.
That is, beyond capturing variance of different stages or expression patterns, some clusters may also be related to different age groups, sex, or any other unaccounted confounding variables, unless samples are carefully designed to mitigate the effects of such variables.
One possible solution is to harness power of clustering and supervised learning techniques (e.g., classification, regression) together.
An example solution to address common confounding effects (e.g., age, sex) in the identification of distinct disease paths differentiating patients from healthy controls was proposed in
The application of this method to the ADNI data-set showed a minimal atrophy subtype (13%), a subtype with distributed atrophy (28%), and two subtypes with prominent medial temporal lobe involvement resembling purer AD pathology (59%)
One disadvantage of the technique is its high computational demand when applied to high dimensional data (e.g.
voxel-wise maps).
While the large majority of data-driven neuroimaging studies on AD subtyping and related methodological development has focused on neurodegeneration patterns in structural MRI data, these methods are now also beginning to be used for exploring heterogeneity in neuropathological patterns evidenced by other MRI and PET-imaging modalities ((44-48); Table
Initial exploration of clustering in tau-PET imaging supported the broad differential subtypes of medial temporal-vs.
neocortical-predominant tau distribution invivo(47).
However, data-driven explorations of detailed tau-PET patterns are still limited by low sample sizes of well-defined patient populations examined using this novel imaging technique.

Data-driven subtyping studies using other phenotyping modalities
In addition to data-driven neuroimaging studies, considerable heterogeneity among AD dementia patients has also been revealed by applying clustering methods to comprehensive neuropsychological test data (reviewed in
Across different studies, clustering approaches have identified two broad cognitive subtypes of AD dementia patients, corresponding to those with a typical memory-impaired cognitive profile and those with relatively spared memory compared to non-memory domains
However, at a higher clustering resolution more detailed cognitive subtypes could also be revealed depending on the relative degree of memory impairment and the specific non-memory domains that were most affected
According to a recent neuropsychological profiling study in late-onset AD dementia patients, the majority (48%) had a relatively homogeneous impairment across memory and other cognitive domains, whereas smaller subsets of patients had isolated relative impairments in memory (18%), visuospatial functioning (14%), language (9%), or executive functioning (8%)
Other data-driven subtyping studies using dimensional clustering of CSF biomarker data in clinically diagnosed AD dementia
These included a relatively small subgroup with extremely high levels of tau pathology (including both phosphorylated and total tau) that showed a more aggressive disease course over time, and a distinct subgroup with clearly abnormal amyloid levels but relatively low levels of both tau markers, which did not differ in global disease severity from the other clusters.
The degree to which the subtyping findings derived from different phenotyping modalities correspond to overlapping patient subgroups is currently not clear.
Based on overlapping cognitive and neuroimaging characteristics reported across the different subtyping studies
Similarly, the distinct CSF subgroups with extremely high and low tau levels may also potentially map onto this broad distinction between memory/medial temporal-dominant and non-memory/cortical-dominant presentations, respectively, given that these have also been linked to corresponding differences in overall tau levels and pace of cognitive decline
However, due to the current lack of cross-modal subtyping studies the actual correspondence between the different reported subtypes remains unknown, and there are obvious differences in the subtyping granularities reported for the different modalities and even across individual studies for a given modality.
Only a concurrent subtype classification of the same patient sample, which applies analogous clustering approaches to the different modalities, will allow assessing to which degree the different modality-specific subtypes map to overlapping patient subgroups.

Possible mechanisms underlying heterogeneity
Relatively little is known about the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie the development of distinct atrophy patterns and clinical presentations in the face of common core pathologic features of AD.
Recently, spatially comprehensive analyses of brain-wide regional gene expression profiles in the human brain have indicated that the typical regional patterns of AD pathology accumulation might be explained by specific molecular characteristics of the affected brain regions
However, gene expression profiles associated with the pathologic distribution patterns characterizing atypical AD subtypes have not yet been investigated.
With respect to subject-specific risk factors, the APOE4 genotype has consistently been found to be more strongly associated with a typical memorypredominant presentation and related atrophy profile than with any other AD subtype
Recent exploratory genetic studies could also provide initial evidence for genetic factors that may be specifically associated with other cognitively defined subtypes of AD
Intriguingly, specific neurodevelopmental learning disabilities have been linked to atypical clinical variants of AD, raising the possibility that developmental disturbances might render the implicated neurofunctional networks more vulnerable to AD-related neurodegeneration in these patients
It remains to be determined whether specific neurodevelopmental characteristics may also bias to any of the data-driven neurodegeneration subtypes described above.
Several other age-related pathologies that are often comorbid with AD are well-known to influence the regional neurodegeneration pattern and clinical phenotype of the disease
However, limited data exists on the relation between comorbid pathologies and specific AD subtypes.
For example, comorbid TDP-43 and cerebrovascular disease appear both to be considerably more frequent in limbic-predominant and typical neuropathologic subtypes of AD compared to the hippocampal-sparing subtype
Post-mortem neuropathologic characteristics of neuroimaging-defined AD atrophy subtypes have not yet been studied.
However, several of these neuroimaging studies reported a higher cerebrovascular burden, as measured by white matter hyperintensities (WMH), in medial temporal-predominant subtypes
Investigations of further MRI markers of small vessel disease concluded that limbic-predominant and typical AD atrophy subtypes may indeed more often present with hypertensive arteriopathy, whereas hippocampal-sparing and minimal atrophy AD subtypes may have a higher prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Interestingly, a data-driven structural covariance analysis of WMH in a large community-based sample identified distinct regional distribution patterns of WMH that also showed differential relations to age, polygenic AD risk, and cortical atrophy
Together this data points to differential age-and disease-dependent pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the appearance of regionally specific vascular lesions and related cortical atrophy patterns, which may intersect in patients with comorbid AD and cerebrovascular disease.

Mild cognitive impairment
MCI is a clinical syndrome defined by impairment of cognitive function, often amnestic, but without sufficient functional impairment required for a diagnosis of dementia.
While the condition often represents prodromal AD, patients may also progress to other dementia types, remain stable, or even revert to normal cognition
From a neuropathologic point of view, it has been reported that less than 25% of MCI patients have pure AD pathology.
On the other hand, mixed pathologies were most common, and another 20-30% had primarily non-AD pathologies, including cerebrovascular disease and other age-related pathologies primarily targeting the medial temporal lobe
Recent data-driven studies on AD atrophy subtypes have demonstrated that the identified patterns can already be detected in prodromal disease stages as represented by amyloidpositive MCI patients
However, only few studies have employed data-driven clustering approaches to explore heterogeneous neuroimaging patterns in unselected MCI cohorts, which potentially also encompass non-AD related atrophy subtypes ((80-82); Table
One study applied an established graph-theory-based clustering approach to cortical thickness features from structural MRI scans of a large monocentric memory clinic cohort of amnestic MCI patients
The analysis identified one cluster without any evidence of neurodegeneration (39%), as well as two different "medial-temporal" (31%) and "parietotemporal" (30%) cortical atrophy patterns that resembled the AD atrophy subtypes captured with the same method
However, only the parieto-temporal subtype had increased amyloid-PET positivity, APOE4 prevalence, and risk of AD dementia conversion, suggesting that the medial temporal subtype also contained a high proportion of non-AD pathophysiology accounting for this atrophy pattern.
Biologically distinct MCI subgroups have also been studied using clustering applied to diverse multimodal CSF and neuroimaging-derived features
For example, one study applied Ward's clustering to such data of amnestic MCI patients from the ADNI cohort.
Similar to the subtyping based on regional atrophy patterns
Furthermore, a fourth cluster (37%) showed severe medial temporal atrophy, together with low tau levels, only slightly abnormal amyloid load, and high WMH burden, corroborating the common contribution of non-AD pathophysiology to medial temporal degeneration in amnestic MCI patients

Frontotemporal degeneration
FTD refers to a spectrum of clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneous disorders.
From a clinical perspective, FTD is comprised of two predominant presentations, including the behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD), characterized by progressive social and executive dysfunction, and the primary progressive aphasias (PPA), which encompass recognized semantic, nonfluent-agrammatic, and logopenic variants.
To date, only a handful of neuroimaging studies have aimed to characterize the neurodegenerative heterogeneity among these broad clinical FTD syndromes in a datadriven manner((41,86-91); Table
A first study in bvFTD used Ward's clustering of regional gray matter volumes from structural MRI and identified a total of four distinct atrophy subtypes, of which two were characterized by predominant temporal lobe atrophy ('temporal-dominant' (9%) and 'temporofrontoparietal' (41%)), and the other two by predominant frontal lobe atrophy ('frontal-dominant' (32%) and frontotemporal' (18%)
This broad distinction into temporal-predominant and frontal-predominant atrophy subtypes of bvFTD could later be reproduced in independent clustering studies using measures of regional network degeneration on MRI
Clustering of regional FDG-PET measurements was also used in a data-driven neuroimaging study of a clinically diverse sample of PPA patients.
Here, the identified hypometabolic patterns separated the three canonical PPA variants, but suggested a further splitting of the non-fluent and logopenic variants into two subtypes each
Finally, application of an algorithm combining clustering and disease progression modelling on structural MRI data from a large cohort of familial FTD patients identified four distinct spatiotemporal patterns of atrophy progression, and these had a high correspondence with the main genetic subgroups (GRN, C9orf72, MAPT)
Moreover, early stages of the distinct atrophy subtypes could already be detected in presymptomatic mutation carriers, highlighting the potential of this approach for early detection and classification of neurodegeneration subtypes at presymptomatic disease stages of FTD.

Lewy body dementias
LBD, including Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is characterized by a distinct dementia syndrome with predominant attention, executive, and visuospatial impairments, which may fluctuate over time and are typically accompanied by distinct neuropsychiatric symptoms
A typical neuroimaging pattern of LBD has been described that involves predominant posterior cortical neurodegeneration with notable occipital involvement and relative sparing of the medial temporal lobe
However, like other broadly-defined dementia categories, individual clinical presentations within this characteristic LBD syndrome are heterogeneous (96-100).
Several neuroimaging studies could demonstrate that inter-individual differences in the core symptom dimensions of LBD associate with regionally-specific neurodegeneration as measured by structural MRI or FDG-PET (101-103).
While individual atrophy patterns of DLB patients were recently also shown to associate differentially with specific predefined AD atrophy subtypes (105), we only identified a single data-driven neuroimaging study on neurodegeneration subtypes in LBD.
The study applied Ward's clustering on regional FDG-PET measurements in a sample of DLB patients and described two clusters that were only differentiated by slightly different occipital hypometabolism (104).
The cluster with more severe occipital involvement (43%) had worse global cognition and higher risk for developing visual hallucinations over clinical follow-up.
While this suggests that hypometabolic patterns may be relatively homogeneous among DLB patients, one has to note that the sample size was rather small for a data-driven exploration While to our knowledge no data-driven neuroimaging studies have yet been conducted to explore regional neurodegeneration subtypes in PDD, data-driven studies applying Ward's clustering to MRI-derived cortical thickness features have described heterogeneous atrophy patterns among nondemented PD patients(106-108).
It remains to be determined whether the distinct cortical atrophy patterns in these patients show pattern-specific associations with progression to PDD or may represent early forms of distinct PDD subtypes.

Advantages, drawbacks and future directions
The recent advances in neuroimaging and machine learning offer sophisticated approaches to characterizing heterogeneity in ADRD.
Through facilitating the discovery of different neurodegeneration subtypes, these approaches can capture granular individual differences that are mostly obscured in traditional group-level analyses.
This discovery is highly critical to elucidate biological mechanisms that need to be understood for the development of drugs that are specifically tailored for specific disease variants or even for individuals.
On the other hand, the results of such novel approaches must be interpreted carefully (for a recent review on limitations of data-driven subtyping(109)).
First, due to lack of ground truth labels, the use of clustering techniques for subtype discovery needs external validation steps using independent data modalities and cohorts, to ensure that the discovered subtypes reflect reproducible and biologically meaningful entities.
Second, from a methodological perspective, methods to disentangle heterogeneity may also have stability issues, since results may change with slight changes in input features or model parameters.
Thus, assessment of the stability of results, through subsampling, out-of-sample replication, and parameter perturbations, should be a part of the standard use(110-112).
In the case of AD dementia data-driven studies across multiple independent cohorts could provide converging evidence for the existence of at least three distinct atrophy subtypes that broadly resemble the neocortical vs medial temporal patterns characterizing the neuropathologically-defined subtypes (Fig.
However, at a more granular level the findings of more detailed subtypes characterized by differentiated cortical atrophy patterns are more variable across the existing studies.
Consensus-based summaries or repositories of the voxelwise maps characterizing the different subtypes reported across data-driven studies would allow coordinate-based meta-analyses to reveal the most robust subtype-defining spatial patterns(113-115).
In this context, more standardization of protocols across prospective cohort studies would be an important future step to reduce variance in subject recruitments and phenotyping variables, thus facilitating replication and synthesis between studies.
Moreover, the computational subtyping approaches also critically depend on the overall quality of the phenotyping variables used to describe the individual patients, and increasing the sensitivity and specificity of these variables to the underlying disease process may represent an important venue for future research to move the field forward.
Furthermore, longitudinal neuroimaging assessments, while not yet well explored in subtyping studies, may be better suited for deciphering disease subtypes based on actual neurodegeneration trajectories instead of cross-sectional measures
In addition, most of the neuroimagingbased subtyping work so far has focused on anatomical MRI data, which may be less sensitive to early neurodegenerative processes compared to microstructural or functional imaging modalities.
While these latter modalities are also beginning to be used for studying neurodegenerative heterogeneity in ADRD
Finally, current subtyping approaches typically make use of either relatively simplistic metrics from multiple biomarker modalities (e.g., hippocampal volume and CSF biomarker status)
More systematic cross-modal subtyping comparisons and the direct combination of high-dimensional information from multiple modalities
Such a comprehensive multimodal definition will strongly benefit from the increasing availability of large-scale standardized datasets from wellphenotyped patient cohorts in combination with current advances in methods and power for computational analytics.
Resemblance between gray matter loss associated with the neuropathological subtypes of differentially distributed neurofibrillary tangles
Often these approaches made use of either simplistic metrics from multiple modalities or high-dimensional data from one single modality.
As more phenotypic information is being collected within largescale observational cohort studies together with improvements in computational power and algorithmic solutions, future work will incorporate combination of high-dimensional information from multiple modalities (i.e., clinical, pathological, and imaging) that may achieve a more comprehensive definition of distinct disease subtypes in AD and related dementia.
Towards that standardization in data acquisition and harmonization between various cohorts is key element for future success for such frameworks implementing data synthesis across the different domains.
