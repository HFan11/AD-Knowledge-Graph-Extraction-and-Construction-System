Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Its Treatment in Aging: Effects on Alzheimer’s disease Biomarkers, Cognition, Brain Structure and Neurophysiology
Here we review the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, neuroanatomy, cognition and neurophysiology, and present the research investigating the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.
OSA is associated with an increase in AD markers amyloid-β and tau measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in blood serum.
There is some evidence suggesting CPAP therapy normalizes AD biomarkers in CSF but since mechanisms for amyloid-β and tau production/clearance in humans are not completely understood, these findings remain preliminary.
Deficits in the cognitive domains of attention, vigilance, memory and executive functioning are observed in OSA patients with the magnitude of impairment appearing stronger in younger people from clinical settings than in older community samples.
Cognition improves with varying degrees after CPAP use, with the greatest effect seen for attention in middle age adults with more severe OSA and sleepiness.
Paradigms in which encoding and retrieval of information are separated by periods of sleep with or without OSA have been done only rarely, but perhaps offer a better chance to understand cognitive effects of OSA than isolated daytime testing.
In cognitively normal individuals, changes in EEG microstructure during sleep, particularly slow oscillations and spindles, are associated with biomarkers of AD, and measures of cognition and memory.
Similar changes in EEG activity are reported in AD and OSA, such as "EEG slowing" during wake and REM sleep, and a degradation of NREM EEG microstructure.
There is evidence that CPAP therapy partially reverses these changes but large longitudinal studies demonstrating this are lacking.
A diagnostic definition of OSA relying solely on the Apnea Hypopnea Index

Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a type of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) (ICSD-3 2014) characterized by recurrent complete or partial closure of the upper airway followed by blood oxygen desaturation and/or arousal from sleep.
Untreated, these repetitive respiratory events can lead to fragmented, disrupted sleep and chronic nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, reoxygenation, and hypercapnia or hypocapnia.
OSA diagnosis is made using assessment of physiological signals from oronasal airflow, respiratory effort and pulse oximetry during sleep.
Polysomnography (PSG), including EEG, is considered the gold standard for investigation of suspected SDB, however recordings with only airflow and/or pulse oximetry are commonly used for diagnosis
OSA severity is predominantly classified with reference to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), defined as the number of respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) per hour of sleep.
Critically, there are multiple definitions of "hypopnea," leading to multiple AHI's, and no one definition of AHI is used consistently in clinical research investigating OSA and its effect on health outcomes.
A review of eleven population-based epidemiological studies from around the world between 1993 and 2013 found an average prevalence rate of 22% in men and 17% in women for at least mild OSA, and 6% in men and 4% in women for the OSA syndrome (OSAS), also known as OSA with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)
One of the more recent large studies of community-recruited individuals, the HypnoLaus study, used the AASM 2012 hypopnea definition ≥30% drop of airflow lasting at least 10 s with either an arousal or ≥3% oxygen desaturation (AHI3A).
In this study, when subjects were dichotomized by age (ages 40-60 years and ages 60-85 years), the proportion of subjects with AHI3A ≥ 15/hour was 26.8% in the younger group (39.6% in men, 13.9% in women) and 48.7% in the older group
Treatment options for OSA include positive airway pressure devices, oral appliances, behavioral/ lifestyle modification, surgery and/or a combination of approaches.
Deciding on the most effective treatment for an individual diagnosed with sleep OSA depends on disease severity, presenting symptoms and contributing causes.
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most commonly prescribed treatment and works by the delivery of positive pressure via a mask worn over the nose (and/or mouth), functioning to splint the upper airway open during sleep
Over the last few years, the literature has expanded regarding the links between sleep disruption, markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the development of cognitive impairment and/or dementia.
A recent meta-analysis showed SDB was a risk factor of all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia

OSA impacts markers associated with increasing AD risk Amyloid/tau biomarkers
There is mounting evidence that OSA is associated with an increase in markers associated with AD, specifically amyloid-β and tau measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in blood serum.
In several studies where OSA was diagnosed using PSG, reduced CSF amyloid-β levels compared to age-matched controls without OSA have been demonstrated
When groups were stratified by ApoE allele status, OSA severity positively correlated with amyloid-β 42 , phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and total tau (T-tau) in ApoE3 carriers and negatively correlated with amyloid-β 42 levels in those with ApoE2
Interpreting AD risk based solely on CSF amyloid-β in cognitively normal older individuals at cross section is not straightforward.
While there is consensus that CSF amyloid-β is lower in individuals with bona fide AD dementia versus age matched controls, there is evidence for elevated CSF amyloid-β with a steeper subsequent decline in individuals with genetic risk for AD
Additionally, an analysis of interrelationships between CSF amyloid-β and tau across a wide variety of ages showed that there was an overall positive correlation between CSF amyloid-β and tau between the ages of 45 and 70, whereas there was an overall negative correlation between CSF amyloid-β and tau between the ages of 71 and 90 (de
PET amyloid tracer uptake levels are a robust predictor of amyloid burden as well as of future development of AD
The first PET study to show greater amyloid deposition with increasing OSA severity was a small pilot study of 5 people with MCI
However, the association between amyloid and OSA was not observed among the 8 cognitively normal participants.
A more recent analysis in 14 OSAS patients with normal cognition also found no association between SDB and amyloid uptake
In contrast, a case control study of 19 participants with SDB found higher amyloid deposition in the right posterior cingulate gyrus and right temporal cortex compared to controls
Also, a cross sectional study of 117 cognitively normal Australian veterans (42 with OSA diagnosed by PSG) showed cortical uptake of 18F-florbetaben (ligand binding to amyloid aggregates) was higher in OSA group than in those without symptoms of OSA.
In this study, a regression analysis revealed the relationship between amyloid deposition and OSA was independent of age and vascular risk factors, but not BMI or ApoE4 status, where the presence of ApoE4 amyloid burden was increased to a greater degree in those with OSA
Another cross-sectional analysis found 96 of 127 community dwelling, cognitively normal individuals with OSA showed greater amyloid burden via PET in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus areas which overlapped with increased grey matter volumes, perfusion and glucose metabolism
Tau has been less studied overall with relation to OSA.
Individuals with OSA have been shown to have elevated plasma concentrations of T-tau
Although there is poor correlation between serum and CSF tau concentrations, serum tau may nonetheless be useful as a predictive marker for dementia
Relatedly, individuals with OSA were shown to have elevated concentrations of T-tau/Aβ42 in the CSF in comparison to either individuals without OSA or with PAP-treated OSA
Tau PET imaging was employed in a cross-sectional analysis of 292 cognitively unimpaired adults who, when their bed-partners positively reported "witnessed apnea," had more elevated tau-PET levels in the entorhinal cortex and inferior temporal cortex
Longitudinal studies are therefore useful in clarifying some of the cross-sectional inconsistencies.
Our group has reported two longitudinal studies using both CSF and PET imaging markers of Alzheimer's disease in OSA.

Changes in markers of disease with CPAP treatment
There is a paucity of literature demonstrating CPAP treatment effects on amyloid and tau biomarkers of AD.
In the only study to examine a CPAP treatment effect that incorporated in-lab PSG, CSF sampling and neurocognitive testing,
Untreated OSA patients showed lower CSF amyloid-β 42 concentrations, and higher T-tau/ amyloid-β 42 ratio compared to both CPAP-treated individuals and controls.
Furthermore, lower CSF amyloid-β 42 levels correlated with lower average nocturnal oxygen saturation and cognition in OSA patients.
In contrast, an Cross-sectional studies investigating middle age and older adults with OSA have demonstrated cognitive impairments in executive function
In contrast other groups have found no significant association between OSA and measures of executive function, attention or memory
Proposed explanatory mechanisms for findings relating OSA to cognitive impairment include daytime sleepiness from sleep fragmentation and/or neurovascular damage as a result of intermittent hypoxia, although the contributions of each are not well established
Indeed, some of the aforementioned studies find the severity of disease corresponds to degree of cognitive impairment, though invariably it depends on not only on the measure investigated but the method of measurement of both OSA and cognition
Some earlier research suggests the degree of sleep fragmentation results in deficits of attention and memory
In a large study of 743 people undergoing a clinical PSG study who had an AHI ≥ 5 and completed a pre-sleep PVT assessment,
However, there have been no recent or sufficiently large studies corroborating such delineations with memory or executive function.
A complicating factor in the assessment of cognitive outcomes in people with OSA is the issue of sleepiness which is purported to worsen cognitive performance
A review of the literature

Overnight memory
Most studies investigating cognitive function in OSA assess general cognitive abilities during daytime neuropsychological test batteries or neurobehavioral vigilance rather than sleep related memory processing which involves encoding and recall separated by a period of sleep
In the small number of studies incorporating overnight memory assessments in OSA patients, there is demonstrated impairment in processing of declarative and procedural memory tasks compared to healthy controls
In a series of studies showing impaired overnight motor sequence task learning in moderately severe OSA, a negative relationship was observed between task performance and a polysomnographic (PSG) arousal index
CPAP withdrawal is a way to observe the deleterious effect of OSA on overnight memory task.
A study by our group found the benefits of overnight sleep for improvements on a spatial navigation task are attenuated when OSA is induced by selective CPAP withdrawal during REM sleep

Changes in cognition with CPAP treatment
CPAP treatment results in variable changes to cognition
In the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date, 6 months of CPAP treatment was associated with transient improvements (at 2 months only) in attention and executive functioning, with greater effects on a sustained working memory task at 6 months in those with higher baseline daytime sleepiness (ESS > 10)
A summary of the existing RCTs shows both short and long-term CPAP treatment improves some of the deficits associated with OSA in middle-aged adults
Alternatively,
In older adults, similar observations are made with large multi-center trials
However, a lack of treatment related outcomes could be explained by low CPAP adherence levels at least in the study by
In smaller, single center trials, improvements in attention, psychomotor speed, memory and executive function are observed particularly in those with higher CPAP usage
In an observational study of moderate-severe OSA,
Moreover, whilst a greater number of patients showed a normalization of sleepiness and neurobehavioral function with longer nightly durations of CPAP, a substantial number did not.
In a large cross-sectional study, patients with mild-moderate OSA,
Studies investigating OSA treatment and overnight memory consolidation find longer-term use, but not a single night of CPAP therapy, augment offline sleep-mediated motor memory consolidation
By looking at age of onset of MCI in subjects with self-reported OSA and use of CPAP for treatment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we observed that cognitively normal older individuals with self-reported untreated OSA had an average age of onset of MCI that was 11 years earlier than those subjects without OSA (72 year vs 83 years), while those individuals with self-reported CPAP treatment had an average age of MCI onset that was similar to those without OSA at all (82 years)

Treatment in MCI/AD with OSA
There is some evidence that CPAP treatment in those already suffering from cognitive impairments can improve symptoms or delay further cognitive decline.
A pilot study investigating rate of cognitive decline in patients with moderate AD and severe OSA found CPAP-treated individuals had a significantly slower cognitive decline (Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score changes) compared to untreated individuals over three years
A recent quasi-experimental study investigating MCI and OSA found significant improvements in psychomotor/cognitive processing speed in CPAP adherent patients after 1 year compared to a non-adherent control group
They also observed improvements in memory, sleepiness and daily functioning suggesting CPAP may slow the progression of dementia.

Summary
Overall, more consistent findings of cognitive impairment are seen in young and middleaged patients with OSA rather than in elderly community dwelling cohorts with findings likely driven by treatment-seeking individuals
CPAP may be effective in improving cognition, particularly in the presence of sleepiness and given good treatment adherence.
CPAP treatment also shows promise for delaying further cognitive decline in those with MCI and AD, but more cognitive assessments where encoding and recall are separated by a period of sleep are needed to understand OSA-related impaired cognition within individuals.

Neuroanatomical changes in OSA
OSA is clinically characterized by intermittent hypoxia and chronic sleep fragmentation, and both are proposed to alter normal brain morphology.
OSA-related hypoxemia has been thought to be associated with an increase in sympathetic vasoconstriction and a concurrent decrease in vascular protective mechanisms thereby leading to changes in structure and function of blood vessels
In addition, effects of OSA-related sleep fragmentation on brain structure and function can be inferred from studies on chronic and acute sleep deprivation.
It has been suggested that sleep loss, either independently or as part of a comorbid condition such as OSA or other neurological disorders, is associated with increased atrophy within the frontal, temporal and parietal regions
While delineating the relative contribution of intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation to the neuroanatomical changes seen in OSA is challenging, neuroimaging tools can nevertheless provide a global picture of abnormal brain structure in OSA patients.
A growing body of studies utilizing neuroimaging tools have identified neuroanatomical abnormalities that coexist with OSA.
Using voxel based morphometry (VBM), several studies identified gray matter (GM) density reduction in frontal, parietal, temporal, and hippocampal regions in patients with OSA
In these studies, the hippocampus and fronto-parietal cortices are noted to be the most sensitive to GM loss in OSA
Care must be taken however, when interpreting observed changes in gray matter volume based on T1-weighted MR measurements.
It has been observed that myelin or iron content rather than neurodegeneration
As a result, it is likely that these GM changes are explained in part due to the tissue's physical properties rather than neuronal loss.
Either acquisition methods that go beyond T1-weighted imaging or analyses methods that supplement the T1-weighted imaging modality would help to better assess gray matter changes in OSA.
In addition to GM, white matter (WM) abnormalities are also seen in patients with OSA.
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies revealed WM lesions in OSA to be more pronounced in the cortices, limbic system, pons and cerebellum tracts
Fractional anisotropy (FA) measures are routinely measured in DTI studies.
The FA values measure directionality of water movement in brain tissue and can be used to infer the integrity of brain tissue.
Using this technique, a recent study revealed a loss of WM integrity and structural connectivity in a largely mildmoderate OSA population
Of note, at least some studies have suggested OSA might be associated with gray matter hypertrophy, rather than atrophy
In addition to MRI and DTI studies, other modalities of neuroimaging have also been used to study the neuroanatomical changes seen in OSA.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been widely used to non-invasively study biochemical changes in brain.
MRS studies in OSA suggest metabolite profiles in the hippocampus
Other observations include significantly decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker or neuronal injury, and increased levels of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in limbic regions including the hippocampus, thalamus, putamen and midbrain

Changes in brain structure with CPAP treatment
In moderate to severe OSA,
These changes corresponded to improvement in attentional regulation and working memory capacity compared to a 'wait list' control condition (patients randomly allocated to group, stratified for OSA severity, age and level of education).
Treatment of OSA with CPAP is known to improve intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation.
As such it is plausible to hypothesize that CPAP treatment would also result in neuroanatomical changes that may reach levels seen in non-OSA subjects.
On the other hand, O'
Notably, they also did not observe any changes in GM density or volumes at baseline, i.e., before treatment when compared to healthy controls.
Subsequent commentaries reveal that the source of the discrepancies between results of the study by
However, average nightly CPAP use is equally likely to be the source of the discrepancies between the results of these studies.
In addition to GM volume changes seen with CPAP treatment, normalization of WM changes seen in OSA has also been reported.
They reported a normalization of WM fiber integrity using DTI based FA measures after 12 months, with the 3-month follow up showing only limited changes.
This study and those by others highlight another important aspect that is often observed in OSA studies looking at treatment effects, i.e. 3 months of CPAP treatment may not be enough to reverse presumed adverse effects of OSA.
Using dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging (a subtype of DTI),
The FA and mean diffusivity changes imply improvements in the brain's microstructural integrity.
Moreover, CPAP treatment was observed to improve brain perfusion measured by quantifying cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume.

Summary
Advances in neuroimaging have enabled observation of significant neuroanatomical changes in OSA patients.
Notably, these changes parallel those seen in healthy aging
Whether the progression of these neuroanatomical changes in healthy elderly is accelerated in presence of OSA or other comorbid neurological disorders remains to be tested.
CPAP treatment is shown to induce neuroanatomical changes in treatment naïve OSA patients with indication of a presumed cumulative benefit from long-term CPAP use.
However, several questions remain to be addressed given that there are various sources of variability that could influence the results namely methodology, severity and chronicity of disease, as well as nightly CPAP adherence.

Sleep disruption and markers of AD
Sleep disruption can be described in many ways including poor-quality, short duration and/or fragmented sleep.
Varied approaches to sleep measurement, such as subjective reporting via questionnaires
EEG is a powerful tool to investigate intra-individual stability and inter-individual variation in sleep/wake biology and behavior
Scalp EEG is a low cost, non-invasive measure of brain activity with high temporal resolution widely used in diverse settings to determine sleep/wake state, diagnose disease and assess response to treatment

EEG measures as correlates of AD
Quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) measures during wakefulness in AD show a slowing of the dominant occipital rhythms compared to age-matched controls
Specifically, EEG theta activity during wakefulness has been observed to correlate positively with CSF T-tau, P-tau and cognitive decline
Some researchers suggest that EEG measures during sleep, particularly REM sleep, are more sensitive than wake measures in detecting EEG slowing indicative of progressing dementia
One explanation offered is that the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, known to degenerate early in AD, are more active during REM than during wake
During PSG analysis, EEG components are visually inspected to determine sleep architecture measures in terms of sleep macrostructure, i.e. duration of non-REM stages N1, N2 and N3 (Slow Wave Sleep), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wake.
Sleep EEG microstructure refers to the background rhythms and transient events that comprise the EEG signal.
Slow waves (SWs), K-complexes (KCs) and sleep spindles are key EEG microstructure events used in visual sleep scoring to define and differentiate the three stages of NREM sleep.
EEG microstructure oscillations can be automatically quantified using spectral and/or event-based analysis techniques and provide a more nuanced understanding of sleep neurophysiology (Younes 2017).
SWs and slow wave activity (SWA) are in the frequency range of ~0.3 to 4 Hz and encapsulate both slow oscillations (SOs) of < 1 Hz and delta band activity between ~1-4 Hz
It may be important to functionally differentiate slow oscillations from delta activity as they have been shown to have differing impacts on both memory (in rodents)
Slow wave sleep (SWS) and SWA during NREM sleep are putative markers of sleep homeostasis
High-density EEG and neuroimaging studies investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of the slow oscillation find each wave originates at a definite (mostly prefrontal) site and travels in an anteroposterior direction across the scalp
Slow oscillations, and associated cortical neuronal activities, cycle between depolarization (active state of intense firing) and hyperpolarization (silent state), and are thought to group or coordinate other NREM oscillations such as delta waves and spindles
In cognitively normal individuals, EEG microstructure changes during sleep are associated with biomarkers of AD and measures of cognition and memory.
NREM SWA has been shown to negatively correlate with CSF amyloid-β levels
Moverover, impairments in declarative
Sleep spindles are defined as waxing-and-waning oscillations of sigma frequency (~11-16 Hz) activity lasting around 0.5-3 seconds
Along with SOs and K-complexes they are also involved in cortical activity related to arousal stimuli
Using intra-cranial EEG and single unit neuronal recordings during preoperative localization of epileptic foci in humans,
Fast spindles dominated centro-parietal regions, while slow spindles dominated frontal areas during SWS.
Neuroimaging, pharmacological and memory studies also support the existence of two topographically and functionally distinct spindles
Furthermore, spindle frequency activity (SFA) is reduced in middle-aged and older adults, relative to younger adults
This age-related reduction in SFA is related to impairments in the number of sleep spindles generated (density per unit time) and other morphological features such as amplitude and duration.
Spindle density shows more marked reductions frontally with age
Evidence of sexual dimorphism in spindle activity is widely reported with females showing higher sleep spindle densities compared to men
There is evidence from scalp EEG that fast spindles are synchronized to the depolarizing SO up-state and slow spindles to the transition towards the down-state
A recent study demonstrates less slow oscillation-spindle coupling to be associated with greater temporal lobe tau burden but not with amyloid-β burden, which was independently associated with < 1 Hz SWA
This is interesting in the context of recent work from our group showing fast spindle density and duration are inversely related to T-tau levels.
In this work, spindle activity from a central EEG derivation was negatively correlated with both CSF measures of amyloid-β and tau, and with cognition
Inventive applications of quantitative EEG analysis methodologies are being used to interpret sleep EEG changes in the context of brain health.
For example,
EEG features characteristic of non-REM sleep are seen to degrade with progressing MCI/AD beyond that of normal aging.
Spontaneous K-complexes
Furthermore, a study using auditory evoked K-complexes during sleep showed a decreased density and amplitude in AD, whilst greater dementia severity was associated with a lower probability of eliciting a K-complex
A recent study demonstrated age-related cognitive impairment was related to a reduction in delta, theta and sigma power during NREM sleep in patients with subjective cognitive complaints or MCI (N=29) compared to controls (N=29).
One-year follow-up of these patients showed changes in spindle characteristics (amplitude, duration, density or frequency) to be associated most strongly with cognitive decline
In contrast, a larger analysis of older women found those who developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia (N=85) after 5 years had increased theta and sigma EEG power density during both REM and NREM sleep at baseline compared to those women who did not deteriorate (N=85)
Possible reasons for the differing direction of findings relating to theta and sigma frequencies in these two studies include the differences between groups regarding medication usage and inclusion of males and females in the Taillard et al. (
It is worth noting that in the study by
Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) analysis is a useful way to quantify EEG arousal and sleep instability phenomena.
Briefly, the analysis identifies alternating sequences of cortical activation (phase A) followed by periods of deactivation (phase B).
The phase A subtype A1-A3 events are described according to the proportion of event duration dominated by either high-voltage slow waves (EEG synchrony) or low-amplitude fast rhythms (EEG desynchrony) and include characteristic sleep EEG oscillations and transient events
CAP phases subtype A1 often contain SWs, Kcomplexes and spindles, and subtypes A2 and A3 are akin to AASM defined microarousal events
Using CAP analysis,

EEG in OSA, correlates of AD markers?
Changes in EEG activity are reported in OSA during both wake and sleep states, and are reviewed comprehensively in D'
In a similar way to findings reported in those with cognitive decline, EEG slowing during wakefulness is observed in OSA compared to controls
Furthermore, increased EEG slowing is related to worse daytime symptoms, such as sleepiness
Whilst some investigations have found EEG slowing during wakefulness is associated with worsening OSA severity (increased arousal index, AHI or hypoxia)
Early investigations using qEEG analysis in OSA also found increased EEG slowing during REM sleep compared to controls
However, these original findings have since been replicated in a large study examining ambulatory qEEG measures in 664 men (> 40 years), demonstrating a positive association between OSA severity and both the EEG slowing ratio and EEG power in all frequency bands during REM
Importantly, an earlier study by the same authors found greater EEG slowing (delta power) in REM sleep to predict worse simulated driving performance in 76 people with a range of OSA severity
In a small study of 8 males with moderate-severe OSA undergoing an extended wakefulness protocol, greater EEG slowing during REM sleep at baseline was associated with slower PVT reaction times, more PVT lapses, and more AusEd crashes after 24hrs awake.
Across the same time period, decreased spindle density in NREM sleep was also associated with slower PVT reaction times
Most research quantifying EEG microstructure during NREM sleep in those with OSA shows reduced SWA compared to controls
Given more SWS/SWA is associated with better next-day performance both in healthy younger
Of note, only one small study has examined the relationship between SWA and CSF amyloid-β in OSA
In this study, NREM SWA was negatively correlated with CSF amyloid-β levels in controls but not in those with OSA.
Studies using CAP analysis in people with sleep-disordered breathing find CAP subtype A2 and A3 rates and durations are higher compared to controls in: OSA
The extent to which any changes in respiratory-related EEG microstructure events could influence measures of spectral power during NREM is not often acknowledged in investigations reporting EEG changes in those with AD pathology.
This is pertinent given the partial spectral frequency overlap between slow wave oscillations and K-complexes
In respiratory failure patients with sleep-disordered breathing, a positive association between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) and percentage of SWS was observed, indicating abnormal blood gas exchange at night appears to influence the appearance of slow waves
Furthermore, there is evidence that OSA impairs the both the normal homeostatic reduction in SWA and K-complex amplitude across the sleep cycle
Some work by
Although findings are inconsistent, a systematic review of spindle oscillations in sleep disorders
Additionally, different spindle dynamics throughout the nocturnal sleep period are observed in OSA compared to controls
Interestingly, work quantifying spindles in overweight adolescents with OSAS found increased spindle activity (number and density) compared controls matched for age and BMI
A study of EEG spectral power differences between young (~24 years) and older patients (~59 years) with OSAS, not taking medications, found both slow (<13 Hz) and fast (>13 Hz) sigma activity during NREM were higher in the older group and a ratio of slow/ fast sigma activity was positively correlated with OSA severity measures in younger participants only
Despite the well documented association between spindle activity and cognitive functioning
A moderate positive correlation (not statistically significant) between spindles and overnight task improvement has been observed in OSA participants but not controls
Additionally, an enhancement of spindles after learning in OSA patients was not observed by
However, the older age of the participants may explain the lack of effect (average age 52 years in
To date, no studies have been published investigating the effect of OSA on slow oscillation-spindle coupling.

Effects of CPAP treatment on EEG
Adequate CPAP treatment restores sleep macrostructure measures towards that of individuals without OSA, most notably SWS and REM durations increase and sleep latencies to these stages decrease
Beyond these changes in sleep macrostructure and a reduction in respiratoryrelated arousals
Early studies examined small numbers (N~10), of mostly male patients (~80%) and conducted comprehensive EEG analysis on features such as CAP
Later the same group observed progressive normalization of CAP across a month of CPAP with the number of A1 subtype events remaining below the levels of control patients at the end of 30 days consecutive treatment
In this study they also found Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) scores negatively correlated with arousals and CAP rate which was not the case in their earlier study.
Initial studies using spectral power analysis before and after CPAP treatment observed a correction of EEG slowing in wake and REM but not complete resolution of sleepiness
Furthermore, in a similar group of patients the same research group observed increased SWA during the first part of the night after 9 months of CPAP compared to during the untreated baseline sleep
A number of later studies also show several months CPAP treatment partially reverses waking EEG abnormalities (EEG slowing) and improves some daytime functioning
Work investigating the effect of CPAP treatment on sleep spindle characteristics shows increased spindle density during a CPAP titration compared to a diagnostic night PSG
A study of spindle characteristics finds CPAP treatment partially normalizes spindle features of the group towards those seen in healthy controls
There is evidence that K-complexes also change as a result of CPAP treatment.
Work from our group indicates CPAP treatment results in a decrease in KC density and an increase in SWA and slow wave activity surrounding K-complexes (ΔSWAK)
Furthermore, in this analysis ΔSWAK was a significant predictor of vigilance (PVT lapses), where less slow wave activity elicited by a KC was associated with greater performance impairments.
This relationship between sleep EEG and daytime performance was observed not only cross-sectionally in both chronic and acute OSA conditions, but also longitudinally with CPAP treatment.

Summary
There are well documented EEG changes with age and dementia during both wake and sleep states that differ in males and females.
Preliminary findings indicate that in OSA sleep is disrupted such that EEG microstructure is altered in similar ways to those during aging and dementia, but large-scale studies are mostly lacking (Figure
Additionally, high levels of inter-individual variability in neurophysiological responses to SDB and CPAP treatment indicate complex relationships between the severity and chronicity of sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxia that are difficult to disentangle.

Factors beyond Amyloid and Tau
OSA and ApoE-The ApoE gene has 3 common alleles, and carrying one or more copies of ApoE4 is the greatest known genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer disease
In the brain, ApoE protein is produced by astrocytes to transport cholesterol to neurons, a process essential to neuronal membrane function as well as neuronal integrity (such as neurite extension among others)
While some early studies suggested having a single ApoE4 allele increases the odds of having moderate-severe OSA
Work by our group found ApoE genotype can influence the relationship between OSA severity and CSF amyloid-β 42 or tau, with positive associations between OSA severity and both CSF amyloid-β 42 or tau seen in ApoE3 carriers, but either no association (tau) or negative association (amyloid-β 42 ) observed in ApoE4 carriers
However, the number of ApoE4 carriers was very small in comparison to ApoE3 carriers, so additional work is needed to ascertain the influence of ApoE genotype on this relationship.
The effects of ApoE genotype on amyloid burden in general appear to extend to individuals with OSA, as higher cortical amyloid load by PET imaging in participants with OSA carrying the ApoE e4 allele was observed in a cross-sectional study
Negative effects of OSA and ApoE4 carrier status may be synergistic as cognitively normal middle-aged adult ApoE4 carriers had impaired spatial working memory versus non-carriers, only in subjects with comorbid OSA, but not in normally-breathing controls
These studies highlight the complex interaction of OSA severity and ApoE and suggest that untreated apnea can affect biomarkers and subtle cognitive deficits which precede clinical manifestation of AD by a decade.
OSA and Immune factors-Research in AD and sleep fields has identified an important crosstalk between the brain and immune system.
Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain with a diverse set of functions in neurodevelopment, infection response, and neuronal synaptic homeostasis.
These resident immune cells can also be activated by astrocytes, another glial cell type in the brain.
Exactly how OSA affects this crosstalk is largely unknown due to the available methods to measure the immune system.
While microglia secrete cytokines as a response to clear pathogens in the brain, much of the findings from the OSA field come from systemic immune sources measured in the blood.
For example, in moderate to severe OSA, blood derived IL6 and tau were greater than controls without OSA
Other circulating factors like CRP, IL-1Ra, IL-8 and TNF-α show elevation in patients with OSA and an acute cardiovascular event
Nevertheless, missing from the field is widespread adoption of biomarkers of microglial activation from the brain in vivo.
One candidate is YKL-40, an astroglial secreted protein that activates microglia and is shown to track with early cognitive decline in MCI when measured from the CSF (Craig-Schapiro et al. 2010).
In sleep apnea, serum-derived YKL-40 offers a less invasive biomarker but at the cost of still being of systemic immune origin.
For example, elevated levels of serum YKL-40 were found in patients with OSA and coronary artery disease
When measured from the CSF, cognitively normal elderly with subjectively defined poor sleep show detectably higher YKL-40 levels
In order to dissect the role of SWS disruption on multiple CSF derived proteins including YKL-40
These results indicate microglial activation likely requires chronic sleep fragmentation with intermittent hypoxia seen with OSA
Soluble CSF TREM2 is a microglial protein product of a genetic risk factor for AD
Development of PET tracers to monitor microglial activation in vivo and in specific brain areas is actively being investigated in AD and warrants future consideration in OSA
In an animal model of sleep restriction without intermittent hypoxia, morphological evidence for both microglial and astrocytic phagocytosis of synapses suggests one way that the brain responds to prolonged wakefulness in order to maintain synaptic homeostasis
However, dissecting the pathological crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes in OSA will require specific biomarkers that can be assayed both simultaneously and longitudinally in vivo.
OSA and Blood-Brain barrier/Glymphatic system-The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) functionally separates the brain from circulating blood.
Hypotheses have been put forth regarding how OSA may disrupt BBB permeability
Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI indicates patients with OSA have reduced water diffusion across the BBB compared to non-OSA controls
Once the BBB breaks down, circulating cells could be allowed to infiltrate into the brain.
Using perfusion imaging, reduced global cerebral blood flow and increased leucocyte apoptosis, primarily of granulocytes, was found in the OSA group compared to controls
When combined with the finding of regional cerebral blood hypoperfusion, particularly in elderly severe OSA patients
However, this same study found that other brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala and caudate had paradoxically hyperperfusion which correlated positively with AHI, suggesting regionspecific hyperactivity as a result of frequent apneas and hypopneas
Work in animals identified a glymphatic system that clears amyloid-β and other brain metabolites from the interstitial space into the CSF
However, the field is contentious due to lack of evidence for interstitial fluid (ISF) clearance of solutes
Methods to directly measure the exchange of solutes from the ISF to the CSF in vivo in humans are lacking, but one method uses ultrafast magnetic resonance encephalography to identify cardiac, respiratory, and very low frequency pulse-mediated flow in the brain
The temporal relationship between sleep stages and CSF flow has remained an enigma of the sleeping human brain.
Using simultaneous EEG and ultrafast MRI, delta waves were found to precede BOLD and CSF rhythms during slow wave sleep
The authors propose CSF inflow from the 4th ventricle is a new pathway by which CSF and ISF mix during SWS
Ideally, these advanced imaging methods will be applied in future studies to understand how OSA potentially impacts glymphatic clearance.
The disruption of slow wave sleep from OSA and large intrathoracic pressures changes between apneas and recovery breaths could be acting at odds to impact cyclic CSF pulsations and potentially regulate glymphatic clearance.
OSA and Neuronal factors-Orexin (aka hypocretin) is a neuropeptide involved in wake maintenance, arousal and feeding, and is produced primarily in the lateral hypothalamus.
In a mouse model of amyloid overproduction, orexin delivered into the brain increased ISF amyloid-β while a dual orexin receptor antagonist decreased ISF amyloid-β and decreased wake duration across 24 hours
In humans without OSA, an experimental 5 nights of sleep restriction led to increased CSF orexin without increases to amyloid-β, tau, or neuron-derived proteins (neurofilament light, neuron-specific enolase, and fatty acidbinding protein)
In an older cohort of cognitively normal elderly, CSF orexin positively correlated with CSF AD biomarkers amyloid-β, P-tau, and T-tau which was not driven by AHI
Orexin measures in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, however, are inconsistent with one study showing no change in CSF orexin between subject with and without OSA
Additionally, plasma orexin levels in OSA appear tied to sleepiness with higher levels in sleepy subjects with OSA (ESS ≥ 13 vs ESS ≤ 9)
Other promising neuronally derived biomarkers are CSF VILIP-1 and neurogranin which are both shown to be lower in a moderately-severe OSA group compared to mild OSA
These heterogenous findings of neuronally derived biomarkers warrants a larger study of the effect of OSA on markers of neuronal integrity.
Summary-The immune system in particular has gained increasing attention as playing an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD.
OSA likely has direct impact on cytokines and immune cells, as well as access of immune cells to the brain via influences on the blood brain barrier, but an understanding of to what extent these effects impact risk for and progression of AD is in its nascency.

Challenges and Future Directions

Difficulties with definitive trials investigating the effect of CPAP treatment on biomarkers of AD and dementia -Future directions
One fundamental challenge to the intersecting research fields of AD and sleep-disordered breathing appears to be one of measurement, in relation to both defining sleep apnea severity and adequate treatment response.
According to The AASM manual for the scoring of sleep and associated events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications
The hypopnea lacks a single definition and is categorized according to event sequelae (EEG micro-arousal and/or oxygen desaturation events classically, but for example events associated with change in heart rate have been used in research studies).
This heterogeneity results in several fundamental barriers to understanding the negative consequences of OSA, as does the reliance purely on frequency of events.
For example, is someone with an AHI of 10/hour where each event lasts 120 seconds and is associated with significant oxygen desaturation into the 70's better or worse than someone with an AHI of 30/hour where each event lasts 10 seconds and is associated purely with arousal and no change in oxygen?
It is impossible to disentangle sleep fragmentation (due to arousals) and hypoxemia (due to oxygen desaturation) within a single AHI measure.
Furthermore, if large epidemiological or clinical trials are conducted using one definition, it is difficult to integrate research using an alternative definition into existing knowledge.
Perhaps to understand the contribution of fragmentation and hypoxia to negative outcomes in OSA, the field may need to move beyond the AHI for OSA diagnosis.
This could possibly be achieved with more detailed characterization of sleep physiology in OSA during both diagnosis and treatment using novel analysis of existing measures of sleep physiology in PSG.
Novel quantification of the rich oscillatory activity collected from multiple organ systems during PSG creates possibilities for explaining individual variation in vulnerability to the negative consequences of sleep disorders.
This possibility, however, is hampered by the strong push to complete sleep testing at home, where home sleep tests increasingly focus on collecting just enough signals to provide an AHI.
There is a high degree of inter-individual variability inherent to human physiology which likely contributes to our limited understanding about how OSA exerts its negative health effects within an individual
Despite being the most effective and frequently recommended treatment for OSA, CPAP acceptance and compliance rates are variable and can be particularly poor in individuals who are not sleepy or other otherwise symptomatic from their OSA
Furthermore, the benchmark used in clinical and research settings for adequate CPAP usage is greater than 4 hours for at least 70% of nights but this recommendation was selected virtually at random
In partial users of CPAP, the untreated portion of sleep is most typically the latter half, which is rich in REM, a stage of sleep in which OSA is often at its worst due to REM muscle atonia.
Research highlighting the detrimental outcomes of REM related OSA could inform the research agenda concerning AD and sleep
In a secondary analysis of the Sleep Heart Health Study,
Furthermore, REM sleep is reported to be reduced in MCI
In an interesting study focusing on REM related OSA,
While there can be inter-individual variability in OSA, there may also be features common to subsets of individuals that allow for common grouping (i.e.
OSA driven by high upper airway collapsibility vs low arousal threshold)
One area historically neglected in OSA research is sexual dimorphism.
Emerging evidence of significant differences between males and females with respect to OSA phenotypes
Understanding individual rather than group changes in response to treatment with respect to sleepiness, vigilance and cognition will likely yield a better indication on treatment modality or required usage to achieve improvements in daytime functioning for the individual.
Another difficulty with using the AHI as a method of diagnosis and disease severity is the insensitivity to chronicity of disease.
Implicit in understanding the effect of OSA on health is the propensity for adaptive processes in response to stressors to the system, also understood as resilience.
The high level of heritability of sleep EEG
The concept of a resilience brain in the face of perturbations to sleep during SDB offers a framework with which to use sleep EEG microstructure identify biomarkers of neurodegeneration
In a similar vein, non-linear methods of signal analysis
For example,
Perhaps such methods could be applied to sleep EEG quantitatively distinguish 'healthy' homeostatic slow waves from 'detrimental' pathologic slow waves or EEG slowing
Despite the potential for novel measures of sleep to better characterize individual vulnerability to negative consequences of sleep disruption, it also adds to the multitude of sleep features currently tested when investigating the link between sleep, OSA and AD.
To this end, the literature may have considerable publication bias with many measures tested, only significant associations reported and without adequate correction for multiple comparisons.
Based on the available evidence, many would argue that a clinical trial of OSA treatment for AD prevention is warranted.
But there are several fundamental issues in conceptualizing such a trial, many of which are intrinsic to any intervention designed to slow or prevent AD.
The AD field recognizes that there is a long preclinical phase, lasting years to possibly decades, during which changes to the brain occur, including dysfunction of synapses and the accumulation of amyloid and tau before any hint of cognitive change is apparent.
Therefore, an idealized clinical trial for AD prevention would target recruitment of participants who are relatively young and such preclinical brain changes are just beginning to occur.
But this presents the obvious question of how long such a trial would need to last to determine an impact on AD development.
The answer is likely to be many years -10 to 20 would not be out of the question -which negatively impacts the feasibility (and fundability) of such a proposal.
Instead of the development of frank dementia as the primary outcome, intermediate surrogate outcomes could be assessed (e.g.
brain amyloid and/or tau load by PET imaging), but the field still lacks consensus on whether such outcomes ultimately would or would not impact the development of dementia.
While recruitment age, duration of follow-up, and defining primary outcome are problems in designing any AD treatment trial, there are additional issues specific to OSA.
In an idealized trial, one would likely want to recruit individuals who stand the most to gain from treatment -individuals with severe OSA and daytime sleepiness, particularly in light of the observation that all cause sleepiness was shown to be associated with longitudinal accumulation of brain amyloid in older subjects
However, randomizing individuals with severe OSA and daytime sleepiness to a control arm lacking treatment is probably not ethically justifiable, particularly if it would need to occur over many years.
Therefore, one could focus on individuals from the community with incidentally identified severe OSA who lack daytime symptoms.
However, in such individuals, adherence to CPAP in the treatment arm is likely to be quite low, as was observed in a recent clinical trial of CPAP for cardiovascular endpoints
The adherence issue could be minimized by liberalizing the treatment arm to "any intervention that lowers the AHI" below some threshold value, a concept championed by our colleague Dr. David Rapoport, which could include use of mandibular advancement devices, nasal EPAP, positional therapy, or other interventions.
While appealing, the feasibility of using multiple interventions in a trial and tracking adherence as can easily be done with CPAP, are factors that remain to be worked out.
