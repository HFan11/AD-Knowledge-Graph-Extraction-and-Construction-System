Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an accelerating neurodegenerative disorder.
Dysfunction of mitochondria and oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.
Sirtuins play a role in this pathway and can be a potential marker to study neurodegenerative changes.
This study evaluated serum levels of all seven sirtuins (SIRT1 -SIRT7) proteins in three study groups: AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Geriatric Control (GC) by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique.
Further, it was validated by the Western blot experiment.
ROC analysis was performed to differentiate the study group based on the concentration of serum SIRT proteins.
Out of seven sirtuins, serum SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT6 levels (mean+SD) were signi cantly decreased in AD (1.65±0.56,
3.15±0.28,
3.36±0.32ng/µl);
compare to MCI (2.17±0.39,
3.60±0.51,
3.73±0.48ng/µl)
and GC (2.84±0.47,
4.55±0.48,
4.65±0.55ng/µl).
ROC analysis showed the cut-off value with high sensitivity and speci city for cognitive impairment (AD and MCI).
The concentration declined signi cantly with the disease progression.
No speci c difference was observed in case of other SIRTS between the study groups.
This study reveals an inverse relation of serum SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT6 concentration with AD.
ROC analysis showed that these serum proteins have greater accuracy in diagnosing of AD.
This is the rst report of estimation of all seven serum sirtuins and the clinical relevance of SIRT3 and SIRT6 as serum protein markers for AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive loss of memory, executive function, thinking, and behaviour leading to a comprehensive cognitive dysfunction.
The AD symptoms progressed slowly and worsened over time, which later interfered with the activities of daily living
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is explained as impairment of one or more cognitive domains, is the earliest stage of disease, and associated with an increased risk of AD.
At present, AD is un-curable as there is no effective therapy that can delay the onset or slow AD progression.
It is crucial to explore novel and effective treatment strategies for AD.
There is a need to understand the fundamental molecular and cellular involvement in the disease, translating into clinical diagnosis and therapies.
The neuropathological hallmark of AD comprises of extracellular aggregation of β-amyloid peptide and intracellular precipitations of insoluble protein aggregates of phosphorylated microtubule-associated tau protein.
It is also pathologically characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, altered mitochondrial distribution, neuro in ammation, calcium deregulation, metal dis homeostasis, neuro brillary tangle formation and amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomerisation and brillation
Neurodegeneration in AD leads to a signi cant increase in neuronal ROS production
Factors such as cell senescence, oxidative stress and ageing are all crucial factors in the pathogenesis of AD
Many studies have shown the potential role of Sirtuins in ageing and age-related diseases such as AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
The animal and cell culture models showed that SIRT1 plays a neuroprotective role in the brain.
A signi cant reduction in RNA and protein expression levels of SIRT1 in parietal cortex of post-mortem AD patients' brains compared to controls reported in the literature.
Accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau in the cerebral cortex of AD patients is strongly associated with the loss of SIRT1
In our previous study, SIRT1 was downregulated in the blood of AD patients compared to normal older subjects
Study has found an association between AD susceptibility and a polymorphism in an intron of SIRT2 gene
SIRT3 is present in the mitochondrial matrix.
Mitochondria is the main source of ROS and energy production within neurons thus are the critical mediator of age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration
Mitochondrial ROS production increases in the brains of aged mice
Similarly, there is a progressive trend toward a pro-oxidant state as human's age; thus, ROS increases with age
Progressive ROS accumulation in neurons poses a signi cant threat, leading to exacerbated protein aggregation, cell death, and the onset of the pathogenesis of AD, as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases
The overexpression of SIRT1, SIRT3 reduced ROS generation, thereby prevent neuronal death
Absence of SIRT3 causes hyperacetylation of SOD2 (Superoxide dismutase2) and Cyp-D (Cyclophilin D)
Both SIRT1 and SIRT3 levels were found to reduce in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal subregions in the post-mortem human AD brain
SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial function and highly express in the brain
It also mediated antioxidant and metabolic effects, which results in enhanced neuronal survival.
Overexpression of SIRT3 and SIRT1 protect neurons from cellular stresses and ROS formations
Calorie restriction reduced neurodegeneration by up-regulating SIRT3
SIRT3 and SIRT6 expressions change the ageing brain in a region-speci c manner
SIRT3 is also expressed in the tissues of kidney, heart, liver, adipose tissue and brain
SIRT6 is present in the nucleus known as a longevity gene.
It is a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase that has various roles such as telomere maintenance, DNA repair, genome integrity, energy metabolism, in ammation and life span regulation
Accumulation of senescent cells in ageing due to the defective DNA repair and accumulation replication is one of the causes of for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
SIRT6 were de cit in aged mice brain
It is also downregulated in post-mortem brains of AD patients compared to cognitively normal subjects.
It was found that Aβ 42 signi cantly decreased SIRT6 expression, which was associated with a decrease level of p53
Study on brain-speci c SIRT6-knockout (SIRT6KO) mouse model, exhibit accelerated ageing and causes pathological changes in behaviour, presented with accumulated DNA damage, and increased apoptosis and hyperphosphorylated Tau levels.
There was an increase in Tau stability and phosphorylation through GSK3 activation when SIRT6 depleted in cells.
These ndings indicate that SIRT6 protects the brain from naturally accumulating DNA damage, protecting against neurodegeneration
The potential roles of SIRT6 in AD have remained unexplored.
SIRT4, SIRT5 and SIRT7 showed to have different roles in various tissues, but their role in brain was not explored.
Identi cation of biomarker molecules in blood would be more widely applicable than cerebrospinal uid (CSF) due to non-invasiveness, less expensive and very rapid.
Sirtuin protein may be the next target for AD for early diagnosis.
Based on several ndings on involvement of sirtuin proteins in neurodegenerative diseases and evidence from our previous work, this study focused on quantifying all sirtuins in blood of AD, MCI and GC to identify speci c sirtuin to establish it as potential blood-based marker for AD.

Methods

Study Participants
A total of 138 subjects were recruited for the present study.
All participants underwent clinical testing, biochemical testing, and cognitive assessment at the Memory Clinic, Department of Geriatric Medicine of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
The Ethics Committee of AIIMS approved the study protocol (IESC/T-28/03.01.2014).
After providing informed consent, each participant completed a brief questionnaire about their medical history, health behaviours such as addiction, demographic, education pro le, occupation, living status, co-morbidities and disease duration.
Among them, 47 patients diagnosed with AD, 43 patients with MCI and 48 subjects were Geriatric Controls (GC).
All were diagnosed as per the existing diagnostic criteria by the team of geriatricians and a neuropsychologist.
All participants with MCI met Petersen's 2011 criteria: 1) concern about their cognitive de cit in comparison to their previous level; 2) performance that is lower than their age-and education-matched normative; 3) no or minimal impairment in their basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); and 4) not meeting DSM-V-2013 criteria for dementia.
A basic protocol was completed, which included the HMSE, Barthel Activities of Daily Living (BADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
Older subjects above 60 years of age, with no reported major systemic or psychiatric illness, were recruit as geriatric controls (GC).
All the volunteers and informants who accompanied the patients to the Outpatient Geriatric Department gave the consent.
Further, any participant with delirium or any chronic systemic illness and major psychiatric diseases were not included in the study.
All possible reversible clinical causes were rule out at the diagnosis by the geriatrician.
HMSE scores considered for these three groups were: Normal: 26 and above, MCI: 17-25 and AD: less than 17.
AD was diagnosed as per NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria)
Normal control group consist of subjects with no apparent or disability and HMSE score of 26 or more.
Further, each case underwent imaging evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and positron emission tomography (PET) scan of Tau and uorodeoxyglucose (FDG).

Estimation of serum sirtuin levels
Two millilitres collected venous blood samples from all subjects and were allowed to stand for 1 hour.
Serum samples were extracted after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and stored in aliquots at -80°C until the time of experimental work.

By SPR technology
SPR was used for estimation of serum proteins, using the BIAcore-3000 [Wipro GE Healthcare, Sweden], a biosensor-based system for real-time monitoring of speci c interaction analysis.
Primary antibodies; mouse anti-human SIRT1 monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-human SIRT2 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human SIRT3 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human SIRT4 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-human SIRT5 monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human SIRT6 polyclonal IgG (Sigma) and rabbit anti-human SIRT7 polyclonal IgG were immobilized on different ow cells of CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling kit (Wipro GE Healthcare, Sweden).
To prepare the standard curve six different known concentrations of the puri ed recombinant proteins of SIRT1 (0, 3.18, 5.31, 10.62, 15.94, 21.25 ng/µl), SIRT2 ( 0, 1.94, 3.42, 6.84, 11.42 ng/µl), SIRT3 (0, 2.1, 4.2, 6.4, 8.5, 10.7 ng/μl), SIRT4 (0, 1.40, 4.21, 8.43, 11.25, 14.06 ng/µl), SIRT5 (0, 2.7, 4.5, 6.3, 9,12 ng/µl) SIRT6 (0, 2.14, 4.28, 6.42, 8.56, 10.7 ng/µl) and SIRT7 (0, 1.55, 3.87, 5.42, 7.75, 11.62 ng/µl) passed over the respective immobilized antibodies on sensor chip and to obtained RU values.
The serum was passed over the immobilized antibodies.
For each sample, the RU value was recorded and the serum concentration of sirtuins in different subjects was derived from the standard curves.

By Western blot
For further validation, the expression level of proteins in serum was performed by Western blot experiment.
Albumin was removed from Albumin out kit (G-Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by BCA (Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit) to determine the concentration of serum proteins.
The standard curve was plotted using different dilutions of BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin).
The samples were diluted empirically such that the approximate concentration of the protein would fall in the linear range of the standard curve.
Diluted samples were mixed with 200 µl working BCA reagent in 96 well plates and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C.
At 562 nm, the absorbance was measured by ELISA reader.
The protein concentrations of the samples were calculated from the standard curve.
Randomly, three samples were selected, from each group and 30 µg of total protein were loaded on 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
Then transferred to polyvinylidene di uoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Membrane Technologies), after that membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (NFM) which was made in TBS (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature and after that incubated with primary antibodies which were diluted with TBS, containing 1% NFM at 4°C overnight.
Following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-human SIRT1 monoclonal IgG (1:300), rabbit anti-human SIRT3 polyclonal IgG (1:500) and rabbit anti-human SIRT6 polyclonal IgG
Then washing was done with TBS-T (20 mM Tris pH7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies; goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:4000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at room temperature for 1 hour.
After washing with TBS-T, the PVDF membranes were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescent System (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scienti c, Rockford, IL) and my Image Analysis Software (Thermo scienti c) was used to observe the density of bands.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in Stata/SE version 9 and Graph pad prism5 (College Station, TX, USA and GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, USA).
Descriptive analysis was done and presented with mean and standard deviation for all variables.
Two groups were compared by using the Chi-square test for categorical variables and student's t test for continuous variables.
Three groups (AD, MCI and GC) were compared for continuous variables by using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparison using the Bonferroni test.
Correlation between two continuous variables was assessed using the Cary Pearson correlation coe cient.
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed for detecting optimum diagnostic cut-off value of Sirtuin proteins.
Analysis of covariance was done to check the difference in the levels of Sirtuins between controls (GC) and patients (AD, MCI) after adjusting age, gender, education, occupation, and duration.
The p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistical tests were signi cant.

Results

Demographic and clinical data
Descriptive analysis of various demographic and clinical parameters of study subjects are presented in Table
The mean age of AD, MCI and GC subjects were 70.74, 68.62 and 68.23, respectively.
Mean HMSE scores were 13.63, 22.44, 28.31 in AD, MCI and GC groups, respectively.
With respect to sex, age category, location, education, addiction, family history of AD and number of co-morbidities, there were no signi cant differences between groups.
While signi cant differences were observed with respect to occupation, duration of disease, BADL, hypertension, joint disease, MTA score and parietal score between all three groups.
With the increase duration of the disease, the incidence of cognitive impairment also increases and was signi cant among the groups (p<0.0001).

Estimation by SPR
The concentrations of sirtuins in serum were determined from the standard curves using RU obtained from the binding of serum over the sirtuin antibodies.
The immobilized protein concentration of 1 pg/mm2 corresponds to one RU.
Out of seven sirtuins concentration of serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 was found in GC group (SIRT1: 2.84±0.47ng/µl,
95% CI: Hence, SIRT2, SIRT4, SIRT5 and SIRT7 were not signi cant among different groups.
(Fig.
In the analysis of covariance, after adjustment of occupation, duration of disease, joint disease, co-morbidities between three groups, the serum protein levels of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 were found to be signi cantly lower (p<0.0001) in the case of AD group as compared to MCI (p<0.0001) and GC group (p<0.0001).
The values of all three proteins were signi cantly different among the three categories (Table
A signi cant difference was observed in serum protein concentration with respect to age, sex, education, duration of disease, occupation, joint disease, HTN and DM in different groups (Table
ROC analysis was carried out based on SPR data to measure the utility of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 out of seven sirtuins as protein markers for AD and MCI (Fig.
The threshold for detecting AD and MCI was selected based on the distribution of speci cities and sensitivities.
In case of SIRT1, the area under curve (AUC) for distinguishing AD vs GC was 0.9275 (cut-off -2.31 ng/μl; sensitivity -93.75 %; speci city -87.23 %), AUC for distinguishing MCI vs GC was 0.8697 (cut-off -2.52 ng/μl; sensitivity -79.17 %; speci city -76.74%) and AUC for distinguishing AD vs MCI was 0.7905 (cut-off -1.90 ng/μl; sensitivity -76.74 %; speci city -74.47 %).
For SIRT3, the area under curve (AUC) for distinguishing AD vs GC was 0.9969 (cut-off -3.68 ng/μl; sensitivity -97.92 %; speci city -95.74 %), AUC for distinguishing MCI vs Control was 0.9169 (cut-off -3.99 ng/μl; sensitivity -91.67 %; speci city -79.07 %) and AUC for distinguishing AD vs MCI was 0.7840 (cut-off -3.33 ng/μl; sensitivity -74.42 %; speci city -78.72 %).
Similarly, in the case of SIRT6, the AUC for distinguishing AD vs GC was 0. 0.9818 (cut-off -3.97 ng/μl; sensitivity -93.75 %; speci city -93.62 %), AUC for distinguishing MCI vs GC was 0.897 (cut-off -4.1 ng/μl; sensitivity -81.25 %; speci city -76.74 %) and AUC for distinguishing AD vs MCI was 0.7288 (cut-off -3.45 ng/μl; sensitivity -74.42 %; speci city -68.09
%).
This result shows that lower serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 levels can be a distinctive marker of AD.
Pearson correlation analyses evaluated the correlation between protein concentrations (SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6) and HMSE score.
We found that lower HMSE scores were associated with lower concentration of proteins with signi cant positive correlation (Pearson correlation coe cient for SIRT1 r=0.294, p-value <0.0010, SIRT3 r=0.373, p value<0.0001 and for SIRT6 r= 0.307, p-value <0.0001) (Fig.
With respect to age, sex, years of education and duration of disease, no signi cant difference was observed in serum sirtuin concentration among AD, MCI and GC subjects.

By Western blot
Western blot analysis of serum samples was used to validate differential expression of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 in AD, MCI and GC groups obtained by SPR data.
The result showed a low band density of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 proteins in AD and MCI patients compared to GC subjects, as observed in SPR data (Fig.

Discussion
Dementia and speci cally AD in older people, represent a booming public health problem.
AD is one of the most commonly underestimated and underdiagnosed geriatric syndrome in India.
It is challenging for early diagnose AD and MCI due to distinct and subjective clinical features.
There is no de nitive treatment for AD, which implies that the conditions need to detect early to stop further dependence.
Most of the molecules failed to prove them as a potent blood-based biomarker because of the lack of sensitivity and speci city.
Several promising researches are under process which includes brain imaging, cerebrospinal uid proteins, and substances in blood towards establishing biomarkers for dementia, especially AD, but none showed promising marker for early clinical diagnosis.
Previous studies have analysed serum levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3 protein with ageing and found that the expression was downregulated with age
SIRT2, SIRT4, SIRT5 and SIRT7 are largely unexplored for neurodegenerative diseases and the brain.
These proteins are new therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases in recent time due to a critical role in the nervous system.
With this goal, we are here for the rst time quanti ed serum levels of seven sirtuin proteins in AD and MCI patients and compared them with GCs.
In the present study, subjects were more in the age category of 66-75 years.
As per the literature, a cognitive decline and the transformation into dementia which becomes more progressive during this stage.
Male subjects were more dominant than female subjects in our study, which may be due to the social context and lower economic status.
Evaluation Methods such as a clinical score -HMSE and an imaging-MRI Scores were independently assessed for the study groups (AD, MCI, GC) and found signi cant (p<0.0001) with the disease.
We have used standard cut-offs (26 and above) for HMSE scores for our subjects in our setup.
The 50% out of total subjects were normal using HMSE, a highly sensitive scoring system in detecting a cognitive decline in our setup.
All subjects were classi ed by using structural imaging (MRI) using MTA scores, the values were statistically signi cant among the groups.
This study explored the association of serum protein level that changes with AD, MCI patients, and GC subjects.
Pair-wise comparisons between the three groups showed signi cantly lower SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 protein expression in AD patients than in MCI and GC subjects (p<0.0001,
p<0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively).
ROC curves for SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 protein levels were plotted separately and showed reasonably good sensitivity and speci city at the cutoff value for detecting AD and MCI patients compared to GC subjects.
A signi cant correlation (p<0.0001)
existed between serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 concentration with HMSE scores.
A positive correlation of protein with the HMSE score indicates that these serum protein levels decrease with poorer cognitive impairment (HMSE score).
The previous literature supports our present nding, which correlates these proteins and their involvement in AD pathology.
A comparative immunoblotting and immune histochemical study of SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT5 in the AD brain grouped according to Braak and Braak stages of neuro brillary degeneration in a study.
The decrease in SIRT1 expression in neuronal subcellular redistribution with stepwise loss of neuroprotection dependent on the neuronal population and SIRT1 and SIRT3 decrease simultaneously with AD progression and the stage/duration of the disease
It was reported that SIRT3 decreases in AD
Study in mice showed up-regulation of SIRT3 mRNA that followed the spatial and temporal pro les of Aβ accumulation
In the temporal cortex of AD patient's higher level of SIRT3 mRNA was found [39].
SIRT6 depletion causes DNA damage and ageing, reported in a recent study
SIRT6 loss led to tau hyperphosphorylation via the increase in GSK3 activity, with the latter restored with SIRT6 re-expression.
SIRT6 levels are reduced in human AD brain samples and mouse models
These studies suggested that decrease in SIRT6 expression during AD may further enhance neuronal death and degeneration.
In our study, ROC results indicate that serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 have great potential to be diagnostic protein markers for AD for its accuracy in the study group.
This is the rst study to report the circulatory level of all seven sirtuins in serum of AD, MCI and GC subjects and the clinically diagnostic relevance of SIRT3 and SIRT6 as serum protein markers for Alzheimer's disease.

Conclusion
For the rst time, in the present study, we detected and evaluated all serum Sirtuins concentrations in AD, MCI patients and GC to explore the clinical relevance's.
SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 protein expressions in serum were signi cantly low in AD compared to those in MCI and GC subjects.
These protein markers can be potential sensitive diagnostic markers of AD.
A strong inverse correlation between SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 with cognition (HMSE) was identi ed in the study groups.
These results suggest that SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 may be novel blood-based markers for AD.
This study may open up the new vision of blood-based biomarkers for clinical practice and a therapeutic target for AD.
