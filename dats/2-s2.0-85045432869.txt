Derivatization, molecular docking and in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin as a selective anti-Alzheimer agent
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-Is) increase both level and duration of action of acetylcholine (ACh); thus, alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Glycyrrhizin, is the main active compound in liquorice root.
Its aglycone, glycyrrhetinic acid, has shown several beneficial pharmacological activities.
This study reports the synthesis and screening of a series of glycyrrhetinic acid analogs as AChE-Is.
Fourteen derivatives were prepared, of which five derivatives are recorded as new viz., 3-phenyl-carbamoyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (J9), 3-acetyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic-30-anilinamide (J10), 3-acetyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic-30-ethanolamide (J11), 3-acetyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic-30-n-butylamide (J12) and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid-30prenyl ester (J14), in addition to nine known derivatives (J1-J8 & J13).
Compounds J12, J11, J0 and J3 showed remarkable AChE-I activity with IC 50 values of 3.43, 5.39, 6.27 and 8.68 µM, respectively.
These results are in full agreement with the docking study.
The active compounds were non-cytotoxic to normal cells (WI-38).

Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitory Assay
Ellman's method was followed to measure AChE-I activity
The principle depends on the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide (ACTI), the enzyme substrate, into acetate and thiocholine by AChE enzyme.
Then, the produced thiocholine interacts with Ellman's reagent, 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), to give yellow colored product, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate, in a neutral or alkaline pH.
This yellow product can be detected colorimetrically at λ max 405 nm.
(before enzyme addition) were measured using a microplate reader at λ max 405 nm every 16 second/ 10 times.
Then, the reaction was initiated by adding 25 µL of AChE (0.25 U/mL in buffer A) and absorbance were measured every 16 second/ 10 times.
As a negative control (100% enzyme activity), a solution of 25% DMSO (vehicle) was used, while galantamine was used as positive control (standard inhibitor).
Absorbance was plotted versus time, and from the slope, the enzyme activity was calculated and expressed as a percentage in comparison with the negative control.
The absorbance before enzyme addition was subtracted from the absorbance after enzyme addition to correct any increase in absorbance as a result of tested sample color or spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate.

Molecular Docking
Docking experiment was carried out to investigate the active compounds' binding affinity to the AChE active site's binding residues.
From the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB), the crystal structure of aged phosphonylated AChE (code: 1CFJ) was downloaded and imported into Molegro Virtual Docker software (MVD 6.0, Molegro, Aarhus, Denmark).
Removal of water molecules, ligands and all cofactors from the protein structure before docking was done.
The docking experiment was adjusted as previously described
Ligands 3D-structures were drawn using Chemsketch 12.0 software (Cambridge Soft Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) and saved as mol2 formats.
Confirm (OK) compounds were docked inside a sphere with a 15 °A radius centered at the largest cavity (volume 228.352, surface 546.56 °A) detected by the program.
LigPlot + V.1.4
program was used to determine the binding residues.

Antioxidant [ABTS +• ] assay
2,2`-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic-acid)-diammonium salt (ABTS) was dissolved in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL , MnO 2 stock solution also prepared in PBS with concentration of 25 mg/mL and pH was adjusted to 7.0 (0.1 M).
Then ABTS was mixed with MnO 2 with 2:3 ratio, shake vigorously, and finally centrifuged to produce greenish blue solution, (Free radical solution, stable for 1 hr).
Tested compounds at conc. of 0.1 mg/mL were prepared as stock in MeOH/H 2 O, 1:1 solution; then added in a test/reagent ratio 1:9, and incubated for 10 min.
OD was measured at λ max 750 nm

Evaluation of Selectivity and Safety of compounds J0, J3, J11 and J12

Cell lines and drugs
The cytotoxic activity of the compounds was tested against the normal fibroblast of human lung cells (WI-38).
The cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The cells were cultivated at 37°C and 10% CO 2 in DMEM (Lonza, 12-604F) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Lonza, Cat.
No.14-801E), 100 IU/ml pencillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Lonza, 17-602E).
Cisplatin (cis-diamineplatinum (II) dichloride) was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in 0.9% saline then stored as 8 mM stock solution at -20°C.
The synthesized compounds were solubilized in DMSO and stored at -20°C.
0.5% crystal violet was prepared in Methanol and was used to stain the viable cells.
Crystal violet binds to proteins and DNA in the adherent and viable cells so the stain is an indicator for the viability of the treated cells

Cytotoxicity assay
The cells were seeded in 96-well plate as 5*10 4 cells/mL (100 µL/well).
A serial dilutions of tested compounds or cisplatin
DMSO was used as a control (0.1 %).
The cells were incubated for 48 hrs.
After that, 15 µl of MTT (5 mg/mL PBS) was added to each well and incubated for another 4 hours.
The formazan crystals were solubilized by 100 µL acidified SDS solution (10% SDS/0.01
M HCl).
The absorbance was measured after 14 hours of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO 2 at 570 nm by Biotech plate reader.
Each experiment was repeated three times and standard deviation was calculated.
IC50% was calculated as the concentration that cause 50% inhibition for cell growth.
The growth of the cells were monitored and the images were acquired by Gx microscopes (GXMGXD202 Inverted Microscope) (10x Eyepiece) after staining with crystal violet.

Wound healing assay (Abdel
In the second day, a scratch was created in each well by using p200 tip then the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either DMSO or different concentrations of the most active compounds (J0, J3 or J12).
Images were taken at different time points (0, 4, 24 and 48 hours) to monitor the wound closure.
After that the cells were washed two times with ice-cold 1X PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 20 min at 4°C.
The fixed cells were washed two times with 1X PBS and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min.
the extra stain was washed off by dH 2 O until no color in the washing is observed.
Size of the wound was measured by using ImageJ 1.47 software.

Identification of compound J6
1 H-NMR spectrum of compound J6 displayed two methyl doublets (J= 7.0 Hz, each) at   0.91 and 0.97 which may suggest unexpected rearrangement of A-ring.
Carful investigation of the chemical shift of the methyl signals indicated that the change may be in C-23 and C-24, the two methyl groups at C-4.
Additionally, a proton signal at   2.64 (1H, septet, J= 7.0 Hz) was assigned to an isopropyl proton (H-4).
APT spectrum displayed 31 carbon signal of a triterpene-30-methyl ester, with an ,-unsaturated double

AChE from Electrophorus electricus (electriceel), 500 U/mg, and galantamine hydrobromide were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Acetylthiocholine iodide (ACTI) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan).
5,5-Dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid] (DTNB) was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan).Briefly, in each well of a 96-well plate, 25 µL of ACTI (15 mM), 125 µL of DTNB (3 mM) in buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M MgCl 2 .6
H 2 O), 50 µL of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1% BSA) and 25 µL of each tested sample (dissolved in 25% DMSO) were mixed.
The initial absorbance


bond at C-12.
The APT spectrum showed the disappearance of signals corresponding to C-3 and C-5.Interestingly, two quaternary olefinic carbon signals at  C 138.5 and 137.4 were observed instead.
These observations suggested that dehydration may be occurred between C-3 & C-5 position with the cleavage of C 4 -C 5 linkage and the formation of a new double bond.
This assumption was confirmed from HMBC spectrum that showed correlations between the proton signal at   2.64 (H-4) with the carbon signal at  C 138.5 (C-5), 137.4 (C-3), 28.4 (C-2) and 22.0 (C-23).
Moreover, the methyl proton signals at   0.91 (H-24) and 0.97 (H-23) showed HMBC correlations with C-3 confirming their position.
Also, the methyl signal at   1.13 (H-25) showed HMBC correlation with C-5 confirming the position of the double bond.
Thus, J6 was determined to be the known compound apo-allo-glycyrrhetinic-acid-30-methyl ester(Graebin et al.   2010), which was synthesized through the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement.
