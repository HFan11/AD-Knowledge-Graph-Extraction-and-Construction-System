Short-Chain Fatty Acids and Lipopolysaccharide as Mediators Between Gut Dysbiosis and Amyloid Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease
Background: Metagenomic data support an association between certain bacterial strains and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their functional dynamics remain elusive.
Objective: To investigate the association between amyloid pathology, bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs: acetate, valerate, butyrate), inflammatory mediators, and markers of endothelial dysfunction in AD.
Methods: Eighty-nine older persons with cognitive performance from normal to dementia underwent florbetapir amyloid PET and blood collection.
Brain amyloidosis was measured with standardized uptake value ratio versus cerebellum.
Blood levels of LPS was measured by ELISA, SCFAs by mass spectrometry, cytokines by using real-time PCR, and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction by flow cytometry.
We investigated the association between the variables listed above with Spearman's rank test.
Results: Amyloid SUVR uptake was positively associated with blood LPS (rho ≥ 0.32, p ≤ 0.006), acetate and valerate (rho ≥ 0.45, p < 0.001), pro-inflammatory cytokines (rho ≥ 0.25, p ≤ 0.012), and biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (rho ≥ 0.25, p ≤ 0.042).
In contrast, it was negatively correlated with butyrate (rho ≤ -0.42, p ≤ 0.020) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 (rho ≤ -0.26, p ≤ 0.009).
Endothelial dysfunction was positively associated with proinflammatory cytokines, acetate and valerate (rho ≥ 0.25, p ≤ 0.045) and negatively with butyrate and IL10 levels (rho ≤ -0.25, p ≤ 0.038).

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is the most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, featuring extra neuronal accumulation of amyloid-␤ (A␤), and intraneuronal deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau.
However, despite great progress in understanding the dynamics of the molecular pathology, treatments targeted at AD pathology and its modifiers have not yet resulted in a disease modifying therapy.
There is clear evidence that AD is characterized by the presence of a pro-inflammatory status both in the periphery, in term of higher blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and in the brain, in term of activated microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS).
Moreover, A␤ has recently been recognized as an antimicrobial peptide, as part of the innate immune system
Based on this, researchers have recently proposed a potential role for the gut microbiome in the initiation and exacerbation of AD pathology and several preclinical and clinical studies indeed support this hypothesis.
For example, in 2016, for the first time, Minter and colleagues reported that antibioticinduced perturbations in the gut microbiota (GMB) diversity influence neuroinflammation and amyloidosis in a murine model of AD
Subsequently other studies by using the sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA from fecal samples of APP transgenic mice revealed significant differences in the GMB composition compared to that of control wild type mice
Interestingly, in the paper of Harach and collaborators, the authors found also that cerebral A␤ was significantly reduced in germ-free APP transgenic mice and that their recolonization with microbiome coming from conventionally raised APP transgenic mice increased cerebral A␤ pathology, and this increase was less effective when wild type mice microbiota was used.
Preclinical data have been also supported by clinical data, where the pres- .
Indeed, changes spread of the inflammatory status from the gut to the blood and to the brain.
The GMB is also known to produce several metabolites through fermentation on non-digestible carbohydrates with neuroprotective properties [13] that directly or indirectly affect brain functions.
Among these, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are known to beneficially modulate the peripheral and central nervous systems and have been already suggested to play a central role in AD
In particular, it has been hypothesized that SCFAs may attenuate AD by serving as substrates for energy metabolism
Recent evidence also suggests that SCFAs may help to modulate maturation and function of microglia in the brain
More recently, it was also shown that butyric acid may provide therapeutic benefits for AD through epigenetic mechanisms of action by inhibiting histone deacetylase and normalizing aberrant histone acetylation
This evidence suggests that the production of SCFAs in the gut may represent another biological mechanism through which the gut microbiome may influence AD.
In this study we aimed at evaluating whether inflammatory mediators and bacterial products are potential pathogenic links between the GMB and amyloid pathology in AD via endothelial dysfunction.
To this purpose, we tested the associations of brain amyloidosis with blood levels of LPS, SCFAs, cytokines, and several markers associated with endothelial dysfunction in a cohort of elderly subjects with cognitive performance ranging from normal to dementia.
In particular, the gene expression measurement was performed for the pro-inflammatory mediators IL1␤, NLRP3, IL6, CXCL2, CXCL10, TNF␣, and IL18 as well as for the anti-inflammatory mediators IL10 and IL4.
Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and each target gene was normalized to the expression of three reference genes, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, and beta-2microglobulin, using Taqman Assays on a 384 wells Real Time PCR System (Biorad).
The expression levels of each target gene were normalized to the geometric mean of all three reference genes, and the Pfaffl method was used to determine relative target gene expression of each gene in patients as compared with controls.
The primer sequence for each of the genes is available on request to the authors.

Participants

GMB-related products
LPS was measured in plasma by ELISA (Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientifics) and SCFAs levels (i.e., acetate, propionate, valerate, and butyrate) using gas chromatography (GC) according to the following procedure.
Briefly, after thawing at room temperature (RT), 400 microliters of plasma were deproteinized by the addition of 50 microliters of 16% (W/V) metaphosforic acid and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. After, an incubation at 60 • C for 30 min was performed to completely precipitate the protein fraction.
Successively, all samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and filtered at 0.2 micron.
The SCFA determination was performed using the GC DANI 1000

RESULTS

Demographic and clinical characteristics were as
expected for this population with the exception for the low prevalence of hypertension (Table
Considering the broad range of age and cognitive performance of the cohort included in the present study, we first explored the association between age and global cognition with brain amyloidosis, blood levels of LPS, SCFAs, cytokines, and adhesion molecules (Supplementary Figure
Age was associated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF␣ and the adhesion molecules VCAM-1, CD44, and ICAM-3 (0.22 ≤ rho ≤ 0.40, p < 0.046).
Global cognition, measured using MMSE and ADAS-cog, wan mainly associated with valerate, IL1␤, CXCL2, and IL10, several adhesion molecules as well as with all the markers of brain amyloidosis (0.25 ≤ rho ≤ 0.42, p < 0.040).

Brain amyloid load is associated with circulating GMB-related products
In order to improve our understanding on the relationship between brain amyloid deposition and GMB, we measured the plasma levels of the Gram-negative membrane protein LPS and four SCFAs produced by the intestinal bacteria, namely acetate, propionate,

Endothelial dysfunction is associated with circulating GMB products, inflammatory mediators, and brain amyloid load
To verify our hypothesis that GMB products and systemic inflammation compromise blood-tissue barrier integrity leading to vascular damage and AD pathogenesis, we measured the plasma levels of a panel of adhesion molecules.
The upregulated expression of such molecules is one of the phenotypic features of endothelial dysfunction.
Among the GMB products, the SCFAs acetate and valerate were found consistently associated with endothelial damage (Fig.
Indeed, elevated levels of acetate and  These molecules, found increased in the plasma AD patients

Direct and indirect via endothelial dysfunction
In addition to the pathways described above, cytokines might have a direct effect on amyloid aggregation or indirect via endothelial dysfunction.
Increased local and systemic expression of cytokines have been reported in AD patients
Cytokines as IL-1␤ and TNF-␣ are produced by microglia and astrocytes in response to exogenous and endogenous insults
Inflammatory mediators as IL1, IL6, IL18, TNF-␣, and TGF-␤1 affect A␤PP expression level
Moreover, chemokines produced in response to amyloid deposition, are responsible for the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, such as monocytes
neutrophils, and T cells
These findings can be interpreted in the light of the emerging role of A␤ 42 as a physiological mediator of the innate immune system
Thus, its production in the brain may be a protective response to bacterial and viral infections
In line, synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting
Porphyromonas gingivalis, the keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis identified in the brain of AD patients, reduced the brain bacterial load, blocked A␤ 42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus of infected mice
Besides, it is also plausible that amyloid deposition in the brain is the results of age-related defects in the immune signals that monitor the molecular mechanisms implicated in its production, degradation, and clearance.
It is well known that BBB endothelial cells respond to inflammatory stimuli by generating vasoactive substances and through the modification of tight junction structures that increased barrier permeability
Specific inflammatory mediators have been shown to be associated with the evolution of the BBB disruption
Moreover, IL1␤ induced changes in BBB permeability
IL-6 has been shown to disrupt the integrity of the BBB in rat brain endothelial cells
The theory of inflammaging describes the lowgrade, chronic, systemic inflammation in aging, in the absence of overt infection ("sterile" inflammation)
While the features of inflammaging remain "normal" or "subclinical" in many elderly individuals, a portion of individuals (postulated to have a "high responder inflammatory genotype") may shift to age-associated diseases
This shift has been proposed to serve as a prodrome or an exacerbating factor for development of AD
Among the major identified sources of inflammaging, there are endogenous host-derived cell debris, amyloids, free radicals, immunosenescence as well as products and metabolites produced by the GMB
Thus, our results fit well the hypothesis that poses inflammaging as the link between the gut microbiome alteration, that triggers and sustains systemic inflammation, and the inflammation leading the onset of the pathological hallmarks of AD
This study has a number of limitations.
First, we have not studied the effect of APOE genotype on the reported associations.
The allele 4 of APOE is a known risk factor for brain amyloidosis and AD.
While the effect of APOE genotype on GMB composition is unknown, the role of host's genome on the selection and growth of gut bacteria is well known
Second, we have not taken into consideration oxidative stress, known to be contributes to endothelial damage
Interestingly, GMB appears to be an electron acceptor and, by shaping the redox potential of the gut, influences the permeability of the intestine



77 ence
of alterations in the composition of the gut 78 microbiome have reported in AD patients as com-79 pared to control individuals [6, 7].
Our research group 80 in 2016 demonstrated an increased abundance of 81 proinflammatory Escherichia/Shigella and decreased 82 abundance of anti-inflammatory Eubacterium rectale 83 in patients with cognitive impairment and brain amy-84 loidosis and also an association of their abundances 85 with peripheral inflammation [8].
A subsequent study 86 that used a 16S sequencing approach revealed that 87 the GMB profile in AD patients is characterized by 88 a reduced microbial diversity, decreased abundance 89 of Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium and an increased 90 abundance of Bacteroidetes; interestingly, the rela-91 tive bacterial abundance correlated with the increase 92 of cerebrospinal fluid markers of AD pathology [7].
93 There are several pathways through which the gut 94 bacteria may influence brain functioning and promote 95 neurodegeneration in the context of AD pathology.
96 One of these biological processes is represented 97 by inflammation: microbes are known to influence 98 the development and regulation [9] of the immune 99 system and, therefore, may alter the interaction 100 between the immune and the nervous systems.
The 101 gram-negative membrane protein lipopolysaccharide 102 (LPS), which has pro-inflammatory properties, was 103 found in amyloid plaques and around vessels in 104 AD brain [10].
Moreover, LPS levels have been 105 found significantly higher in plasma samples of AD 106 patients as compared to controls [11], and a posi-107 tive association was found between LPS levels and 108 degree of blood monocyte/macrophage activation.

BioLegend) 278 was used to measure the plasma level of the follow-279 ing cell adhesion molecules (CAMs): intracellular 280 CAM 1, 2 and 3 (ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-281 3, respectively), vascular CAM (VCAM-1), platelet 282 endothelial CAM 1 (PECAM-1), activated leukocyte 283 CAM 1 (ALCAM-1), epithelial CAM (EpCAM), 284 neural CAM (NCAM), endothelial selectin (E-285 selectin), platelet selectin (P-selectin), leukocyte 286 selectin (L-selectin), platelet endothelial CAM 1 287 (PSGL-1), and CD44.
Briefly, the surface of each flu-288 orescent bead set is conjugated with specific capture 289 antibodies so that they can be considered as capture 290 beads.
The fluorescent capture beads are incubated 291 in 1:50 diluted human plasma samples containing 292 the target molecules for 2 hr at room temperature in 293 a V-bottom 96 well plate in continuous shaking in 294 the dark.
Successively, after 2 wash steps, a biotiny-295 lated detection antibody mix (25 mL) is added to each 296 well and incubated for 1 h at RT in continuous shak-297 ing.
In this way, each detection antibody will bind 298 to its specific analyte bound on the capture beads 299 (capture bead-analyte-detection antibody sandwich).
300 Then, a 25 mL volume of streptavidin-phycoerythrin 301 (SA-PE) solution is subsequently added and incu-302 bated for 30 min at RT.
The binding to the biotinylated 303 detection antibodies will provide a fluorescent sig-304 nal (FL2 channel) intensities in proportion to the 305 amount of bound analytes.
After a final wash step, 306 the 96-well reading was performed using a Beckman-307 Coulter Cytoflex flow cytometer equipped with a 308 plate reader.
For each well, a minimum of 6,000 309 events was recorded.
Since the beads are differentianalyte-specific populations can be segregated using 312 forward and side scatters properties followed by FL4 313 channel fluorescence analysis (each bead set has a different FL4 intensity).
The PE fluorescent signal quantified will be proportional to the concentration of tested adhesion molecules according to the standard curve generated in the same assay.
The flow cytometry data were uploaded in FCS-3.0 file format on the LEGENDplex™ Cloud-based Data Analysis Software (Dec 05, 2019, BioLegend) for analyte quantification.
Each sample included was tested in duplicate.
Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using Graph-Pad Prism (v 8.1.1)
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Unadjusted associations of the variables listed above were assessed with Spearman's rank correlation, the nonparametric version of the Pearson correlation which reduces the influence of extreme values.
The effect of age and global cognition on the correlation coefficients and p-values was calculated using the Partial and Semi-Partial (Part) Correlation ("ppcor") R package (v 1.1) [21].
Significance was set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed).

valerate were moderate or strongly associated with high levels of almost all the endothelial markers considered (0.25 ≤ rho ≤ 0.46, p ≤ 0.045).
In contrast, butyrate seemed involved in the maintenance of the endothelial integrity, as suggested by its negative associations with NCAM, P-Selectin, and PSGL-1 (-0.35 ≤ rho ≤ -0.25, p ≤ 0.038).
LPS was weakly associated only with P-Selectin (rho = 0.23, p = 0.099).
Overall, elevated levels of adhesion molecules were associated with high expression of proinflammatory cytokines (0.26 ≤ rho ≤ 0.42, p ≤ 0.040) and low expression of the anti-inflammatory IL10 (-0.29 ≤ rho ≤ -0.26, p ≤ 0.027).
IL4, usually considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, showed a correlation profile similar to that identified for the pro-inflammatory cytokines as it was positively associated with 6 out of 13 adhesion molecules (0.27 ≤ rho ≤ 0.40, p ≤ 0.036).
Finally, elevated levels of CD44, NCAM, ICAM-2, P-Selectin, E-Selectin, PECAM-1, PSGL-1, ICAM-1, and ICAM-3 were associated with amyloid deposition in almost all the cortical regions considered (0.25 ≤ rho ≤ 0.52, p ≤ 0.042).
Similar findings were obtained adjusting the Spearman's Rank Correlations for age or global cognition measured using MMSE (Supplementary Figure4).

the transendothelial migration of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB)[31, 32]  and have been proposed to initiate the endothelial signaling cascade and influence the progression of neuroinflammation [32].
Increased levels of E-Selectin and P-selectin has been also reported in the plasma of AD patients [33, 34].
The former has been associated with vascular changes [34], the latter with fast cognitive decline [33].
Moreover, AD platelets show a significant increase in surface expression of P-selectin, that represents a marker of granule secretion [33, 35].
This pre-activated state of circulating platelets in AD patients has been proposed to contribute to dementia progression by triggering perivascular inflammation, induction of vasoconstriction, and consecutive brain hypoperfusion in addition to contributing to the peripheral A␤ pool [33].
The expression of the NCAM, considered an indicator of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity, is altered in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients compared with controls [36, 37].
The decrease of NCAM expression has been associated with cholinergic system alterations in the prefrontal and temporal cortex of humans [38] and inversely associated with phosphorylated tau, the other hallmark of AD pathology, in the murine entorhinal cortex [39].
In vitro studies using glioblastoma cells shown that CD44 induced neurodegeneration through the phosphorylation of tau [40] and attenuated the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway [41], recently found altered in several AD-related brain regions and proposed as an early event in AD development [42].
Furthermore, increased CD44 gene expression has been reported in lymphocytes derived from AD patients [43].
The effect of SCFAs and LPS on amyloid pathology: Direct and indirect via endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation Direct evidences of the impact of SCFAs and LPS on amyloid aggregation come from in vitro and preclinical studies.
Butyrate, but not acetate, inhibited the in vitro aggregation of soluble and neurotoxic A␤ 42 aggregates by interfering with the initial protein-protein interactions [14].
