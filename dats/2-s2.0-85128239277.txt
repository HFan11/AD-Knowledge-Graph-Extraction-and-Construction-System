Iron Dyshomeostasis and Ferroptosis: A New Alzheimer’s Disease Hypothesis?
Iron plays a crucial role in many physiological processes of the human body, but iron is continuously deposited in the brain as we age.
Early studies found iron overload is directly proportional to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein, both of which are related to the AD pathogenesis, are associated with brain iron metabolism.
A variety of iron metabolism-related proteins have been found to be abnormally expressed in the brains of AD patients and mouse models, resulting in iron deposition and promoting AD progression.
Amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau, two pathological hallmarks of AD, can also promote iron deposition in the brain, forming a vicious cycle of AD development-iron deposition.
Iron deposition and the subsequent ferroptosis has been found to be a potential mechanism underlying neuronal loss in many neurodegenerative diseases.
Iron chelators, antioxidants and hepcidin were found useful for treating AD, which represents an important direction for AD treatment research and drug development in the future.
The review explored the deep connection between iron dysregulation and AD pathogenesis, discussed the potential of new hypothesis related to iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis, and summarized the therapeutics capable of targeting iron, with the expectation to draw more attention of iron dysregulation and corresponding drug development.

INTRODUCTION
Iron is the most abundant transition element on Earth
It plays an indispensable role in many physiological and pathological processes of the body.
Iron homeostasis is even more crucial in the brain to maintain its normal function.
Iron dyshomeostasis within the brain can cause oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, leading to cell damage and finally neurological diseases.
Ferroptosis, a programmed cell death process associated with iron dysregulation, has been supposed to be linked to neurological diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and there is no effective clinical drug yet that can delay its progression, posing a serious burden on patients' families and the whole society.
β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque and tau tangles are the pathological hallmarks of AD, accompanied by neuronal loss and damage to brain tissue
Growing evidence have proved that Aβ triggers the chain events downstream in the pathological course of AD, including tau pathology.
However, other processes such as neural inflammation
Some of these processes are even involved in the deposition of Aβ.
Up to date, it is impossible to explain AD with a single pathological path.
Currently, metal dyshomeostasis in AD has been extensively studied
Studies have found intracellular iron deposition even before the formation of senile plaques
This review aimed to discuss the associations of AD pathogenesis with iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis, in order to highlight the hypothesis regarding iron-induced AD and the possibility of targeting iron and ferroptosis to treat AD.

IRON METABOLISM IN HEALTHY AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE BRAIN
About 48% of the iron in the body is bound to hemoglobin and is involved in oxygen transport in the body
About 17% of the iron is found as the cofactor in proteins
In the brain, iron is involved in myelination, neurotransmitter synthesis, and antioxidant enzyme function, and its entry and exit are tightly regulated by a variety of molecules.
Aging

Iron Transport Across Blood-Brain Barrier
In the brain, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), responsible for the strict control of the level of iron transported into the brain
After circulating iron forming a complex (holo-Tf) with transferrin (Tf), it binds to TfR1 on the surface of the BMECs, followed by entry into the BMECs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis
Fe 3+ detaches from Tf in the acidic environment of the endosome and is reduced to Fe 2+ by six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostrate 3 (STEAP3)
It then enters the cytoplasm via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)
Fe 2+ in BMECs can then enter the brain by the secretion of ferroportin 1 (FPN1) followed by the oxidation by extracellular ceruloplasmin (Cp) or hephaestin
There is also a hypothesis that iron could be transported to the brain interstitium through transcytosis in the form of holo-Tf based on the observation of lack of DMT1 in BMECs
Not transferrin-bond iron (NTBI) can cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) via receptor-mediated transcytosis after binding to heavy-chain ferritin (H-ferritin;
It was also reported that Lf increased in the brains of aged individuals and those with AD

Iron Transport and Storage Within the Brain

Neuronal Iron Metabolism
TfR1 is highly expressed on the surface of neurons
NTBI can also enter neurons in a DMT1-dependent manner independent of Tf.
Cellular prion protein (PrPC) is abundantly expressed on the surface of neuronal membranes.
It functions as a ferrireductase partner for DMT1, mediating Fe 2+ uptake in the plasma membrane in the form of complex PrPc/DMT1
PrPC knockout in mice can lead to iron deficiency in brain and uptake increase of holo-Tf
By comparing the brain tissues of juvenile, adult, and aged rats that had the pathological features of AD,
They supposed that DMT1 may be one of the main reason why the iron concentration in the brain gradually increases with age
Some Fe 2+ undergoes normal metabolism in the cytoplasm of neurons, while some is stored in ferritin in the form of non-toxic Fe 3+
Ferritin is positively correlated with iron overload and is found deposited in senile plaques in the AD brain
It had been shown that there was an age-dependent increase in ferritin in the brain
Autopsy studies of AD patients have revealed that mitochondrial ferritin is upregulated
Ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients has been shown significantly increased, which is negatively correlated with cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy in AD
Additionally, iron can enter mitochondria to form iron sulfur cluster and participate in participate in the process of aerobic respiration
Regarding the transport of excess iron out of neurons, FPN1 is the only known iron exporter
Both Cp and hephaestin (Heph) can oxidize Fe 2+ and facilitate FPN1to export iron
Decrease of any of these three export proteins can induce iron retention and consequently the memory impairment
It was reported that FPN1 was downregulated in the brains of AD patients and triple-transgenic AD mouse models
Since Cp is a crucial partner of FPN1 to oxidize Fe 2+ before it is excreted by FPN1, the dysfunction of Cp serves as an upstream event of iron retention, which has been found in AD
Noteworthy, both of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are the substrates of the AD hallmarks in pathological condition, are crucial for neuronal iron efflux
APP is defined as a metalloprotein involved in iron homeostasis
With the assistance of soluble tau protein, APP is transported to the cell membrane
APP or tau knockdown can lead to abnormal FPN1 function and the inability of neuronal iron to flow out normally, resulting in neuronal iron overload
APP with the pathogenic Italian mutation A673V is more prone to be cleaved by β-secretase to produce Aβ1-42, impeding its support of FPN1 and thus increasing iron retention
Because of the continuous cleavage of APP and hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD brain, the iron efflux was hindered in neurons

Glial Support for Neuronal Iron Metabolism
Glial cells help to maintain the iron availability at a safe level in neurons.
Astrocytes and microglia respond during iron overload or deficiency in order to maintain neuronal iron homeostasis.
As a buffer pool, astrocytes express abundant TfR1 and DMT1
Microglia also express TfR1 and reduce iron toxicity by promoting the influx of excess iron (for storage in ferritin) via the TfR1/DMT1 pathway
Microglia and astrocytes are capable of releasing ferritin carrying Fe 3+ to supplement the iron deficiency or to support oligodendrocytes for myelination or remyelination
Iron is essential for myelination in oligodendrocytes, which are the most iron-rich cell type in the brain.
TfR1 is absent in oligodendrocytes
Noteworthy, when iron is overloaded, oligodendrocytes provide an antioxidant defense for neurons by secreting H-ferritin, scavenging extracellular extra iron

Regulators of Iron Homeostasis Proteins in the Brain

Transcription Factors and Iron Regulatory Element/Iron Regulatory Protein Interaction
At the transcriptional level, many of the intracellular iron homeostasis-related genes described above can be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factorα (HIFα).
Most of the mRNAs related to the intracerebral iron metabolism have a hairpin-like structure known as iron regulatory element (IRE)
The iron regulatory protein 1/2 (IRP1/2) is the iron sensor, which can bind to the IRE, post-transcriptionally regulating those iron homeostasis-related proteins.
In a low iron or hypoxic state in cells, HIFα is activated and upregulates IRP.
IRP then binds to the IRE at the 3 -untranslated region (UTR) end of TfR1 and DMT1 mRNAs, to promote their translation, and to the IRE at the 5 -UTR end of ferritin, FPN1, and APP mRNAs, to inhibit their translation
As a result, iron intake is increased, stored iron is released, and iron efflux is reduced.
However, under iron overload, HIFα is degraded, and the IRP-IRE interactions lead to iron storage in neurons and increased iron efflux
Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of intracellular oxidative stress and is also involved in the regulation of iron metabolism-related proteins.
Nrf2 is able to upregulate FPN1
Decrease of Nrf2 could be one of the means for defense against iron overload in the brain
Nevertheless, most of the target genes of Nrf2 have antioxidative property
This will be discussed in the part of "Ferroptosis and AD."

Hepcidin
Hepcidin is a polypeptide that plays a major role in regulating peripheral iron homeostasis, and it has also been shown to be expressed in cortical neurons, intracerebral BMECs, and glial cells
It binds to FPN1 in the cell membrane of BMECs, and then the hepcidin/FPN1 complex is internalized and degraded
From this perspective, hepcidin is beneficial in preventing iron overload in neuron and maintaining iron homeostasis in the brain
Studies have found hepcidin decreased in AD affected neurons
The AD symptoms and Aβ burden can be ameliorated by astrocyte hepcidin
Therefore, it is partially accepted that hepcidin is protective as an iron homeostasis regulator in the brain.
However, it was also reported that hepcidin mRNA and protein increased in the brain with aging
Up to date, studies on hepcidin in brain iron regulation remain controversial.
How hepcidin allowing the normal iron efflux from neurons while causing FPN1 degradation remains an important issue to be studied.

Apolipoprotein E
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a protein responsible for the cholesterol transport to neurons, and also regulates Aβ transport and deposition.
The allele ε4 of APOE (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD.
CSF ferritin level is positively correlated with apoE4 expression, and it can be enhanced in APOE4 carriers
In old-aged individuals, cortical iron burden was found more severe by quantitative susceptibility mapping in APOE4 carriers
Therefore, brain iron deposition caused by APOE4 may be one of the reasons why APOE4 allele predisposes individuals to AD
Interestingly, increased extracellular iron levels can upregulate APOE4 expression in the neurons, but reduce the secretion of it, thereby reducing its ability to clear extracellular Aβ and aggravating Aβ deposition
From recent studies, iron could be the link between APOE4 and AD.

IMPACT OF IRON OVERLOAD ON ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOLOGY
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by senile plaque and NFT pathologically.
Senile plaque derives from the accumulation of insoluble Aβ, which is cleaved from APP by β-secretase.
Hyperphosphorylation of tau is proposed to be the downstream event of Aβ formation.
The pathological mechanism of AD is too complex to explain it merely with Aβ and tau accumulation.
Scientists have found that many pathological processes, for instance, neural inflammation
Currently, the involvement of iron in the early pathology of AD has been well accepted since the discovery of the link between dysregulation of brain iron homeostasis and AD pathogenesis in 1953
In the preclinical stage of AD, there is significant abnormal iron elevation in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons
The iron overload in the brain is corresponding to the severity of AD lesions and the rate of cognitive decline
It is also proposed that hippocampal iron deposition could be the predictor of the rate of cognitive decline caused by Aβ
Iron overload drives a series of events, including glial activation, formation of Aβ plaque and tau tangles, and even neuronal loss

Iron Interaction With Aβ Plaques and Neurofibrillary Tangles
Iron accumulation was demonstrated to accelerate senile plaque deposition and the production of neurofibrillary tangles
Autopsy evidence and magnetic resonance imaging analysis provide evidence that there are a large amount of iron deposition not only in and around senile plaques
Perturbations in iron homeostasis is one of key players in Aβ deposition.
High intracellular iron concentration enhances the interaction of IRP/IRE, inducing APP upregulation.
Furthermore, the enzymes that cleave APP named αand β-secretase are tightly balanced and modulated by furin
More β-secretase is activated when αsecretase is suppressed by furin impairment in the condition of excessive iron
Upregulated APP is cleaved by more β-secretase to Aβ40/42, accelerating the Aβ deposition.
Meanwhile, APP can no longer assist FPN1, resulting in impaired iron efflux and aggravated iron deposition
Some researchers have even proposed that Aβ is non-toxic in the absence of redox metals and that aggregation of Aβ requires the involvement of metals
Soluble Aβ binds to Fe 3+ when extracellular iron increases, so as to remove excess iron, but it is difficult to dissociate them after they interact; Aβ can promote the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) released during this process allows Aβ to be deposited more easily and rapidly, forming more senile plaques
The interactions of iron with APP and Aβ greatly increase the formation rate and degree of senile plaques
Therefore, some researchers believe that iron deposition should be included in the "Aβ cascade hypothesis" of AD
Iron can also interact with tau.
Reduced soluble tau in the brain of AD patients increased brain iron deposition by suppressing FPN1 activity
On the contrary, a diet high in iron can lead to cognitive decline in mice, increased abnormal tau phosphorylation in neurons, and abnormal expression of insulin pathway-related proteins.
Insulin supplementation can reduce iron-induced phosphorylation of tau
In vivo research has found that iron can be involved in tau hyperphosphorylation by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)/P25 complex and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)
Excessive intracellular Fe 2+ -induced production of oxygen free radicals can also promote tau hyperphosphorylation by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways

Iron Overload and Glial Activation
Glial activation and neuroinflammation has been demonstrated to be a prominent characteristic of AD pathology
Microglial are highly reactive cells responding to increased iron levels in the brain.
When iron level increases in brain, microglia become activated
Iron may activate microglia through proinflammatory cytokines mediated by the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
After activated, they express more ferritin to scavenge the extracellular iron
Activated microglia also secret Lf, which can interact with APP, promoting the Aβ formation
Conversely, formation of Aβ induces more IL-1β expression in microglia in the environment of elevated iron, exacerbating the proinflammatory effects
Astrocytes are highly resistant to metal-induced toxicity within the brain
In the environment of high iron, astrocytes respond with a significant increase in glutathione, catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase levels to resist the oxidative stress
They show less impairment by iron than neurons and oligodendrocytes
But later, the astrocytes were found activated with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
Activated astrocytes release inflammatory mediators and induce oxidative stress, which facilitate the formation of Aβ and tau tangles and hinder Aβ clearance

Iron Overload Induces Oxidative Stress and Neuronal Loss
Iron toxicity is largely based on Fenton chemistry.
As a redoxactive transition metal, iron is a key player during the process of oxidative stress.
Elevated iron promotes the production of ROS, which further depletes the cellular antioxidant GSH and promotes lipid peroxidation
This will be discussed in the next part.

FERROPTOSIS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

Ferroptosis in Brain
Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death process discovered by
Ferroptosis is characterized by iron overload and triggered by iron-driven pile-up of the lipid peroxides to a lethal level
The morphological changes of cells undergoing ferroptosis include cell swelling, reduced or absent mitochondrial cristae, decreased mitochondrial membrane density, nuclear chromatin condensation, and finally mitochondrial and cellular membrane rupture
It can be halted by iron chelators, antioxidants, and ferroptosis blockers.
With age, iron is gradually deposited in the body and iron deposition in the brain is more pronounced than in other organs.
In addition, brain contains the highest level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are the preferential substrate for lipid peroxidation in the process of ferroptosis.
So it is not surprising that brain is more susceptible to undergo ferroptosis.
So far, ferroptosis has been found in neurodegenerative diseases
It remains elusive of the precise role of iron even though it is indispensable in the execution of ferroptosis.
Fe 2+ itself has oxidation ability; it can produce a large amount of ROS via the Fenton reaction when it accumulates in excess
This directly induces peroxidation of PUFA and leads to the lethal accumulation of the hydride PUFA-OOH
Additionally, iron accumulation can activate iron-dependent lipoxygenases (LOXs)
Neuronal ferroptosis can be caused by both mechanisms.
Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is the primary enzyme that negatively regulate ferroptosis.
It physiologically reduces PUFA-OOH to non-toxic PUFA-OH
The intracellular level of glutathione (GSH; comprising cysteine, glycine, and glutamate), which is used by GPX4, is affected by the intracellular cysteine level.
When the glutamate/cystine antiporter (xCT) encoded by SLC7A11 is inhibited under the condition of inflammation, aging, and other factors, the level of intracellular cysteine is reduced, resulting in insufficient GSH for the biosynthesis of GPX4
Excessive PUFA-OOH cannot be detoxified and accumulates to a lethal level, triggering ferroptosis
Therefore, the dysfunction of xCT or GPX4 represents an upstream factor in neural ferroptosis
Restoration the functions of GPX4, GSH, or xCT has been demonstrated to be one of the strategies to inhibit ferroptosis
If ferritin, the major iron storage protein in cells, binds to its cargo receptor, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) under the condition of inflammation, it is transported to lysosomes for autophagic degradation
This is an important trigger for ferroptosis in cells.
It has been found that multiple autophagy genes were associated with ferroptosis, while blocking or knocking down these genes reduced ferroptosis
Thus, ferroptosis is considered to be an autophagic process.

"Ferroptosis Hypothesis" of Alzheimer's Disease
After the discovery of ferroptosis in 2012, research on ferroptosis continued, and the involvement of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases has now been widely accepted.
Ferroptosis may be a potential mechanism of neuronal loss in many neurodegenerative diseases
Thus, iron and ferroptosis are supposed to be the promising therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
The characteristic neuronal morphology of ferroptosis was observed; the biomarkers of ferroptosis named acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 (ACSF2) and iron response element binding protein 2 (IREB2) were both upregulated; GPX4 was downregulated in FPN1 deletion mice as well as in APP/PS1 mice
FPN1 restoration or ferroptosis inhibitors named liproxstatin-1 and ferrostatin-1 improved memory impairment in both types of the mice
This not only indicated that abnormal expression of FPN1 solely is capable of inducing AD, but also implicated the role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD.
The mRNA GPX4 and its protein level have been both found to be aberrantly expressed in the brains of AD patients and mice
In glial cells, a mild hypoxic state is capable of decreasing the level of GSH, which is used for the biosynthesis of GPX4
In AD mouse models, GSH expression is reduced in the cortex and is positively correlated with cognitive decline
Some researchers have proposed that GSH levels in the frontal lobe and hippocampus may serve as a biomarker to predict AD and mild cognitive impairment
The xCT activity determines GSH availability and, subsequently GPX4 activity in the brain
Furthermore, studies have found that most of the proteins that involved in ferroptosis can be regulated by Nrf2
The target genes include FPN1, GSH as well as SLC7A11 that encode xCT.
Nrf2 level in the brain decreases with age, and even worse in the brains of AD
GPX4 expression was reported to be reduced in the brains of both AD mouse models and AD patients
GPX4-knockout mice were proved to have significant hippocampal neuronal loss and cognitive impairment
In addition to findings in animal models, autopsy findings revealed that GPX4 was downregulated and arachidonate 12/15lipoxygenase (ALOX15) was upregulated, and the enhanced lipid peroxidation was observed, evidenced by elevated 4hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the brains of AD patients
4-HNE has the potential to modify the proteins that involved in the antioxidant and energy metabolism, promoting Aβ deposition and fibril formation
Thus, it is evident that ferroptosis plays a key role in AD, causing neuronal loss and cognitive decline (the roles of iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis are shown in Figure
Therefore, regulating brain iron metabolism and reducing neuronal ferroptosis may be a promising treatment for AD.

TARGETING IRON DYSHOMEOSTASIS AND FERROPTOSIS TO TREAT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Iron Chelators

Deferoxamine and Deferiprone
Deferoxamine (DFO; also known as desferrioxamin) is an iron chelator that is commonly used in clinical practice.
It may be an effective treatment for AD, and animal experiments and clinical trials have been conducted on
However, DFO also caused weight and appetite loss
Animal experiments involving the systemic administration of DFO to treat AD are rare, and whether DFO can cross the BBB has not yet been conclusively established.
However, some studies have found that DFO crosses the BBB less efficiently than other iron chelators
Nasal administration of DFO has been found to reduce Aβ deposition and cognitive dysfunction in AD models
However, nasal administration can cause gastrointestinal deposition of DFO, and there is inadequate penetration through the nasal mucosa thus low bioavailability
Nasal administration of DFO nanoparticles may be a safer and effective way to treat AD
This is currently being studied and may be used for treating AD in the near future.
Deferiprone (DFP) is a chelator that could be absorbed orally and cross BBB
In a randomized controlled trial, DFP improved neurological scores and iron-related neurological symptoms
DFP is currently being investigated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, and multicentral phase II trial involving patients with mild cognitive impairment, prodromal AD or mild AD, who should have sedimentary Aβ confirmed by PET scan (NCT03234686).
Giving Iron is uptaken by neurons via holo-Tf/TfR1 complex or DMT1/PrPC-dependent manners.
PrPC reduce Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ and DMT1 transport Fe 2+ into neurons.
Tf carrying Fe 3+ forms a complex with TfR1, and enters neurons via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Fe 3+ detaches from Tf and then is reduced by STEAP3.
Fe 2+ is pumped to cytoplasm by DMT1, and is stored in ferritin in the form of Fe 3+ when overload.
In some conditions, ferritin undergoes autophagy by binding with NCOA4, releasing iron and subsequently leading to lethal iron levels and ferroptosis.
Elevated irons could be excreted by FPN1/Cp or FPN1/Heph, with the assistance of APP, which is transported to stabilize FPN1 by soluble tau protein.
Aging, inflammation, and oxidative stress could dysregulate the iron transport proteins and cause iron retention.
When overload, iron could upregulates the expressions of ferritin, FPN1, and APP by IRP-IRE interactions, while suppresses the normal function of furin, leading to the upregulation of β-secretase and thus accelerating Aβ deposition.
When xCT or GSH decreases in the neurons under some states, the decreased GPX4 cannot exert the function of anti-lipid peroxidation.
After Fenton reaction or ALOX-catalyzed process, PUFA-OOH can accumulate to a lethal level to trigger ferroptosis, which could be responsible for the tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ formation and neuronal loss.
the safety and lower systemic toxicities, DFP is a viable strategy to treat AD against iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis.

Clioquinol and Its Derivatives
Clioquinol and its derivatives, which chelate iron, zinc, and copper, have also been shown to improve cognitive ability, reduce Aβ deposition, and/or promote Aβ degradation in AD animal models
This may be related to their capture of iron from Aβ and prevention of Aβ aggregation
It has also been found that clioquinol downregulates βand γ-secretase and APP expression in the brain
In vitro experiment demonstrated that clioquinol was able to degrade oligomerized tau and reduce tau tangles
The effect of clioquinol in AD was also validated in a randomized controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe AD, as oral clioquinol compared to placebo led to slower cognitive decline and reduced CSF Aβ42
There is a derivative of clioquinol that have been studied extensively named PBT2
PBT2 has the effect to promote Aβ degradation
A phase IIa, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed satisfactory safety and tolerability of PBT2 in AD, with the significant reduction in CSF Aβ42 concentration and improvement in cognition
Because of the potential of clioquinol in treating AD, some derivatives or hybrids were synthesized to treat AD, and were proved effective both in vitro and in vivo
Clioquinol and its derivatives or hybrids were demonstrated to treat AD in the above studies ascribed to their chelation properties for zinc and copper.
Other studies indicated clioquinol was also capable of preventing the loss of substantia nigra cells in the Parkinsonian transgenic mouse model because of its ability to chelate iron
Further studies on clioquinol to chelate iron in the treatment of AD need to be conducted in the future.
Giving the roles of the three metals in AD, clioquinol chelating three of them should performed better in the treatment of AD.
Because of the comparably less side-effects, clioquinol seems more promising than DFO for treating AD.

Antioxidants

Vitamin E
Antioxidants have been widely used to treat AD, and many of them can inhibit lipid peroxidation and thus ferroptosis.
Vitamin E has been found to reduce lipid peroxidation in the brains of GPX4-knockout mice, mitigate the ferroptosic morphology of neurons, and improve the cognitive function of the mice.
However, vitamin E didn't show any benefit in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment in a randomized clinical trial
Moreover, another clinical trial found that vitamin E treatment accelerated cognitive decline compared to placebo
Therefore, the use of vitamin E in AD remains questionable and more clinical trials are needed to ascertain its effect.

Alpha-Lipoic Acid
Alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) is an antioxidant with benefits for AD.
In a clinical study of 129 patients with possible AD, α-LA slowed cognitive decline and reduced cognitive impairment
α-LA relieved tau hyperphosphorylation in P301S tau transgenic mice, and it also blocked tau-induced iron overload, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation
As no serious side effects of α-LA have been observed so far, α-LA may be useful for developing treatments for AD.

Selenium
Selenium (Se) is present in a variety of proteins in the body, such as GPX4, and it has antioxidant activity.
Research have found that decreased Se in the brain of AD patients may be associated with AD progression
Primary neuron culture indicated that Se might reduce Aβ production by reducing 4-HNE-induced β-secretase transcription, thereby preventing Aβ-mediated toxicity
Se -containing compounds may inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating GPX4.
A clinical trial of 40 AD patients found that, on average, oral sodium selenate effectively supplemented brain Se levels without significant side effects, and among those who responded (i.e., had improved brain selenium levels), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score did not significantly deteriorate over time
However,
In summary, the current knowledge provides no valid evidence for a beneficial role of Se in the treatment of AD, and clinical trials are still needed to provide definitive answers.

Ferrostatin-1
Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a radical scavenger, is a common ferroptosis inhibitor much more efficiently than phenolic antioxidants
It has been demonstrated to inhibit oxidative lipid damage and cell death in diverse disease models, including Huntington's disease, periventricular leukomalacia, kidney dysfunction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiomyopathy
Fer-1 was able to alleviate angiotensin II -induced inflammation and ferroptosis in astrocytes by suppressing the ROS levels and downregulating Nrf2 and GPX4
In the treatment of AD, Fer-1 was evidenced to ameliorate neuronal death and memory impairment both in vitro and in vivo
After traumatic brain injury, the mice administrated Fer-1 was shown significantly reduced iron deposition and neuronal degeneration in the brains as well as improved long-term motor and cognitive function
Although in vivo and in vitro studies have proved the pronounced effect of Fer-1 in ameliorating oxidative stress and preventing ferroptosis, there is still no clinical trials as yet.
Its exact efficacy in AD needs to be further excavated as well as its side-effects.

Hepcidin
As hepcidin can reduce the transport of iron across the BBB and prevent iron overload in the brain, some researchers have proposed that it can treat AD, which has been confirmed in cell-based and animal experiments.
In cultured microvascular endothelial cells, hepcidin significantly inhibited FPN1, and consequently low expression of TfR1 and DMT1, as well as reduced iron uptake and iron release in neurons
In APP/PS1 mice, overexpressing hepcidin in astrocytes reduced neuronal iron level in cortex and hippocampus, where the formation of Aβ plaque were also alleviated; the mice cognitive function was elevated
Consistently, another study found that treatment with recombinant adenovirus carrying the hepcidin gene reduced iron retention and oxidative stress in the brain
These studies demonstrated the excellent potential of hepcidin in AD treatment, but hepcidin is currently only being investigated in preclinical studies.
How to deliver hepcidin to brain and its side-effects yet need to be further studied and solid evidenced.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
As the most common type of dementia, AD has become a major challenge for society and health systems because the globe population is rapidly aging.
Most clinical studies of treatments based on the mainstream hypotheses regarding AD pathogenesis have not been highly fruitful.
The gradual understanding of the roles of iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD may offer a promising direction to establish a new hypothesis, which will be of great significance and worthy to be studied deeper.
In the future, the upstream and downstream roles of iron in AD pathogenesis are yet to be elucidated, and iron quantification methods will definitely be improved with technological advances to assist the scientists better understand the iron dyshomeostasis in different brain regions.
Even though a various of molecules have been found to have the potential to alleviate iron dyshomeostasis and prevent ferroptosis, finding a way to allow these potentially useful drugs, such as iron chelators and antioxidants, to effectively cross the BBB into the brain in order to mediate their effects while avoiding systemic side effects will be the greatest challenge for future pharmacological research on AD treatment based on the potential "ferroptosis hypothesis."

Iron is uptaken by neurons via holo-Tf/TfR1 complex or DMT1/PrPC-dependent manners.
