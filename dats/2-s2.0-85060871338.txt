Introduction
The molecular signaling mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology remain elusive, hindering the development of effective treatments.
AD is characterized by profound memory loss and synaptic failure
A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that long-lasting forms of memory and synaptic plasticity require de novo protein synthesis, i.e., mRNA translation
Impaired translational capacity and ribosomal function have been observed in the brains of human AD patients, and recent studies indicate that protein synthesis impairments may contribute to cognitive defects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, prion disease, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
Protein synthesis depends in part on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which mediates the translocation step of elongation, catalyzing movement of tRNA from the ribosomal A-site to the P-site via GTP hydrolysis
Phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 by its only known kinase, eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), disrupts peptide growth and represses general protein synthesis
Abnormal hyperphosphorylation of eEF2 was observed in postmortem brain tissue from AD patients and in the brains of AD mouse models, but its link to AD-associated impairments of synaptic plasticity and memory is unknown
Here, we aimed to determine whether genetic inhibition of eEF2K/eEF2 signaling could improve protein synthesis and alleviate pathophysiology in AD model mice.

Results
eEF2 hyperphosphorylation and de novo protein synthesis impairments in Tg19959 AD model mice are corrected by genetic reduction of eEF2K.
By performing Western blot analysis on postmortem hippocampal tissue from human AD patients and age-matched controls, we found significantly increased levels of eEF2 phosphorylation at the Thr56 site (Figure
Moreover, we assayed postmortem human hippocampal tissues from patients with neuropathologically confirmed FTD and Lewy body dementia (LBD), 2 non-AD dementia syndromes (Tables
Notably, eEF2 was not hyperphosphorylated in either FTD or LBD tissues compared with their respective age-matched controls (Figure
Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of fixed postmortem brain sections from AD patients revealed increased levels of cytoplasmic phosphorylated eEFT (phospho-eEF2) throughout the AD hippocampus, including both neuronal soma and processes (Figure
Next, we crossed Tg19959 AD model mice with a line of mice lacking eEF2K (Eef2k +/-) to generate 4 genotypes: WT, Tg19959, heterozygous eEF2K +/-knockdown (eEF2K +/-), and Tg19959/eEF2K +/-double-mutant (Tg/ eEF2K +/-) mice (Figure
Both male and female mice aged 6 to 9 months were used for experimentation.
As expected, Tg19959 mice showed significantly more eEF2 phosphorylation in hippocampal lysates than WT littermates (Figure
Compared with that of Tg19959 mice, eEF2 phosphorylation in hippocampal lysates of Tg19959/eEF2K +/-mice was restored to WT levels (Figure
The eEF2K reduction did not affect gross morphology of the hippocampus, nor did it impact total levels of eEF2 (Supplemental Figure
In addition, expression of the structural components of protein Molecular signaling mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear.
Maintenance of memory and synaptic plasticity depend on de novo protein synthesis, dysregulation of which is implicated in AD.
Recent studies showed ADassociated hyperphosphorylation of mRNA translation factor eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which results in inhibition of protein synthesis.
We tested to determine whether suppression of eEF2 phosphorylation could improve protein synthesis capacity and AD-associated cognitive and synaptic impairments.
Genetic reduction of the eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) in 2 AD mouse models suppressed AD-associated eEF2 hyperphosphorylation and improved memory deficits and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments without altering brain amyloid β (Aβ) pathology.
Furthermore, eEF2K reduction alleviated ADassociated defects in dendritic spine morphology, postsynaptic density formation, de novo protein synthesis, and dendritic polyribosome assembly.
Our results link eEF2K/eEF2 signaling dysregulation to AD pathophysiology and therefore offer a feasible therapeutic target.

Dirk Keene, 2  Alexey G. Ryazanov, 3 and Tao Ma eEF2K reduction alleviates cognitive deficits in Tg19959 AD model mice.
To determine whether genetic reduction of eEF2K could alleviate AD-associated cognitive impairments, we subjected Tg19959 mice to a series of behavioral tasks.
We first performed the open-field (OF) test to assess general locomotor activity and anxiety and did not observe any differences among the 4 genotypes (Supplemental Figure
Next, we used the novel object recognition (NOR) test to assess the animals' working memory ability
Both WT and eEF2K +/-mice exhibited preference for the novel object over the familiar object on the test day, as indicated by significantly more interaction with the novel object (Figure
Tg19959 AD model animals, on the other hand, phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the known phosphatase for eEF2, was not affected across the 4 genotypes (Supplemental Figure
We further investigated the effects of eEF2K reduction on de novo protein synthesis by using surface sensing of translation (SUnSET), a nonradioactive puromycin end-labeling assay
Consistent with previous studies, hippocampal de novo protein synthesis (indicated by puromycin labeling) was significantly reduced in Tg19959 mice compared with WT (Figure
In contrast, protein synthesis levels were significantly improved in Tg19959/eEF2K mice compared with Tg19959 mice, which is consistent with suppression of eEF2 phosphorylation (Figure
While WT and eEF2K +/-mice showed robust, sustained hippocampal LTP over 90 minutes, Tg19959 mice exhibited LTP deficits (Figure
Importantly, genetic reduction of eEF2K attenuated LTP impairments in Tg19959 mice (Figure
To determine whether LTP rescue in the Tg19959/eEF2K +/-mice depended on protein synthesis, we performed LTP experiments in the presence of anisomycin (40 μM), a general mRNA translation inhibitor
WT slices treated with anisomycin exhibited LTP failure compared with vehicle-treated slices (Figure
LTP in Tg19959/eEF2K +/-slices was also inhibited by anisomycin treatment, indicating that eEF2K reduction rescued LTP in Tg19959 mice via a protein synthesisdependent mechanism (Figure
Interestingly, genetic eEF2K depletion did not significantly alter hippocampal LTP in younger Tg19959 mice (4 to 5 months), corroborating recent reports that eEF2K hyperactivity affects AD model animals with age (Supplemental Figure
We next investigated potential mechanisms through which eEF2K reduction might confer protective effects on Tg19959 mice.
We first examined amyloid β (Aβ) pathology and found similar Aβ plaque deposition in the hippocampal and cortical brain areas of Tg19959 and Tg19959/eEF2K +/-mice (Figure
We then used ELISA to determine whether eEF2K reduction affected brain levels of Aβ 1-42 or Aβ 1-40 and found no differences between Tg19959 and Tg19959/eEF2K +/-mice (Figure
Furthermore, eEF2K reduction did not affect the expression of key APP processing enzymes in Tg19959 mice, including β-secretase 1 spent roughly equal amounts of time with the familiar and novel objects, indicating a cognitive impairment (Figure
In contrast, Tg19959 mice with reduced eEF2K expression showed performance similar to that of WT mice, spending significantly more time with novel than with familiar objects (Figure
We next evaluated spatial learning and memory by testing mice on the object location memory (OLM) and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks
In the OLM task, both WT and eEF2K +/-mice exhibited normal cognition and spent more time exploring objects at the new location than the old location.
Tg19959 mice, however, failed to recognize the relocated object and spent equal amounts of time with both objects, indicating a cognitive deficit (Figure
Notably, Tg19959/eEF2K +/-mice showed a preference for objects in the new location, suggesting normal cognition (Figure
In agreement with these findings, results from the MWM task showed learning and memory impairments in Tg19959 mice that were improved with eEF2K inhibition (Figure
In addition, we tested mice on a visible platform task to assess memory-independent effects associated with eEF2K suppression, such as vision and swimming ability
Latency to locate the platform was not significantly different between Tg19959 and Tg19959/eEF2K +/-mice (Supplemental Figure
Taking these data together, suppression of eEF2K alleviated cognitive impairments in Tg19959 mice.
Suppression of eEF2K improves LTP impairments in Tg19959 AD model mice.
AD is characterized by synaptic failure
We investigated whether eEF2K suppression could prevent AD-associated impairments of long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form  tein synthesis (Figure
Protein incorporation assays and polysome profiling both show reduced translational capacity in the brains of human AD patients
Polyribosomes are clusters of ribosomes engaged in active, ongoing translation; increased polyribosome count implies greater translational capacity and has been associated with synaptic plasticity and memory formation
We utilized transmission EM (TEM) to investigate whether suppression of eEF2 phosphorylation via eEF2K reduction affected polyribosomes in area CA1 of the hippocampus.
Compared with WT, Tg19959 mice exhibited fewer dendritic polyribosomes, indicating impaired mRNA translation.
Notably, genetic reduction of eEF2K improved dendritic polyribosome deficiency in Tg19959 mice (Figure
Interestingly, polyribosome assembly was unaltered in eEF2K +/-mice (Figure
These findings are consistent with our SUnSET data (Figure
We further performed mass spectrometrybased (MS-based) proteomic experiments to assess alterations of protein profiling.
In brief, proteins upregulated by genetic eEF2K reduction were central to synaptic function, calcium buffering, mitochondrial function, and ATP generation (Figure
Reduced eEF2K expression downregulated certain cytoskeletal proteins, calcium signaling, plasma membrane dynamics, RNA binding, protein folding, and nitric oxide generation (Figure
Ten proteins in total were significantly changed in Tg19959 compared with WT mice and normalized with eEF2K reduction.
These included proteins involved in Ca 2+ signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, mitochondrial function and ATP biosynthesis, and synaptic function (Tables
Suppression of eEF2K corrects defects in APP/PS1 AD model mice.
We further replicated our findings in APP/PS1 mice, another established rodent model of AD
We crossed APP/PS1 mice with heterozygous Eef2k +/-mice to generate WT, APP/PS1, eEF2K +/-knockdown, and APP/PS1/eEF2K +/-double-mutant littermates.
Like Tg19959 mice, the APP/PS1 animals exhibited hippocampal eEF2 hyperphosphorylation that was corrected by eEF2K reduction independently of total eEF2 levels (Figure
To validate the effects of eEF2K knockdown on hippocampaldependent long-term memory formation in AD model mice, 10-to 12-month-old male and female WT, APP/PS1, eEF2K +/-, and APP/ PS1/eEF2K +/-mice were subjected to the NOR and OLM tasks.
Performance of APP/PS1 mice was impaired in both paradigms.
In the NOR task, APP/PS1 mice failed to discriminate object novelty (Figure
Similarly, APP/PS1 mice did not distinguish between object locations in the OLM task (Figure
In contrast, APP/PS1/ eEF2K +/-mice exhibited normal cognition in both behavioral paradigms (Figure
We further evaluated synaptic plasticity in these animals by inducing LTP in hippocampal slices.
APP/PS1 slices exhibited LTP failure that was alleviated with genetic eEF2K knockdown (Figure
Finally, brain levels of both Aβ 1-42 and 1-40 peptides were not significantly altered in APP/PS1 mice with genetic reduction of eEF2K (Figure
More-(BACE1) or γ-secretase subunits (Supplemental Figure
Expression of a key Aβ degrading enzyme, neprilysin, was also unaltered with eEF2K inhibition (Supplemental Figure
Together, these results indicate that eEF2K reduction improved long-term memory formation and synaptic plasticity in AD model mice independently of Aβ pathology.
Genetic reduction of eEF2K modulates spine density and morphology in AD model mice.
Regulation of dendritic spine morphology is indicative of synaptic integrity and is closely associated with neural plasticity and memory formation
Synapse loss correlates robustly with memory impairments in human AD patients and AD animal models
Furthermore, de novo protein synthesis can affect spine density, morphology, and synapse strength
Using the rapid Golgi-Cox staining protocol
Overall dendritic spine density in Tg19959 AD mice was significantly lower compared with that in WT controls and was restored by genetic reduction of eEF2K (Figure
We further analyzed changes in spine morphology based on published guidelines (Supplemental Figure
We found that the density of "mature" spines (mushroom, stubby, branched) in Tg19955 mice was decreased compared with that in WT controls.
Notably, mature spine morphology in Tg19959/ eEF2K +/-mice was restored to WT levels (Figure
No differences were observed for overall "immature" spines (thin and filopodial) across all groups (Figure
Of note, the density of filopodial spines was significantly increased in Tg19959 mice; this was blunted by eEF2K suppression (Supplemental Figure
Furthermore, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine postsynaptic densities (PSDs), which are located at the heads of spines and critical for synaptic function
Ultrastructural analysis of hippocampal area CA1 revealed decreased PSD density in Tg19959 mice, which was restored to WT levels by suppression of eEF2K (Figure
Taking these data together, genetic suppression of eEF2K prevented defects in hippocampal spine density/morphology and PSD formation in Tg19959 AD model mice.
These data are consistent with the results from our behavioral and electrophysiological studies (Figure
Genetic reduction of eEF2K upregulates protein synthesis capacity in AD model mice.
We showed that resistance to LTP failure in Tg19959/eEF2K +/-hippocampal slices depended on de novo pro-  over, brain levels of p-tau were similar between APP/PS1 and APP/ PS1/eEF2K +/-mice (Supplemental Figure
These findings are consistent with the results from the Tg19959 mouse experiments described above, indicating that genetic suppression of eEF2K activity, and thus eEF2 phosphorylation, prevents AD-associated cognitive impairments and synaptic plasticity failure.

Discussion
Present disease-modifying strategies in AD clinical trials have met with limited success, and it is urgent to identify alternative therapeutic avenues based on solid mechanistic studies.
Here, we report that genetic reduction of eEF2K alleviated memory impairments and synaptic failure in 2 separate lines of AD model mice, raising the possibility that targeting the eEF2K/eEF2 signaling pathway could protect against AD and other cognitive syndromes associated with dysregulated protein synthesis.
Our findings are consistent with recent studies showing AD-associated hyperactivity of AMPK, a molecular energy sensor that activates eEF2K via phosphorylation in response to low energy states
AD is characterized by oxidative stress and energy metabolism defi- ciency
Phosphorylation of eEF2 by eEF2K (controlled by AMPK) inhibits general protein synthesis, which is a protective strategy under physiological conditions for cells to cope with stress, since decreased mRNA translation helps cells conserve energy and enhance the expression of stress-related proteins
It was also reported that eEF2K activation promotes survival of tumor cells under conditions of nutrient deprivation
Nevertheless, severe and prolonged cellular stress under pathological conditions, such as AD, results in long-term and irreversible mRNA translation suppression, which is detrimental because de novo protein synthesis is critical for the maintenance of memory and synaptic plasticity
Protein synthesis takes place in 3 phases: initiation, elongation, and termination.
Much attention has been given to the initiation process, which is usually considered the rate-limiting step during de novo protein synthesis
However, low cellular mRNA translational capacity in neuronal dendrites would require upregulation of both initiation and elongation processes to meet the substantial need of new protein synthesis associated with maintenance of memory and synaptic plasticity
The mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signaling cascades are critical for regulation of translation initiation in protein synthesis-dependent forms of memory and synaptic plasticity
mTORC1 also controls translation elongation by inhibiting eEF2K and thus eEF2 phosphorylation either directly or through its downstream effector S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)
Further, we previously reported increased phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) in AD brains
Suppression of eIF2α phosphorylation corrected AD-associated cognitive and synaptic plasticity defects
Mounting evidence suggests an important role for elongation regulation in cognition, with recent studies linking dysregulation of elongation factors with AD pathophysiology
Of note, a recent study showed a connection between eIF2 signaling and eEF2 phosphorylation in neurons
While additional studies are warranted to evaluate ADassociated dysregulation of initiation and elongation separately, there is evidence for crosstalk between these 2 phases of translation via eIF2 and eEF2.
How this relationship is affected in AD remains to be elucidated.
Unlike initiation, however, elongation may offer more promising therapeutic strategies for dementia treatment.
The only known substrate for eEF2K is eEF2, and this specificity makes it an attractive target for AD therapy in avoiding off-target effects.
Further, there are several available selective eEF2K antagonists, and future studies are important to determine whether these inhibitors are effective in alleviating cognition defects in AD
Moreover, our proteomics study showed that eEF2K reduction in AD model mice restored protein levels of calbindin, a Ca 2+ -buffering molecule, and reduced levels of the L-type Ca 2+ channel modulator NIPSNAP2
These results suggest a feedback loop between Ca 2+ levels and eEF2K/eEF2 signaling, providing an additional mechanistic explanation for improvements of AD-associated cognitive and plasticity impairments by eEF2K suppression.
It is worth mentioning that hippocampal eEF2K phosphorylation was increased in AD, but not in FTD or LBD, brain samples (Figure
AD cases in this study were characterized by high levels of hippocampal phosphorylated τ (neurofibrillary tangles) and Aβ (plaques).
FTD cases (all patients reported here were diagnosed The eEF2/eEF2K signaling pathway is implicated in memory formation and synaptic function.
A recent study showed that synaptic activity could modulate spine morphology via eEF2K activity.
Repression of eEF2K activity impaired spine formation and dendritic BDNF release
This work seemingly contradicts our own, as we found eEF2K knockdown enhanced dendritic spine density and maturity in Tg19959 AD model mice (Figure
There are a number of important differences between the 2 studies, including the model system (cultured neurons from rats vs. aged mice) and approaches (siRNA vs. knockout mice).
Interestingly, we did observe significantly fewer stubby spines in the heterozygous eEF2K +/-dendrites compared with WT (Supplemental Figure
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the eEF2/ eEF2K pathway serves as a molecular sensor of synaptic stimulation that modulates the homeostatic conditions of the neuron (51).
Our findings demonstrate the importance of this homeostatic balance, revealing the detrimental effects of either overactivation or underactivation of eEF2K on synapse morphology.
eEF2K is also known as Ca 2+ / calmodulin-dependent kinase III (CaMKIII) because it is activated by Ca 2+ /calmodulin
Aberrant Ca 2+ homeostasis is linked to AD pathogenesis

APP/PS1 mice were crossbred with Eef2k +/-mice to generate littermate groups (C57BL/6): WT, APP/PS1, eEF2K +/-, and APP/PS1/eEF2K +/- double-mutant mice (APP/eEF2K +/-).
All genotyping was determined by PCR.
Tg19959 cohorts underwent all experimental protocols at 6 to 9 months of age, while APP/PS1 cohorts were evaluated at 10 to 12 months of age
To assess hippocampal synaptic plasticity at a younger age, Tg19959 cohorts were subjected to electrophysiological experiments for measurement of LTP at 4 to 5 months of age.
OF assay.
Mice were handled for at least 5 days prior to behavioral testing and habituated to the testing facility for an hour prior to experimentation.
Animals were placed in an opaque plastic OF chamber (40 cm × 40 cm × 40cm) and allowed to explore for 15 minutes.
Time spent in the center and periphery of the chamber was measured and calculated as a percentage of total time.
Distance moved and velocity were measured using EthoVision XT Tracking Software (Noldus Information Technology).
Data collection and analysis were performed blinded.
NOR. Mice underwent a 2-day familiarization protocol in which they were placed in an opaque, plastic arena (40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) with 2 identical objects and allowed to explore for 5 minutes.
Twenty-four hours after familiarization, animals were tested in the arena for 5 minutes with one object replaced with a novel object.
All objects were randomly assigned to mice, and placement of novel objects was counterbalanced.
Time spent with each object was measured and calculated as a percentage of the total interaction time.
Novel object preference of less than 50% indicates memory impairment
Time with objects was measured both manually and using EthoVision 7 tracking software.
Mice with a total interaction time of less than 10 seconds were excluded from analysis.
Data collection and analysis were performed blinded.
OLM task.
Mice were habituated to an opaque, plastic chamber (40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) with visible spatial cues for 10 minutes.
After 24 hours, mice were returned to the chamber with 2 identical objects placed in the arena and allowed to freely explore for 10 minutes.
Twentyfour hours later, mice were again returned to the chamber with one object moved to the opposite side of the arena.
Objects and changes in object location were randomly determined and counterbalanced.
Time spent with each object was measured and calculated as a percentage of the total interaction time.
Novel object preference of less than 50% indicates memory impairment
Time with objects was measured both manually and using EthoVision XT tracking software.
Mice with a total interaction time of less than 10 seconds were excluded from analysis.
Data collection and analysis were performed blinded.
MWM. MWM was performed as previously described
The paradigm consisted of 4 trials (60-second maximum, 15-minute interval) per day for 5 consecutive days.

A probe trial was performed 2 hours following training on the fifth day.
The visible platform task consisted of 4 trials per day for 2 consecutive days, with the escape platform marked by a visible cue and moved with progressive supranuclear palsy) typically have significant hippocampal τ phosphorylation (p-tau), while LBD cases are burdened by hippocampal α-synuclein and lack substantial levels of p-tau
Moreover, both FTD and LBD cases lack significant hippocampal Aβ deposition
Our findings suggests that eEF2 hyperphosphorylation may be specific to AD-related pathological processes, such as Aβ or AD-type p-tau, and not related to frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (FTLD-tau), α-synuclein, or nonspecific neurodegenerative disease processes that span a diverse array of conditions.
Interestingly, we did observe a significant decrease in hippocampal eEF2 phosphorylation in FTD patients (Figure
Future studies are needed to evaluate the specificity of eEF2 hyperphosphorylation to the pathologic changes in AD and other dementia syndromes.
In summary, our work demonstrates that eEF2K reduction rescues long-term memory and synaptic plasticity deficits in AD model mice.
Genetic reduction of eEF2K influenced memory and plasticity-related mechanisms, including spine density, and upregulation of de novo protein synthesis.
Thus, the eEF2/eEF2K pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for future AD interventions.
