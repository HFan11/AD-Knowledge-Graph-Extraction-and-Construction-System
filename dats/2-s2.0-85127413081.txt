Endogenous and Exogenous Estrogen Exposures: How Women’s Reproductive Health Can Drive Brain Aging and Inform Alzheimer’s Prevention
After advanced age, female sex is the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia affecting over 24 million people worldwide.
The prevalence of AD is higher in women than in men, with postmenopausal women accounting for over 60% of all those affected.
While most research has focused on gender-combined risk, emerging data indicate sex and gender differences in AD pathophysiology, onset, and progression, which may help account for the higher prevalence in women.
Notably, AD-related brain changes develop during a 10-20 year prodromal phase originating in midlife, thus proximate with the hormonal transitions of endocrine aging characteristic of the menopause transition in women.
Preclinical evidence for neuroprotective effects of gonadal sex steroid hormones, especially 17β-estradiol, strongly argue for associations between female fertility, reproductive history, and AD risk.
The level of gonadal hormones to which the female brain is exposed changes considerably across the lifespan, with relevance to AD risk.
However, the neurobiological consequences of hormonal fluctuations, as well as that of hormone therapies, are yet to be fully understood.
Epidemiological studies have yielded contrasting results of protective, deleterious and null effects of estrogen exposure on dementia risk.
In contrast, brain imaging studies provide encouraging evidence for positive associations between greater cumulative lifetime estrogen exposure and lower AD risk in women, whereas estrogen deprivation is associated with negative consequences on brain structure, function, and biochemistry.
Herein, we review the existing literature and evaluate the strength of observed associations between femalespecific reproductive health factors and AD risk in women, with a focus on the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposures as a key underlying mechanism.
Chief among these variables are reproductive lifespan, menopause status, type of menopause (spontaneous vs. induced), number of pregnancies, and exposure to hormonal therapy,

INTRODUCTION Alzheimer's Disease and the Importance of Being Female
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in Western societies, affecting over 24 million patients worldwide
Today, AD remains the only major cause of mortality without an effective disease-modifying treatment.
Given lack of therapeutics to prevent, delay or reverse late-onset AD, the number of persons living with AD dementia is projected to nearly triple by 2050
The limited success of disease-modifying trials is likely due to testing of potential therapeutic agents too late in disease course, and to an incomplete understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD
These shortcomings are attributable, at least in part, to the fact that most research has ignored the existence of biological sex differences in AD and focused on sex-aggregated risk.
Given increasing evidence that AD prevalence, symptomatology, and risk profiles vary by sex
Female sex is the second most significant risk factor for AD after advanced age
AD affects more women than men, with a nearly 2:1 ratio in many countries (Alzheimer's Association, 2021), and with postmenopausal women accounting for over 60% of all those affected
This disparity may be a consequence of women's relatively longer life expectancy
However, evidence against this hypothesis stems from multiple sources indicating a greater age-adjusted risk of AD in women independent of survival rates
Women are also more likely to develop amnestic MCI, often a prodromal stage to AD dementia
Sex differences in cognitive functions affected by AD have also been documented, as men tend to have higher visuospatial and motor coordination scores than women
There is concern that the female advantage on memory testing might mask AD-related brain changes, resulting in women being diagnosed at a later stage than their male counterparts.
Support to this hypothesis comes from AD biomarker studies, including biomarkers of AD pathology, such as Aβ accumulation on PET imaging and in CSF; biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including biomarkers of neuronal injury and degeneration such as increased CSF tau levels and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy and gray matter (GM) volume; and biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, such as lower cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) on 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET)
Generally, Aβ biomarkers are regarded as providing the highest specificity for AD, whereas biomarkers of neurodegeneration are not specific to AD but show higher sensitivity to AD-related changes, while also correlating with cognitive declines
Where Aβ biomarkers are specific to AD, CMRglc and GM volume are indirect measurements of synaptic and neuronal loss
Nonetheless, combined imaging and autopsy studies show good correlation between ante-mortem FDG-PET diagnosis and post-mortem confirmation of AD
Additionally, reductions in CMRglc and GM volume were shown to precede and correlate with declines in cognitive performance along the continuum from normal cognition to MCI to AD dementia, and predict conversion to dementia with high accuracy (de
Biomarker studies, especially by means of brain imaging techniques, indicate that female AD patients exhibit greater rates of neurodegenerative decline, as evidenced by increased hippocampal atrophy and greater neurofibrillary tangle burden, relative to male AD patients with the same level of brain amyloidβ (Aβ) load, with no difference in lifetime AD risk
Non-demented elderly women with biomarker-determined Aβ positivity also show more rapid hippocampal volume loss than men with similar pathological burden
As reviewed below, cognitively normal midlife women at risk for AD (e.g., family history of late-onset AD and/or heterozygous or homozygous for APOE-4 allele) exhibit increased indicators of AD risk as compared to age-controlled men, including higher Aβ load, lower CMRglc, and lower GM and white matter (WM) volume
Sex differences in the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, have also been documented.
The APOE-4 allele has been associated with a younger age at AD onset, and increased Aβ deposition, with greatest risk observed in those carrying two alleles (for recent review, see
Female APOE-4 carriers are more likely than male carriers to develop AD, with a nearly 4-and 10-fold in women with one and two APOE-4 alleles, respectively, whereas men exhibit essentially little increased risk with one APOE-4 allele and a fourfold increased risk with two APOE-4 alleles
Women carrying the APOE-4 genotype also exhibit higher Aβ deposition
Overall, while age and lifespan certainly play a role, there is increasing recognition that female sex, along with additional genetic, social, and lifestyle factors, is an important risk factor for AD
These observations have spurred renewed interest in investigating sex differences in the biological mechanisms underlying AD.
Identifying endophenotypes of AD risk that emerge early in the course of the disease and that differ by sex is vital to clarify the mechanistic pathways linking female-specific physiological processes to AD, and to identify sex-specific targets for risk reduction and therapeutic development.

From Bedside to Bench
The pathophysiological process of AD, including accumulation of Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, begins 10-20 years prior to clinically detectable symptoms
Therefore, the prodromal period starts as early as midlife, which coincides with the hormonal transitions of endocrine aging characteristic of the menopause transition in women
The menopause transition is a complex neuro-endocrine transitional state marked by changes in gonadal sex steroid hormones, especially 17β-estradiol, following progressive oocyte depletion.
While menopause is primarily associated with reproductive senescence, it has wide ranging neurological consequences including changes in thermoregulation manifesting as hot flashes, circadian rhythm disruption manifesting as sleep disturbances, mood changes, as well as memory and attention complaints
Many of these symptoms are risk factors for AD in turn
The emergence of multiple AD risks in midlife, both at the neurophysiological level and at the clinical symptomatic level, are consistent with menopause being a tipping point for AD risk in later life
A burgeoning array of preclinical studies has provided evidence for neuroprotective effects of estrogens, and identified life-time estrogen exposure as a modulator of cognitive aging in females
Translational neuroimaging studies of midlife women revealed emergence of AD endophenotypes, including greater Aβ burden, glucose hypometabolism, and gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume loss, during the menopause transition
Women undergoing surgically induced menopause due to salpingo-oophorectomies also exhibit increased neuropathology and imaging biomarker indicators of AD
This suggests that estrogen deprivation following menopause may trigger or exacerbate a pre-existing disposition for AD
Even before menopause, the level of gonadal hormones to which the female brain is exposed changes considerably across the lifespan.
Estrogen levels in women can fluctuate widely during reproductive events, and in response to both endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposures
Endogenous levels of estrogen vary based on several factors, including menopause status, age at menarche, age at menopause, the reproductive window, number of pregnancies and children, and gynecological surgeries.
Exogenous levels of estrogen vary chiefly due to use of hormonal contraceptives (HC), menopause hormonal therapy (HT), and anti-estrogen therapies for neoplastic conditions such as ovarian and breast cancers.
Gender-affirming therapy can also include hormone treatment
Brain modifications resulting from reproductive health history events as related to estrogen exposure and their implications for cognitive aging and AD risk are the focus of this review.
Herein, we evaluate the existing literature and assess the strength of observed associations between reproductive history factors and AD, with a focus on the role of estrogen exposure as an underlying mechanism.
We conducted a literature search on the PubMed Medline and Web of Science databases for papers (excluding case-reports) published between the years 1985 and 2021, in English language, using search terms for exposures ["estrogen", "hormones", "menopause", "perimenopause", "menopause transition", "reproductive history", "reproductive span", "menarche", "parity", "children", "pregnancies"] and for outcomes ["Alzheimer's disease", "dementia", "cognition", "cognitive performance"] in the title or abstract.
We also provided a general overview of hormonal treatments' effects on AD risk.
Knowledge of reproductive history effects on AD risk is critical to informing clinicians on management of modifiable factors for cognitive decline and for development of therapeutic targets that modify estrogenic risk factors.

ESTROGEN FUNCTION IN BRAIN
Besides their obvious role in reproduction, sex hormones are known regulators of neuronal morphology, number, and function, which makes endocrine aging an important contributor to brain aging
The transition to menopause is marked by radical changes in the production and activity of sex steroid hormones in the body and brain
As such, changes in gonadal hormones, primarily 17β-estradiol, the most potent form of estrogen and the primary circulating hormone during a woman's reproductive years, have been proposed as major contributors to the higher risk of AD in women
Estrogen is synthesized primarily in the ovaries, where it regulates the menstrual cycle.
However, it is also synthesized in several non-reproductive tissues, including brain, liver, and adipose fat
While peripheral estrogen can cross the blood brain barrier and act on central estrogen receptors located on neurons and glia, much of the estrogen present in brain is synthesized locally
During development, adult life, and aging, estradiol exerts multiple regulatory actions in the central nervous system (CNS), which are mediated by direct effects on neurons and glial cells.
Estrogenic input on neurons influences higher cognitive function, pain, fine motor skills, mood, susceptibility to seizures, and neuroprotection in response to brain damage
On glial cells, including oligodendroglia, astroglia, and microglia, estrogen is crucial for regulation of neuronal metabolism and activity as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity
Estrogen signaling in the brain activates multiple functions through a network of receptors expressed in select cellular populations
There are two broad classes of estrogen receptors: classical nuclear receptors, composed of alpha and beta subtypes (ERα and ERβ), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptors (GPER).
ERα and ERβ are ligandactivated transcription factors that dimerize and translocate to the nucleus after ligand binding
Once in the nucleus, they bind to estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoters of target genes to regulate transcription and gene expression
Membrane receptor GPERs also regulate transcription of target genes, but through indirect means via MAPK and PI3K activation and cAMP production
The chief distinction is that ERα and ERβ lead to transcription of late response genes while GPER mediate many of the rapid responses of estradiol by means of fast signaling transcriptional activation.
All types of estrogen receptors are selectively distributed throughout the brain and occur in specific nuclei and cell types.
ERα and ERβ are co-expressed in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus
However, ERα is predominant in hypothalamic nuclei that control reproduction, sexual behavior, and appetite
While ERα and ERβ both contribute to the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, ERβ plays a larger role than ERα in supporting cognition by mediating neural plasticity, regulating brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and promoting learning and memory
GPER receptors are also widely distributed in brain, and most concentrated in hippocampus and amygdala
There is vast preclinical literature documenting that estradiol is neuroprotective and neurotrophic, with anti-inflammatory and vasodilating effects, especially in brain regions responsible for higher-order cognitive functions, including hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum
Estrogen is a "systems biology regulator" (e.g., a factor that regulates the frequency, rate or extent of interrelated biological processes) of neuronal function and survival, supporting neuronal plasticity through genomic and non-genomic actions
In adult female rats, synaptic density of hippocampal neurons in the CA1 region were correlated with estradiol during the 5-day estrous cycle, demonstrating that fluctuations in estradiol levels directly mediate short-term synaptic density
Further, mechanistic analyses led to the discovery that estrogen functions as a master regulator of the brain bioenergetic system, acting as a critical signaling molecule involved in glucose uptake and metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP generation
Since glucose is the primary physiological substrate for ATP generation in the brain, energy production is at risk if reduction in glucose metabolism occurs.
Several lines of research show that estrogen plays a major role in regulating several mitochondrial pathways, and that loss of estrogen precipitates mitochondrial dysfunction
Further, estrogen promotes aerobic glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (TCA) by increasing the activity of glycolytic and TCA enzymes
As a result, the menopausal transition in female animals is marked by a bioenergetic deficit characterized by downregulation of glucose metabolic pathways, in particular glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), pyruvate dehydrogenase 1 (PDH1), and oxidative phosphorylation
Concomitant reductions in CMRglc as detected by FDG-PET are apparent in clinical analyses of oophorectomized women as well as those undergoing spontaneous menopause
Glucose metabolic decline in brain is also found during the prodromal phase of AD
Collectively, these studies implicate a shift in the bioenergetic system of the brain during the menopause transition as a trigger for Aβ deposition, along with increased fatty acid catabolism, and declines in mitochondrial activity and synaptic plasticity
These data are consistent with evidence that 17β-estradiol promotes non-amyloidogenic processing by increasing secretion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and decreasing Aβ production
Estrogen has been shown to upregulate Aβ -degradation enzymes such as metalloproteinases-2 and -9
Further, 17β-estradiol reduces levels of both induced and naturally occurring hyperphosphorylated tau protein
On the other hand, estrogen loss following oophorectomy increases inflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, accumulation of Aβ plaques and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in transgenic mouse models of AD

ENDOGENOUS ESTROGEN EXPOSURES Menopause
Physiologically, menopause represents the permanent cessation of ovulation and menstrual cycles.
It is defined retrospectively, after 12 months of amenorrhea without obvious pathologic cause.
Menopause occurs in stages
The early menopause transition is associated with lower ovarian inhibin secretion, which in turn, reduces the restraint on both the hypothalamus and pituitary, resulting in elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, while ovarian estradiol secretion is normal or at times, elevated
The late menopause transition (perimenopause) is characterized by periods of estrogen withdrawal, with fewer ovulatory cycles and prolonged hypogonadism, which ultimately lead to the final menstrual period (FMP) and a menopause diagnosis
Production of other hormones such as androgens and growth factors also decline during perimenopause
Five to 10 years after the FMP, hormonal levels become more stable with elevated gonadotropin secretion
All women go through menopause in their lives, either through a natural midlife aging process or via surgical or pharmacological intervention.
While the average lifespan has been steadily increasing over the past century, the average age at which reproductive senescence occurs has remained relatively constant between 45 and 55 years of age.
Therefore, including the prepubescent years, women live at least a third of their lives in a hypogonadism state, and that number increases to up to half for women with surgical menopause.
One in every eight women in the U.S. undergo surgical menopause in their lives
In most cases, premature menopause results from the removal of both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) before menopause, which lead to an abrupt cessation of ovarian estrogen production.
Removal of only one ovary (unilateral oophorectomy) does not cause menopause, though several studies indicate a younger age at menopause compared to women who retain both ovaries
Removal of the uterus alone (hysterectomy without oophorectomy) can reduce ovarian estrogen release by disturbing blood flow to the ovaries, thus indirectly influencing the onset of menopause.
Certain drugs and radiation therapies can also damage the ovaries and prompt menopause.
Spontaneous menopause is a normal physiological event without long-term adverse effects for the majority of women
However, as high as 80% of women are vulnerable to the neurological shifts that can occur during the transition, experiencing an increased risk of neurological and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and dementia later in life

Surgical Menopause and Alzheimer's Disease Risk
Oophorectomies are frequently performed for benign (noncancerous) diseases, most commonly for recurrent ovarian cysts, endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain and also at the time of hysterectomy for fibroids and heavy vaginal bleeding
Other common indications include removal of gynecological cancers or risk reduction treatment in women with an inherited increased chance of ovarian cancer as due to gene mutations such as BRCA1, BRCA2 or HNPCC
These procedures are considered low-risk surgeries.
However, abrupt discontinuation of ovarian function in premenopausal women is associated with more severe health consequences than spontaneous menopause, including a sudden and more severe onset of menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes and vaginal dryness, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, osteoporosis, and sexual dysfunction
Surgical menopause has also been linked to a higher risk of depression and Parkinson's disease
There is also evidence that sudden estrogen depletion following surgical menopause affects cognition and AD risk, as reviewed below and in Table
Since the late 1980s, several reports indicated memory declines in women undergoing oophorectomy before menopause, which were later substantiated by large-scale studies indicating an almost doubled long-term risk of dementia in oophorectomized women
Dementia risk is generally highest in the presence of bilateral oophorectomy, intermediate with unilateral oophorectomy, and lowest but significant in the presence of hysterectomy without oophorectomy
Bilateral oophorectomy also results in an abrupt drop in circulating levels of progesterone and testosterone, and in the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis
Additionally, pre-menopausal oophorectomies have been linked to alterations in nervous  • Surgical menopause was associated with increased amyloid plaque burden but not with AD incidence.
• HT initiated within 5 years of menopause was associated with decrease in global cognitive decline but not with AD pathology • HT had negative effects on verbal fluency performance in this cohort.
• No association with dementia risk at the 7-year follow up • No differences in cognitive scores between surgical and spontaneous menopause groups.
• Oophorectomized women exhibited smaller amygdala volume and parahippocampal-entorhinal cortex thickness, and lower fractional anisotropy vs. spontaneous menopause.
• There were no effects on hippocampal volume and PiB uptake

system innervation with wide-ranging effects on the function of the vagus nerve, autonomic nervous system, and cardiovascular system, among others
Dementia risk increases with younger age at time of surgery
Surgical menopause has been linked to more severe consequences on cognitive function than spontaneous menopause, including lower performance in verbal learning, visual memory
Decline in short-term verbal memory was more severe in women who had greater than 50% decline in serum estradiol levels following surgery
However, as discussed below, estrogen replacement therapy following surgery appears to mitigate cognitive changes when compared to placebo

Spontaneous Menopause and Alzheimer's Disease Risk
Given the importance of estrogen for brain function, it is not surprising that complaints of a decline in memory, attention and concentration are common during the menopause transition
These complaints are, however, self-reported and unlikely to result in objective, measurable impairment, thus often falling under the diagnostic category of subjective cognitive decline (SCD).
Although SCD is observed in normal aging and in some psychiatric, neurological, and medical conditions other than AD, current evidence suggests that people ages 60 and older experiencing SCD may be at higher risk for MCI and dementia
Notably, SCD is more common, and may be more predictive of later cognitive dysfunction, in women ages 65 and above
Whether menopause-related cognitive complaints can be confirmed objectively is a topic of debate
Some studies indicate measurable, yet modest declines in verbal episodic memory on delayed recall tests, or lack of improvement in verbal memory and processing speed with repeated testing
These findings were more likely restricted to the perimenopausal and early postmenopausal stages, and were independent of non-cognitive menopausal symptoms such as anxiety, disturbed sleep, and mood symptoms
In some studies, SCD in perimenopausal women was associated with changes in working memory and complex attention rather than verbal episodic learning or memory
Importantly, memory declines during perimenopause range from moderate to subtle, and performance tends to rebound to premenopausal levels after the menopause diagnosis
Overall, clinical data suggest that negative effects of menopause on cognitive performance are transient and generally limited to the perimenopausal stage.
It is unknown whether these memory fluctuations are predictive of cognitive impairment in later life.
Novel research using AD biomarkers provides important insight into the neurological effects of menopause and its effects on cognition and AD risk.
While the preponderance of biomarker studies has been carried out in women who had already transitioned through the menopause, recent investigations targeting women of perimenopausal age demonstrated significant associations between menopause and biomarker indicators of increased AD risk.
For instance, smaller medial temporal lobe volume was reported in surgical menopausal cases as compared to spontaneous menopause
Presence of night sweats was associated with a higher burden of WM hyperintensities
More direct evidence that the menopause transition is associated with AD risk comes from multi-modality brain imaging studies reporting emergence of AD endophenotypes in midlife women carrying risk factors for AD, such as APOE-4 genotype and a family history of late-onset AD (Figure
In these studies, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women exhibited higher Aβ load, lower CMRglc, and lower GM and WM volume as compared to premenopausal women and to agecontrolled men, independent of age and midlife health indicators
AD biomarker effects involved brain regions vulnerable to AD, such as posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietotemporal, medial temporal, and frontal cortices (Figure
These regions exhibit considerable overlap with the brain estrogen network
Biomarker effects correlated with menopause status being lowest premenopause, intermediate in perimenopause, and greatest postmenopause
Additionally, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, especially those positive for APOE-4 genotype, exhibited the highest Aβ burden
While menopause effects on Aβ deposition were overall mild, the earlier onset and longer exposure to Aβ pathology could help account for the higher prevalence of AD in women.
Longitudinal exams indicate that biomarker abnormalities related to the menopause transition were progressive over a 3 year period
However, some brain regions showed stabilization and in some cases, recovery later into menopause
For example, GM volumes in temporal regions and precuneus declined in perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women
Additionally, in spite of
Results are displayed on a color-coded scale with corresponding Z values, where Z > 3 corresponds to p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.
(B) LASSO regression models indicate that midlife sex differences in GM volume were driven by menopause status, followed by use of hormonal replacement therapy (HT) and hysterectomy status
Coefficients from LASSO regressions ranking multiple exposures are displayed on a color-coded scale such that coefficients >0.5 correspond to p < 0.05.
(C) Among midlife women, GM density was highest in premenopausal women (PRE), intermediate in perimenopausal women (PERI), and lowest in postmenopausal women (POST), adjusting by age and intracranial volume
(D) Brain regions undergoing GM volume changes as a result of the menopause transition exhibit substantial anatomical overlap with the brain estrogen network, including medial temporal lobe, insula, anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus, parieto-temporal and frontal cortices
Statistical parametric maps showing 3D GM volume differences between PRE, PERI and POST groups are superimposed on a standardized T1-MRI image at p < 0.05.
(E) In longitudinal studies, GM volume declined in temporal regions of postmenopausal groups (negative values), but showed recovery in precuneus (positive values)
Surface renderings display significant GM volume changes post-menopause, which are represented on a color-coded scale with corresponding Z values, where Z > 3 and Z < -3 correspond to p < 0.05.
(F) GM volume changes in precuneus correlated with memory changes among postmenopausal women
(G) GM volume is influenced by additional reproductive history events such as a longer reproductive span and exogenous estrogen exposure
Statistical parametric maps (SPM) displaying brain regions showing significant associations between longer reproductive spans and GM volume.
Effects are represented on a color-coded scale with corresponding Z values, where Z > 3 corresponds to p < 0.05.
WM volume declines, fractional anisotropy (FA), as derived using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), remained broadly stable during the menopause transition
Since FA is a marker of WM integrity and structural connectivity, these data suggest preserved connectivity of smaller WM tracts
Moreover, cerebral blood flow (CBF), as measured by means of Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), was higher in the postmenopausal group as compared to premenopausal controls and to age-controlled men, and so were ATP levels measured via 31 Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31 P-MRS)
GM volume recovery and brain ATP production post-menopause correlated with cognitive performance
On the other hand, biomarker recovery was attenuated in perimenopausal and postmenopausal APOE-4 carriers, who also exhibited the highest Aβ load
Overall, this preliminary data suggests brain adaptation to the hypo-estrogenic postmenopausal state, at least in some women, consistent with findings of system-biology adaptations in response to estrogen decline in aging female animals
This may account for the easing of menopausal symptoms observed in late postmenopausal women
Studies comparing women at high vs low risk for AD are needed to determine whether the hypothesized brain recovery is comprised in presence of an AD predisposition.

OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INDICATORS
Even before menopause, the level of estrogen in the female brain fluctuates based on several reproductive events and hormone treatments.
Reproductive history is an important modifier of lifetime estrogen exposure and likely of cognitive aging.
As reviewed below, there has been increasing interest in determining whether estrogen exposure over the female lifespan is protective against AD.
Key findings are summarized in Table

Age at Menarche
The age at which a woman enters menarche (puberty) has gained attention for a possible relationship with cognition in later life due to higher estrogen levels, and thus longer estrogen exposure, when menarche occurs at a younger age
However, as shown in Figure
On the other hand, some studies reported that a younger age at menarche was associated with better visual memory and psychomotor speed
Additionally, the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort study reported associations between a younger age at menarche and lower CSF Aβ 42/40 ratio and higher hyperphosphorylated tau levels among older postmenopausal women free of dementia

Age at Menopause
Given findings of neuroprotective effects of estrogen, it is plausible that a later age at menopause would enable longer overall exposure to estrogen, and supposedly better cognitive function.
The majority of studies so far indicate positive outcomes with a later age at menopause (Figures
As mentioned above, a younger age at surgical menopause has been linked to higher risk of AD
Although data on spontaneous menopause are less consistent, some studies also report better cognitive performance
In the Kaiser Permanente cohort, women who underwent spontaneous menopause between the ages of 31-40 and 41-45 years had a 20% and 29% increased risk of dementia, respectively, when compared to those who were aged 51-55 years at the time of menopause
On the other hand, two studies reported an increased incidence of dementia and AD with an older age at menopause for specific study populations
In the Rotterdam study, this association was found only in women carrying at least one copy of the APOE-4 allele
In the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort study, the association was only significant in women who had dementia onset after 75 years of age, with the strongest occurrence after 85 years of age
Null associations have also been reported

Reproductive Span
While both age at menarche and age at menopause mark the duration of a woman's lifetime exposure to endogenous estrogen, examination of the time in between these two events -the reproductive span -appears to be a stronger predictor of later life cognition.
Given the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, it is plausible that a longer reproductive span would be correlated with better cognitive outcomes in later life.
The length of this window has been associated with reduced risk of several diseases in postmenopause, such as cardiovascular disease and depression
However, the relationship between reproductive span and dementia risk is less clear (Table
Several studies have found that women with longer reproductive periods, especially in presence of older age at menopause, have better cognitive outcomes and lower risk of dementia or cognitive decline
In the Kaiser Permanente study, a reproductive span less than 34.4 years was associated with a 20% increased risk of dementia compared to those with a reproductive span of at least 34.4 years, and when comparing the groups of those with the shortest and longest reproductive span, 14-20 years and 39-44 years, respectively, there was a 55% increased risk of dementia associated with a shorter reproductive span
However, other studies observed no associations between reproductive span and dementia risk
In a followup analysis of the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort, longer reproductive span also correlated with lower CSF Aβ 42/40 and higher phosphorylated tau levels in a subset of postmenopausal women ages 70-85 years
The authors offer that women who undergo menopause at an older age have higher estrogen levels later in life, when AD-related pathologies arise.
This is consistent with the "healthy cell bias" theory, which postulates that while estrogen is neuroprotective in healthy cells, • Dementia patients had lower age at menopause than controls
• Women with ≥ 5 children were more likely to have dementia compared to women with 1-2 children.
• HT use was more common in controls than in dementia patients • Younger age at menarche was associated with higher visual memory and psychomotor speed.
• Women who had their first birth between ages 21-29 scored higher on verbal fluency, visual memory, and psychomotor speed tests vs. women who gave birth before age 21.
• Current HT use, but not past, was associated with higher visual memory scores vs. never users.
• No associations between contraceptive use or surgical menopause with cognitive performance or dementia incidence.

Change in cognitive performance
• Longer endogenous estrogen exposure was associated with higher modified MMSE (3MS) scores.
• Longer use of HT and initiation of HT within 5 years of menopause were associated with higher 3MS scores.
• Earlier age at menarche and longer reproductive span were associated with higher P-Tau and lower Aβ42/Aβ40.
• Longer reproductive period was associated with lower Aβ42.
• No associations between age at menopause and CSF biomarkers.  it can be neurotoxic in damaged cells
Thus, the timing of endogenous estrogen exposure likely contributes to the positive or negative impact of estrogen on neuronal health.
However, as all women in the Gothenburg study remained free of dementia despite the biomarker data, the functional significance of the associations is unclear.
In fact, these correlations may suggest a protective effect of reproductive span insteadanalogous to the way that more years of education correlate with higher AD pathology burden in non-demented elderly, which are interpreted as reflecting greater cognitive reserve
For context, over 40% of dementia free elderly exhibit AD biomarkers in pathological range
In a recent brain MRI study of midlife women, longer reproductive span was associated with larger superior parietal and precuneus GM volume, independent of age, APOE-4 status, type of menopause (surgical vs spontaneous) midlife health indicators, and use of menopausal HT
GM volume is a proxy for cognitive reserve, with larger volume indicating less neuronal aging
Therefore, MRI findings suggest a beneficial effect of longer endogenous estrogen exposure, at least in midlife.
Since the pre-symptomatic phase of AD corresponds with midlife years
In fact, these results are consistent with epidemiological studies of younger women with a narrower window of age at menopause
The two studies reporting negative effects of a longer reproductive span on AD risk instead focused on older postmenopausal women over 70
Further comparison across studies is made difficult by substantial heterogeneity of the study cohorts, including differences in geographical areas, ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and overall medical health, as well as different clinical criteria for AD and dementia diagnosis, and variable cognitive batteries across studies.

Parity, Number of Children and Pregnancies
Pregnancy is a female-specific reproductive event that induces profound changes in the levels of endogenous estrogen, with significant effects on brain structure and function (de Lange et al., 2020).
Higher levels of estradiol are observed during pregnancy, up to 300 times the normal circulating levels
However, the effects of pregnancy on the brain are complex and more rigorous work is needed to elucidate how these biological mechanisms impact cognitive aging.
For instance, parous women have lower levels of circulating estrogen compared to nulliparous women, with this difference persisting into menopause
On the other hand, parity has positive effects on the brain's long-term sensitivity to estrogen via effects on ER expression or functioning as evidenced by findings that parous rats have higher numbers of ERα positive cells than age-matched, nulliparous controls
There is also evidence that parity renders the human brain more responsive to estrogen in older age, which might contribute to favorable brain aging trajectories
In studies investigating the long-term association between pregnancy-related factors and risk of cognitive impairment in later life, associations are mixed, as summarized in Table
Some studies report better cognitive performance in midlife
Two large European studies reported less apparent brain aging in parous compared to nulliparous women, especially in association with a higher number of childbirths, as predicted using MRI-based machine learning models
Studies of midlife women have also reported positive effects of parity on cognitive performance, such as improved verbal and visual memory performance
While number of children was not directly associated with cognitive performance, GM volume in temporal cortex positively correlated with memory and global cognition, suggesting possible mediation effects
Additionally, in studies that examined gravidity (total number of pregnancies including stillbirth, miscarriage, and/or abortion), elderly women who spent more cumulative months pregnant and breastfeeding over the course of a lifetime had a reduced risk of AD
Longer duration of breastfeeding was also found to be protective against AD dementia in other studies
As estrogen levels are lower during lactation, other factors are likely involved.
However, while some studies indicate that having 1-3 children may provide protective effects against dementia
Findings of no associations between number of children and memory performance or AD and dementia risk were also reported
The largest epidemiological study to date, the Rancho Bernardo Study in southern California, studied 1,025 women between the ages of 44-99 followed for over 28 years, with cognitive testing data collected at up to 7 different timepoints
Results indicated no long-term influence of pregnancy history on age-related cognitive function, except for a Jett et al.

Reproductive Health and Alzheimer's Prevention

Difference between AD patients and controls
• AD patients had more pregnancies than controls.

slight decline in verbal memory in parous vs. nulliparous women, which did not survive correction for multiple comparisons
On the other hand, in some studies, parous women had greater cognitive decline on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores
A post-mortem study reported greater AD-related neuropathology with more childbirths, though no clear associations were observed with cognitive function
Discrepancies among studies may be due to small sample sizes
Associations with cognition were more commonly observed when parity was defined as number of childbirths or time spent pregnant rather than as having vs. not having children.
Additionally, few studies have taken other pregnancy-related factors, such as age at first childbirth, breastfeeding, pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, and oral contraceptive usage into consideration.
Contrasting results might also be due to the timing of the observations, as the effects of motherhood on the brain are likely more discernible closer in time to childbirth than in older age or at post-mortem.
Generally, studies that examined associations between number of children and cognitive performance closer to the time of childbirth have more consistently reported beneficial effects of pregnancy on brain and cognition function

EXOGENOUS ESTROGEN EXPOSURES Hormonal Therapy for Menopause
If estrogen depletion in midlife is associated with increased risk of AD in later life, then theoretically estrogen therapy could reduce risk of AD.
Although an increasing number of studies have explored menopausal HT for AD risk reduction, data regarding this issue is mixed.
There are strong discrepancies between basic science, observational studies, and small clinical trials of HT on the one hand, and large randomized clinical trials of HT on the other hand.
The former studies generally reported a protective effect of HT on cognitive function and AD risk
Positive effects were more consistent with estrogen-only, or unopposed HT, for hysterectomized women
These results are in contrast with large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of HT, starting with the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a 15-year study tracking over 161,800 healthy, postmenopausal women.
The study included two trials, the WHI Estrogen-plus-Progestin Study, in which women with a uterus were randomly assigned to receive either HT containing both estrogen and a progestin (Prempro) or a placebo; and the WHI Estrogen-Alone Study, in which women without a uterus were randomly assigned to receive either HT containing estrogen alone (Premarin) or a placebo.
Cumulatively, the WHI has shown some benefits related to use of HT, including one-third fewer hip and vertebral fractures, and one-third lower risk of colorectal cancer relative to placebo
However, both trials were interrupted early as it was determined that both types of therapy were associated with specific health risks, particularly an increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke and blood clots
In both trials, risk of heart disease returned to normal levels after treatment discontinuation
Additionally, the Estrogen-plus-Progestin arm of the study showed an increased risk of cancer
The WHI included an additional arm, the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS), which examined HT for dementia prevention in postmenopausal women ages 65 or older
Instead, results indicated a doubling of the risk of all-cause dementia among women in the Estrogen-plus-Progestin arm
A major problem with this study is that participants were several years past menopause at enrollment, thus possibly already harboring preexisting dementia or cardiovascular conditions.
Re-examination of the WHI data indicates that the efficacy of HT is linked to the timing of initiation with respect to age at menopause onset
On meta-analysis, younger, 50-59 year-old women who used HT had a 30-44% reduction in AD risk as compared to never-users
In the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE), HT reduced the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis when therapy was initiated soon after menopause
The newer ELITE-cog and Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) trials have so far reported no adverse effects of HT on cognition among recently postmenopausal women, though no beneficial effects were observed either
Clinical trials using brain scans as a secondary endpoint lend support to the hypothesis that both age at treatment and type of HT are important factors to consider.
Some studies indicated positive effects of HT on GM volume
Further, oral conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) therapy was associated with reduced GM volume

Hormonal Contraceptives
Despite the millions of women worldwide using HC, little is known about HC effects on the brain
Systemic HC have been available since the 1960s, sold under various brand names and formulations, most of which are administered orally, transdermally, transvaginally or via implants.
HC are comprised of synthetic sex hormones, often ethinylestradiol, a more potent form of endogenous estradiol and synthetic progestin, which can either be androgenic or anti-androgenic
The functions of HC treatment involve several mechanisms that lead to the inhibition of follicular development, suppression of the production of endogenous estradiol and progesterone, and preventing ovulation
Although studies investigating the impact of HC on later life cognition are scarce, 56% of the studies report a reduced risk of cognitive impairment
One study reported an almost 50% reduced risk of cognitive impairment in elderly women aged 60 or older who had used HC compared to never users
Structural MRI studies of young adult women generally show greater GM volume in HCusers compared to natural cycling women in the hippocampus, parahippocampal and fusiform gyri, and cerebellum
Among midlife women at risk for AD, HC users exhibited greater GM volume in medial temporal lobe, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, parietal and frontal cortex as compared to never users
The remaining studies reported no associations between HC use and dementia incidence
Inconsistent findings may be a result of several factors such as age of initiation, HC formulations, dosage and duration of use

Endocrine Therapy for Breast Cancer
Every year, 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer, which still results in over 400,000 deaths annually
Nearly 13% of American women are diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their life
While breast cancer is a multi-factorial disease, it has a known hormonal component.
Around 75% of all breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive (HRP) and patients are usually advised to undergo adjuvant endocrine therapy.
In this section, we review data on the effects of anti-estrogen therapy on cognition, as treatment with estrogen blockers and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) suppresses estrogenic function in body and brain
This has spurred concerns around dementia risk in breast cancer survivors.
Two of the most frequently prescribed classes of endocrine therapy for breast cancer are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g., tamoxifen and raloxifene), and steroidal (i.e., exemestane) and non-steroidal AIs (i.e., anastrozole and letrozole).
SERMs have tissue-specific agonistic and antagonistic actions on estrogen receptors, while AIs inhibit estrogen production in body and brain.
Premenopausal women with HRP cancer typically receive tamoxifen whereas postmenopausal women receive AI monotherapy, or AI as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with tamoxifen
Both therapies can include adjuvant chemotherapy depending on clinicopathological indications
Owing to the increasing awareness of the importance of estrogens for brain health, more research is now focused on evaluating the potential adverse impact of endocrine therapies on cognition and AD risk in patients with breast cancer
Several studies have indicated that chemotherapy with or without endocrine therapy can induce cognitive changes, especially declines in memory, processing speed, and executive function, as compared to pre-treatment levels
Cognitive declines have been reported in 20-60% of chemotherapy-treated cancer survivors
However, as many patients in these studies received both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, the specific influence of hormonal treatment on cognition remains unclear.
Herein, we review the studies that specifically addressed the cognitive effects of endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer.
To date, three large intervention trials have conducted sub-studies to examine the effects of endocrine therapy on cognitive function in women with breast cancer.
In the Arimidex Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial, five years of therapy with anastrozole alone, tamoxifen alone, and the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen was associated with significantly lower scores on verbal memory and processing speed assessments in postmenopausal women with invasive operable breast cancer who had completed primary therapy and eligible for adjuvant hormonal therapy (including 20-22% on chemotherapy) relative to an age-controlled group of cancerfree women
A second analysis of the ATAC study compared cancer patients who had received surgery and various endocrine treatments with controls.
None of the patients had done chemotherapy, and 67% were treated with course of radiotherapy.
Results showed that patients receiving anastrozole, tamoxifen and combined treatment performed significantly worse on tasks of verbal memory and processing speed as compared to an age-controlled group of cancer-free women, independent of prior HT use
No information was provided as to whether these effects differed by type of endocrine therapy.
The Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) study examined breast cancer patients who commenced treatment within 10 weeks of completion of surgery and chemotherapy if indicated (nearly 2/3 for both tamoxifen followed by exemestane and exemestane alone groups did not have adjuvant chemotherapy) and cancer-free controls (van de
Direct comparison of the use of tamoxifen or exemestane revealed a significant decline in verbal memory and executive functioning, especially processing speed, with tamoxifen use, and no negative effects of exemestane relative to controls
These outcomes were more pronounced in patients aged 65 and older, suggesting a possible age-dependent effect of tamoxifen on cognition.
Follow-up one year after cessation of therapy demonstrated improvement in cognitive scores for all groups.
Finally, the Breast International Group 198 study (BIG 198)
Some of these patients also received chemotherapy (24% for tamoxifen group, 35% for letrozole group).
Using a cognitive composite score, results indicated significantly higher cognitive performance in the letrozole arm compared with the tamoxifen arm, although both groups performed below age-adjusted norms on the majority of tests
Additionally, a neuroimaging study of postmenopausal women found that older women currently taking tamoxifen had smaller hippocampal volumes as compared to women taking unopposed estrogen therapy for menopause
Further investigation to account for menopause HT use, menopausal status, age since menopause, and pre-treatment hormonal status is warranted.
Nonetheless, clinical trial results are consistent with the few observational studies that examined the influence of tamoxifen on cognition in truly chemotherapynaive patients.
Although limited due to small sample sizes, unmatched ages, and mixed treatment durations, these studies consistently showed negative effects of tamoxifen on verbal memory and fluency
In summary, tamoxifen, but not AIs, may be associated with negative cognitive effects in postmenopausal women.
However, these effects appear to be temporary as improvements in cognitive function after therapy completion have been described
Only two studies have specifically examined endocrine therapy independent of chemotherapy or radiation therapy as a risk factor for AD.
One study reported a decrease in AD incidence in treated vs. untreated breast cancer patients
Other studies to date focused on mixed treatment populations, and reported conflicting findings of no associations with dementia
In two studies, SERM-treated breast cancer patients over the age of 70 had 12-18% lower risk of AD or dementia compared to untreated patients
The protection associated with the SERMs was exclusively due to tamoxifen, and not to raloxifene
Additionally, older patients receiving the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane had a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of AD and dementia compared with patients receiving the non-steroidal therapies anastrozole and letrozole
Discrepancies among studies may be due to different assessments of outcome
Future studies are needed to better characterize the relationship between endocrine therapy and AD risk in women.

Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy
Transgender people experience gender dysphoria due to incongruence between their gender identity and the sex they were assigned at birth
Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GHT) is the primary intervention sought by transgender people.
GHT allows the acquisition of secondary sex characteristics more aligned with an individual's gender identity, in part by reducing characteristics of biological sex
The mainstay of this lifelong treatment in transgender men is testosterone, typically delivered as intramuscular testosterone undecanoate or ester formulation
Transgender women typically receive oral or transdermal estrogen preparations often in conjunction with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog or an anti-androgen
Evidence for negative effects of same-sex hormone deprivation on cognitive aging and AD risk begs the question of whether GHT impacts cognitive functioning in transgender individuals.
While neuropsychological research on this topic is limited, meta-analysis indicates no adverse effects of GHT in young adult transgender men or women
Rather, young transgender men exhibited a significant enhancement of visuospatial ability following testosterone treatment
GHT effects on cognition in older individuals are less clear as only one study of transgender women has investigated the long-term effects of
This study compared 37 transgender women receiving GHT for at least 10 years (range 10-42 years) to an age and education level matched cohort of 222 cisgender women and men, showing that transgender women performed similar to cisgender men on all tests, but scored lower than cisgender women on immediate and delayed recall tests
No long-term studies of transgender men have been published.
Brain imaging studies thus far are also limited to transgender young adults
MRI studies of transgender women demonstrate that estradiol plus antiandrogen therapy was associated with a decrease in brain volume and an increase in ventricular volume after four to six months of treatment
Cortical thickness was also reduced post-treatment, with the strongest changes observed in occipital and parieto-temporal regions
On the contrary, four months of androgen treatment increased total brain volume, total gray matter volume, and hypothalamic and thalamic volumes, as well as cortical thickness in parieto-occipital regions of transgender men
Additionally, 7 months of testosterone treatment increased fractional anisotropy in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and corticospinal tract of transgender men
These increases might be due to anabolic effects of testosterone and its reduced metabolite dihydrotestosterone, which bind androgen receptors and to a lesser extent estrogen receptors
The suppression of testosterone via antiandrogens in transgender women might therefore diminish the anabolic tone in brain tissues and induce decreases in volume
Epidemiological data indicates that the use of estrogens in transgender women confers an increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, whereas transgender men receiving testosterone lack any consistent evidence of increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease
Overall, limited research indicates that GHT impacts the morphology as well as the connectivity of the brain in young transgender adults, possibly aligning their brains to the morphological characteristics of the desired gender.
These changes do not appear to have negative effects on cognition in the short term.
Short and long-term studies of older transgender people are lacking.

CONCLUSION
Worldwide populations are aging and with advanced age is an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.
While for many years the prevailing view held women's greater longevity relative to men as the main reason for women's higher AD prevalence
There is growing consensus that, to stem the AD epidemic, sex-specific interventions that can potentially slow or reverse the trajectory of AD earlier in the course of the disease will be required.
Recent evidence that AD starts in midlife
Currently, menopause is the most widely investigated female-specific risk factor for AD
The neuroprotective effects exerted by estrogens have been proposed as a major reason for reduced signs of cerebrovascular and metabolic aging in premenopausal women compared to men
When estrogen withdrawal occurs during menopause, effects of accelerated cellular aging become evident in the CNS and in the periphery, possibly leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative events and AD
While very little work has been done to investigate changes in cognition and AD biomarkers during the transition to menopause, recent translational neuroimaging studies have provided in vivo evidence for emergence of AD endophenotypes in midlife women
Surgically induced menopause is associated with higher risk of AD and of AD biomarkers, especially in presence of an earlier age at oophorectomy
Menopauserelated midlife deficits in glucose metabolism and activation of amyloidogenic processes could be early indicators of prodromal AD contributing to the sex difference in AD prevalence.
Altogether, clinical and biomarker data suggest an earlier start of AD pathogenesis in women than men, with onset in the perimenopause.
The evidence for a connection between estrogen deprivation and AD risk has prompted investigation of additional indicators of estrogen exposure as predictors of dementia.
Epidemiological studies to date have yielded conflicting results regarding estrogen exposure and dementia risk as proxies of lower lifetime estrogen exposure, such as later age at menarche and younger age at menopause, have been shown to be associated with increased, reduced, and null risk of cognitive impairment, dementia and AD in later life.
While results on parity, pregnancy and number of children are mixed, recent neuroimaging data indicates a protective role of pregnancy against AD-biomarker risk in women, but not men
This suggests that the biological process of pregnancy and the hormonal changes that accompany it, rather than lifestyle factors involved with raising children, may be associated with AD risk, though the exact relationship remains to be elucidated.
More studies with larger and more diverse samples, neuroimaging biomarkers, and longer follow-up periods are needed to clarify the relationships between cumulative estrogen exposure and AD risk in women.
Among exogenous estrogen exposures, menopausal HT use has been heavily scrutinized due to the disparity between basic science, observational studies, and large randomized clinical trials.
HT action on brain is dependent on multiple factors, including chronological age, stage of reproductive aging, duration of hypogonadism, and presence of symptoms, as well as the formulation of HT, route of administration, and the health status of the brain.
There is mounting evidence that HT use in midlife may help sustain neurological health and reduce the risk of AD
While more work is needed, recent neuroimaging data in midlife women also suggests that HT use near the time of menopause may have positive effects on brain aging
Currently, menopause HT is not recommended for AD prevention or cognition preservation in women of menopausal age.
Personalized physician advice which takes into consideration key factors including age, menopausal stage, symptoms, and comorbidities, may offer a greater look at how HT impacts AD risk as compared to the one-size-fits-all approach of randomized clinical trials, and argues for a precision medicine approach to HT use
While studies of HC use in midlife and elderly women are scarce, there is evidence for positive associations between history of HC use and cognitive function
In structural MRI studies, women at risk for AD who had ever taken HC exhibited larger regional GM volumes as compared to never users
Given that over 100 million women are using HC, with the number increasing yearly
Neuropsychological studies and clinical trials of endocrine therapies for estrogen-positive cancer, including SERMs and aromatase inhibitors, suggest that adverse effects on cognition can exist, with and without chemotherapy, but may depend on the specific therapy used
While not conclusive, a growing body of evidence from observational studies point to potential adverse effects of tamoxifen on cognition, whereas negative effects of aromatase inhibitor treatment are currently not consistent (van de
While studies linking anti-estrogen therapies to AD risk are scarce, the evidence so far indicates no clear increase in AD risk with tamoxifen and steroidal aromatase inhibitors, as one study found a decrease in AD incidence with endocrine therapy use
More work is needed to examine the effects of endocrine therapy on AD and dementia risk separately from those of chemotherapy, and to account for background hormonal milieu, previous HT and HC use, and age since menopause as important effect modifiers.
Investigating the potential effects of anti-estrogen endocrine therapy for cancer on cognition is of increasing importance, as current guidelines permit the choice between different regimens.
While short-term studies reported no negative impact of GHT on cognition, evidence of the long-term impact of GHT on cognition is lacking, especially with respect to AD risk in older age.
Risks may become more apparent with aging, and with longer duration of hormone use.
Older transgender individuals are an especially vulnerable group, as they have higher risk of experiencing stress and depressive symptoms than cisgender individuals (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2014), report higher rates of subjective cognitive decline
Overall, sex steroid hormones are a long overlooked but critical contributor to cognitive aging.
While the neurobiological consequences of reproductive history and hormonal changes on brain aging and AD risk have only begun to be understood, converging evidence supports a role for cumulative estrogen exposure in reducing risk of AD and dementia later in life.
This strongly argues for continued examination of sex hormones and reproductive history factors in AD prevention strategies for women.
There is an urgent need for prospective epidemiological, clinical and biomarkers studies with data taken at several timepoints starting at midlife that examine the associations between cumulative estrogen exposure and cognitive function in later life.
Understanding the dynamic interplay between sex, chronological aging, endocrine aging, and additional risk factors is crucial to inform and justify primary prevention strategies targeting female-specific risk factors underlying the increased prevalence of AD in women, and for development of future personalized preventive care.
