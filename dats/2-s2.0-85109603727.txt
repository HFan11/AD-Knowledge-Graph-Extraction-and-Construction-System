Dendritic/Post-synaptic Tau and Early Pathology of Alzheimer’s Disease
Microtubule-associated protein tau forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is one of the major histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Many studies have demonstrated that tau causes early functional deficits prior to the formation of neurofibrillary aggregates.
The redistribution of tau from axons to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons and dendritic spines causes synaptic impairment, and then leads to the loss of synaptic contacts that correlates better with cognitive deficits than amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates do in AD patients.
In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms by which tau is mislocalized to dendritic spines and contributes to synaptic dysfunction in AD.
We also discuss the synergistic effects of tau and oligomeric forms of Aβ on promoting synaptic dysfunction in AD.

INTRODUCTION
Tau is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that participates in microtubule assembly and stabilization
Tau protein has a very dynamic interaction with microtubules
This highly dynamic interaction had been described as a kiss and hop mechanism with 40 ms dwell time
Tau is encoded by MAPT gene including 16 exons on chromosome 17q21
Six molecular isoforms of tau are generated from alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 in MAPT gene transcripts in human brain
These six tau isoforms including three 3R taus (0N3R, 1N3R, and 2N3R) and three 4R taus (0N4R, 1N4R, and 2N4R), differ in containing three (3R taus) or four (4R taus) microtubule binding repeats (R) of 31-32 amino acids in the carboxyl terminal half and zero (0N), one (1N), or two (2N) amino terminal inserts of 29 amino acids each
Tau is phosphorylated at serine/threonine sites or/and tyrosine sites, and the biological activity of tau is regulated by the degree of phosphorylation modification
All of the six tau isoforms are hyperphosphorylated and aggregated into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain (Grundke-
A disease-like pseudohyperphosphorylation of tau dramatically diminishes the taumicrotubules interaction
Interestingly, tau protein in the brain becomes highly phosphorylated during hibernation in different species, such as arctic ground squirrel, Syrian hamsters and black bears, and this hyperphosphorylation is reversed after arousal
To date, the majority research of tau pathology has been concentrated on the processes of tau aggregation and its subsequent toxicity to neurons.
In this review, we focus on the mislocalization of tau from axons to dendrites and post-synapses.
It is an earlier event in AD pathogenesis prior to the formation of amyloid plaques and NFTs and therefore may be a preferable therapeutic target.

SYNAPTIC LOCALIZATION OF TAU Tau Distribution Under Physiological Conditions
Most of tau localizes in the distal segment of the axon, lower concentrations are found in the proximal segment of the axon, and the lowest levels in the soma and dendrites
It is reported that approximately three times more tau exists in the white matter (mainly containing axons) than the gray matter (mainly containing dendrites and cell bodies) of rat and bovine brains
Studies also found endogenous tau localized in dendrites and post-synapses of rodent neurons
Endogenous murine tau was shown to localize to dendritic spines
Furthermore, physiological tau was observed both at presynaptic and postsynaptic termini in human brains
The post-synaptic localization of tau suggests that tau has physiological functions not only in the axon but also in the synapse
Tau plays roles in microtubule stabilization and axonal transport as an axonal cytoskeletal protein

Possible Mechanisms of Physiological Tau Distribution
The underlying mechanisms responsible for the axonal tau gradient are in dispute.
Evidence suggests several overlapping mechanisms.
First, since the affinity of tau to axonal microtubules is higher than that of dendrites or soma in neurons, tau is predominantly localized to axons
The axon initial segment (AIS) also provides a barrier limiting the amount of tau to relocate from axons to the soma
This retrograde diffusional restriction of tau may be governed by several proteinprotein interactions of tau with AIS complexes (such as ankyrin G/EB1, GSK3β)
Second, tau is selectively degraded in the somatodendritic compartment by autophagy and proteasomes.
Third, the distribution of tau mRNA connects with native introns and untranslated regions UTR

TAU BINDING PROTEINS IN THE POST-SYNAPSE
Tau interacts with the Src family kinase Fyn via its Proline-X-X-Proline (PXXP) motifs in the Proline-rich region
Fyn fails to localize to the synapse in tau-depleted neurons
The tau/Fyn complex binds to PSD-95 (post-synaptic density protein 95) at the postsynapse
PSD-95 is a key scaffolding protein for post-synaptic receptors
The interaction between PSD-95 and NMDAR or AMPAR is primarily mediated by the postsynaptic density-95, diskslarge, zona occludens 1 (PDZ) domains
Tau connects with PSD-95 as well as NMDARs or AMPARs, the post-synaptic receptors
Tau, Fyn, PSD-95, and NMDARs are predicted to form a protein complex at the synapse (Mondragon-Rodriguez et al., 2012b) (Figure
The localized activity of Fyn is critical for NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity
Fyn phosphorylates the subunit 2B (NR2B) of NMDAR at tyrosine-1472 of cytosolic C-terminus, which promotes the interaction between NR2B and PSD-95 and results in toxic downstream signaling pathways in neurons
Decreased synaptic clustering of both NMDA and AMPA receptors is induced by the infiltration of tau into dendritic spines, thereby resulting in compromised excitatory synaptic transmission and memory deficits
Tau interacts with microtubules and regulates their turnover to modulate the dynamic movement of microtubules into and out of dendritic spines, which is important to long-term depression (LTD) induction
Similarly, tau influences the cross-talk between microtubules and actin cytoskeletal networks through direct binding to actin

ROLE OF TAU IN POST-SYNAPSE
Tau in post-synapse is crucial for LTD
Transfection of tau shRNA prevented the induction of LTD but not LTP.
The necessary role of tau in the hippocampal LTD is supported by the rescued LTD phenotype when endogenous tau was replaced with human tau.
The requirement for tau in hippocampal LTD is also verified by the selective deficits in spatial reversal learning observed in tau knockout mice
Tau also appears to modulate LTP since exposure of neurons to tau inhibits hippocampal LTP in rat hippocampal synapses
Similarly, the LTP inhibition is dependent on tau because co-injection with an antibody against tau can prevent the LTP inhibition caused by extracts of Alzheimer's disease brain
It has been identified that tau plays an important physiological role in synapses by studies using tau knockout mice
Further investigations are still required to detect the physiological roles of tau in synapses.
Tau acts as a mediator of AD-related synaptic deficits, which has been demonstrated by numerous studies (Spires-Jones and Hyman, 2014).
The increased concentration of tau in dendrites may affected memory and synaptic plasticity.
Mislocalized tau reduces the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in rats.
A silencing of synapses and reduction of AMPARs in the post synaptic site accompany a decrease in mEPSCs
Dendritic tau is mostly hyperphosphorylated
Dendritic tau is involved in dendritic loss, aberrant post-synaptic activity and cognitive dysfunction in AD or other tauopathies
Overexpression of tau in cultured neurons and AD mice increases tau in the somatodendritic compartment
Importantly, the increased postsynaptic tau was linked to spine loss in a tau transgenic mouse model
Synaptic loss is the earliest indication of neuronal malfunction and the best biological correlate of disease progression in AD and related tauopathies
Under pathological conditions, such as in human tauopathy or animal models of tau overexpression, the presence of tau at synapses is more apparent, suggesting a role for tau in disease pathogenesis

EXTERNAL STIMULI LEADING TO POST-SYNAPTIC DISTRIBUTION OF TAU
Neuronal activity and extracellular signals regulate dendritic/post-synaptic localization of tau.
Increased neuronal activity or treatment with amyloid-beta (Aβ) or glucocorticoids can increase the dendritic and synaptic localization of tau
Long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical for memory formation
Engagement and redistribution of post-synaptic glutamate receptors is critical to synaptic plasticity
In cultured neurons, activation of post-synaptic glutamate receptors induces translocation of tau from dendritic shafts into postsynaptic densities
Glucocorticoid treatment leads tau localization to soma and dendrites
Exposure to oligomeric Aβ increases levels of tau in dendrites in AD
In general, external stimuli regulate dendritic localization of tau (Figure

INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF TAU RELATED TO POST-SYNAPTIC LOCATION

Isoforms of Tau
Different tau isoforms may contribute to their dendritic and post-synaptic recruitment.
2N tau is prone to sorting into the somatodendritic compartment, compared to other tau isoforms
Whether 3R and 4R tau isoforms are differentially localized to dendrites/post-synapses remains elusive

Truncations of Tau
Caspase-2 cleaves tau at Asp314 to generate tau314, which is necessary for tau to mislocalize to dendritic spines
In addition, the caspase-3 cleavage of tau at Asp421 may contribute to tau synaptic propagation in neurons
Several lines of evidence suggest that truncated forms of tau may also contribute to synaptic dysfunction.
Mutating Asp314 on tau to prevent the caspase-2 cleavage of human P301L tau blocks mislocalization of tau to the dendritic compartment and prevents cognitive impairment in AD mouse models
Normal memory and dendritic spine morphology are exhibited in J20 APP transgenic mice lacking caspase-2

Post-translational Modifications of Tau
Tau undergoes several post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and glycosylation
Tau has more than 45 phosphorylation sites mainly located in its proline-rich domain and C-terminal domain
Phosphorylation of tau directly affects the distribution of tau to dendrite and post-synapse.
Individual phosphorylationmimicking tau mutants at T231/S235, S262/S356, or S396/S404 enhances localization of tau into dendritic spines in cultured neurons
Phosphorylation-mimicking tau with 14 simultaneous mutant sites induces tau to dendritic spines in cultured neurons, then reduces AMPA receptors and finally leads to synaptic impairments
Furthermore, increased tau phosphorylation causes mislocalization of tau to post-synaptic sites both in AD brain and in transgenic mice overexpressing P301S tau
A series of studies indicate that one of the potential mechanisms responsible for post-synaptic localization of tau may be the association of tau with the tyrosine kinase Fyn.
Increasing phosphorylation level of tau at sites such as Ser396, Ser404, Thr205, Thr231, and Ser235 promotes dissociation of the Tau/Fyn/PSD95 complex, which is crucial for LTD induction
In the same regard, phosphorylation of tau at Ser396 is necessary for the expression of hippocampal LTD
Non-phosphorylated tau contributes to LTP, while phosphorylated tau contributes to LTD
Tau phosphorylation, induced by the Pro301 to Leu301 mutation linked to FTDP-17, also weakens the AIS barrier by structurally modifying the AIS and shifting its location
Bovine tau is modified by O-GlcNAcylation, a unique type of O-glycosylation for cytosolic proteins
Human brain tau is also O-GlcNAcylated, and O-GlcNAcylation regulates phosphorylation of tau in a site-specific manner
Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of tau results in hyperphosphorylation of tau
O-GlcNAcylation of tau prevents tau from oligomerization and decreases neuronal cell loss
Acetylation of tau in post-synapse participates in an activitydependent pathway regulating synaptic plasticity and memory.
Acetylation-mimicking tau mutants reduce Kidney/Brain (KIBRA) protein, a known regulator of AMPARs and memory
This impairment affects memory and is associated with AD
Acetylated tau reduces KIBRA and impairs LTP by impeding activity-induced actin polymerization and thereby affecting postsynaptic membrane localization of AMPA receptors, which implicates the vital function of tau in regulating synaptic plasticity
Acetylation of tau destabilizes the AIS, weakens the barrier, and allows retrograde redistribution of tau into the somatodendrites

TAU AND Aβ
Amyloid-β may initiate mislocalization of tau at dendrites, which in turn can affect accumulation of Aβ.
Oligomerized Aβ can only increase mislocalization of tau to the dendrites when tau is phosphorylated
Fyn is the mediator between Aβ and tau.
Aβ promotes the post-synaptic localization of tau, and then the increased concentration of tau attracts Fyn to phosphorylate and activate NMDA receptor and triggers excitotoxicity due to calcium dyshomeostasis
It has been reported that decreasing tau levels in Aβ-forming AD mouse models prevented the post-synaptic dysfunction
In contrast, increasing tau levels in amyloidosis mouse models enhanced synaptic loss and memory impairment
Tau phosphorylation contributes to dendritic spine loss
Colocalization of Aβ and tau is shown in approximately one third of synapses in AD brain
GSK3β may be the central factor linking extracellular Aβ and intracellular tau
Deregulation of Cdk5 caused by the accumulation of p25, a truncated fragment of p35, contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.
The p25/Cdk5 kinase phosphorylates tau efficiently and hinders tau from binding to microtubules
Proteomics data suggest that misfolded Aβ may activate CDK5 to phosphorylate tau at synaptic sites
Eliminating the specific AMPK phosphorylation of tau prevents the Aβinduced loss of dendritic spines and restores synaptic functions
On the contrary, post-synaptic p38γ-mediated tau phosphorylation alleviates Aβinduced excitotoxicity, suggesting the protective function of tau phosphorylation in the post-synaptic compartment
Oligomeric Aβ was shown to inhibit activity of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and increase acetylation levels of tau, resulting in loss of tau polarization

CONCLUSION
In the present review, we discuss somatodendritic and postsynaptic localizations of tau under both physiological and pathological conditions.
Mislocalization of tau to dendrites and post-synapses triggered by external and intrinsic factors is an early event in AD pathogenesis before tau aggregation (Figure
Synaptic tau, a mediator of AD-related synaptic deficits, associates with the onset of cognitive decline in AD.
Synaptic impairments take place much earlier in AD pathogenesis than the formation of NFTs.
Synaptic loss is highly correlated with cognitive decline and is the first indicator of AD progress.
Abnormal PTMs of tau, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and truncation, can all contribute to its mislocalization at synaptic sites.
Aβ and tau drive synaptic dysfunction synergistically, which is the latent initial crisis in AD (Figure
Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting synaptic tau might be promising in intervening early pathological events in AD.
