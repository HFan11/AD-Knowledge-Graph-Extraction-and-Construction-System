Plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, p‐tau181, GFAP, and NfL across the Alzheimer's disease continuum: A cross‐sectional and longitudinal study in the AIBL cohort
Introduction: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL) are putative blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Results: Lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 and GFAP were observed in CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ+, and AD Aβ+, whereas elevated plasma NfL was observed in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+, compared with CU Aβ-and MCI Aβ-.
Among the aforementioned plasma biomarkers, for models with and without AD risk factors (age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status), p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting a brain Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum.
However, for models with and without the AD risk factors, a biomarker panel of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP performed equivalent to or better than any of the biomarkers alone in predicting brain Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum.
Longitudinally, plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in MCI compared with CU, and plasma GFAP and NfL were altered in AD compared with CU.
In addition, lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and higher p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were associated with prospective cognitive decline and lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and higher p-tau181 and GFAP were associated with increased Aβ-PET load prospectively.
Discussion: These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered crosssectionally and longitudinally, along the AD continuum, and are prospectively associated with cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load.
In addition, although p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting an Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum, a panel of biomarkers may have superior Aβ-/+ status predictive capability across the AD continuum.

INTRODUCTION
Abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau buildup in the brain measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and Aβ42 and phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the current core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
These biomarkers reflect AD neuropathology and begin to manifest two decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms.
However, the high cost, low throughput, and exposure to radiation associated with PET and the perceived invasiveness and expertise associated with lumbar puncture have all highlighted the need for surrogate markers in the blood.
Plasma Aβ (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio), p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) are some of the putative blood-based biomarkers for AD.
Circulating levels of these biomarkers have been reported to reflect AD-related neuropathological processes such as impaired clearance of brain Aβ, disruption of the axonal cytoskeletal structure, and reactive astrogliosis.

Therefore, in the current study, we carried out a head-to-head comparison of plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL alterations between Aβ-PET-negative (Aβ-) and Aβ-PET-positive (Aβ+) individuals across the AD continuum and evaluated the Aβ-/+ status predictive performance of these biomarkers against each other before and after the addition of AD risk factors, as well as evaluated their Aβ-/+ predictive performance as a biomarker panel before and after the addition of AD risk factors.
In addition, we investigated the longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers between the diagnostic groups over 36 months and investigated the association of plasma biomarkers at baseline with prospective cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load over a duration of 7 to 10 years.

was 5.58%.
Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, GFAP, and NfL were measured using the Neurology 4-Plex E kit (QTX-103670, Quanterix, Billerica, MA), where calibrators were run in duplicates and samples in singlicates.
Average CV% of previous batches run in duplicate in our laboratory for Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, GFAP, and NfL were 1.56%, 2.91%, 3.26%, and 3.20%, respectively.
Quality control (QC) was attained by assessing the levels of the positive controls provided in the Simoa kits.
The analytical lowest limit of quantification was 0.338 pg/mL for p-tau181, 4.08 pg/mL for Aβ1-40, 1.51 pg/mL for Aβ1-42, 11.6 pg/mL for GFAP, and 1.6 pg/mL for NfL.
The average %CV of the two quality controls was 1.7% and 6.6% for p-tau181, 0.2% and 2.19% for Aβ1-40, 1.28% and 1.06% for Aβ1-42, 1.68% and 1.46% for GFAP, and 0.17% and 1.48% for NfL, respectively.

Measurement of plasma

Neuroimaging
All participants underwent Aβ-PET imaging with either 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB),
A CL value >20 was selected to determine a high Aβ (Aβ+) scan.

Neuropsychological testing
Participants underwent a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests as described previously.
For this study, the primary mea- period of 4.5 years for participants whose plasma samples were available at timepoint 1. Plasma biomarkers were natural log transformed to better approximate normality and variance homogeneity as required for analyses.
All analyses and data visualization were carried out using IBM SPSS (v27) or R (v4.0.4).
p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant and all statistical tests were two-tailed.

Longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers in MCI and AD compared with CU

Association of baseline plasma biomarker levels with prospective cognitive decline and Aβ-PET load
Analyses were performed to investigate whether plasma biomarker levels from a single timepoint were associated with prospective cognitive decline and cerebral Aβ accumulation.
In all participants, lower baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio was associated with increased future cognitive decline (MMSE: p = 0.041; CDR-SOB: p = 0.049) and higher baseline p-tau181 (MMSE: p < 0.0001; CDR-SOB: p < 0.0001; PACC: p < 0.0001), GFAP (MMSE: p < 0.0001; CDR-SOB: p < 0.0001; PACC: p < 0.001), and NfL (MMSE: p < 0.0001; CDR-SOB: p < 0.0001; PACC: p < 0.0001) measures were observed to be associated with increased future cognitive decline (Table
On stratifying participants based on cognitive status, in cognitively unimpaired participants, baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio was not observed to be associated with future cognitive decline; however, higher baseline plasma p-tau181 (PACC: p < 0.001), GFAP (PACC: p = 0.020) and NfL (MMSE: p = 0.019; PACC: p = 0.046) measures were observed to be associated with increased future cognitive decline (Table
In cognitively impaired participants (MCI and AD), lower baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio was associated significantly with prospective decline in CDR-SOB (p = 0.020).
Furthermore, higher baseline plasma p-tau181 (MMSE: p < 0.0001; CDR-SOB: p < 0.0001; PACC: p < 0.0001), GFAP (MMSE: p < 0.001; CDR-SOB: p < 0.0001; PACC: p < 0.01), and NfL (MMSE: p < 0.01; CDR-SOB: p < 0.01; PACC: p < 0.01) measures were observed to be associated with increased future cognitive decline (Table
In addition, lower baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio (p < 0.001) and higher p-tau181 (p < 0.0001) and GFAP (p < 0.01) were observed to be associated with increased future Aβ-PET load in all participants; however, upon stratification by cognitive impairment status, the preceding observations remained significant only in cognitively unimpaired participants.

DISCUSSION
In the current study we showed that plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio was lower, and p-tau181 and GFAP levels were higher in Aβ+ individuals across the AD continuum, and that plasma NfL levels were higher in cognitively impaired Aβ+ individuals compared with controls.
Our observations of lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio,
Further validation studies are required to confirm whether these observations could be attributed to the differences in sample size between groups.
Our observations of elevated NfL in prodromal AD and AD but not in Aβ+ defined preclinical AD are also in line with previous studies.
3]
Although head-to-head studies for plasma biomarkers across the AD continuum are largely missing, one study reported that p-tau181 outperformed Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, GFAP, and NfL in differentiating between AD and CU; however, unlike the current study, these findings are not from Aβ-/+ status confirmed participants.
Autopsy studies demonstrate that diagnosis of AD based on clinical criteria has limited sensitivity and specificity,
In the current study, we observed that there was no significant difference in the discriminative performance of p-tau181 and GFAP between AD Aβ+ and CU Aβ-, and that both outperformed Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and NfL.
Our observations of non-significant differences between the AUCs of p-tau181 and GFAP in CU Aβ-versus CU Aβ+ are in line with our previous observations in an independent cohort, wherein plasma p-tau181 and GFAP had non-significant differences in their discriminative capabilities for preclinical AD and both significantly outperformed plasma NfL.
Strikingly, in the current study at timepoint not seen previously using the Simoa platform.
Furthermore, our observations within the current study suggest that employing a panel of plasma biomarkers comprising Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, and GFAP may provide better discriminative performance than individual plasma biomarkers, particularly when combined with the AD risk factors.
In line with our observations, Janelidze and colleagues reported a significantly higher AUC when combining p-tau181 with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio compared with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio alone in differentiating between Aβ-and Aβ+ individuals.
In addition, Verberk and colleagues showed that a panel comprising Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, GFAP, age, and APOE ε4 carrier status optimally identified Aβ+ individuals, and also reported no significant improvements with the addition of NfL, 5 similar to our findings with regard to NfL.
However, further studies investigating an optimal panel of biomarkers along with AD risk factors are required.
To date only a handful of studies have investigated longitudinal changes in the aforementioned plasma biomarkers in clinically classified MCI and AD.
In the current study, we observed a longitudinal decrease in plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and a longitudinal increase in plasma p-tau181 in MCI participants compared with controls; however, no significant longitudinal changes were observed in plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and p-tau181 levels in AD participants compared with controls.
These findings are consistent with previous CSF and plasma familial AD studies reporting that alterations in Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratios and p-tau181 levels along the disease trajectory ultimately begin to plateau following the first progressive symptom (e.g., memory, motor, or behavior) onset.
Furthermore, Rodriguez and colleagues show that the trajectory of p-tau181 is associated with the duration of AD status, wherein increases in plasma p-tau181 in AD patients were observed up to 8 to 4 years prior to death, which later plateaued.
ven that we do not have data on the duration of AD status for partic-ipants in the current study, further studies are required to investigate the trajectory of p-tau181 levels in AD participants from disease onset to death.
A previous study reported significant longitudinal increases in GFAP in MCI Aβ+ and MCI who progressed to dementia compared with MCI Aβ-and stable MCI, respectively.
Within the current study, we show that GFAP longitudinally increased in MCI and AD compared with controls, and although NfL did not significantly increase longitudinally in MCI, a significant longitudinal increase was observed in AD compared with controls.
These findings suggest a sequence in the progression of biomarkers reflecting the underlying pathological process.
In the current study we showed that plasma biomarker levels are associated with prospective cognitive decline.
Our observations of the association of baseline plasma biomarker levels with prospective cognitive decline are in line with previous studies, wherein lower baseline plasma Aβ42/40 ratio or Aβ42 levels have been reported to be associated with faster cognitive decline
to be associated with faster cognitive decline.
Furthermore, observations from the current study extend results from previous findings, wherein the majority of the aforementioned studies report associations in sample sets comprising a mix of CU and CI individuals, and not independently.
Baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, and GFAP were also observed to be associated with future brain Aβ accumulation, in line with previous reports.
Schindler and colleagues reported a 15-fold greater risk of conversion to Aβ+ in Aβ-cognitively normal individuals with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio < 0.1218 compared with individuals with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio > 0.1218.
In addition, Shen and colleagues reported that individuals with abnormal baseline plasma p-tau181 levels had a higher risk of progression to pathological brain amyloid load.
Furthermore, Pareira and colleagues have reported that plasma GFAP levels predicted Aβ accumulation before and after adjusting for age, sex, baseline Aβ status, presence of cognitive impairment, and tau PET load.
e strengths of the current study include Aβ+ defined classification, the availability of serial plasma measurements to assess longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers, and the availability of longitudinal data on cognition and brain Aβ-PET load.
It is acknowledged that this study also has its limitations.
Aβ+ defined classification was not used to assess longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers as only a modest Aβ-PET sample size with follow-up timepoints was available; however, analyses were adjusted for Aβ-/+ status at baseline.
Preliminary, longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers in groups classified using both clinical and Aβ-/+ status are; however, presented in Table
In addition, analyses could not include tau-PET-/+ status to assess early or late preclinical AD stages, given that these data were not available for the analyzed sample set.
Furthermore, the measurement of Aβ42/Aβ40 using the Simoa platform has been reported to perform inferiorly to immunoprecipitation followed by mass-spectrometry methods or the Elecsys immunoassay with respect to its predictive performance for Aβ-/+ status.
o conclude, results from the current study suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered cross-sectionally and longitudinally, sequentially along the AD continuum, and are associated with prospective cognitive decline and increase in brain Aβ-PET load.
These findings provide further evidence of the diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma biomarkers.

Methods: Plasma Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were measured utilizing the Single Molecule Array (Simoa) platform and compared cross-sectionally across the AD continuum, wherein Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography)-negative cognitively unimpaired (CU Aβ-, n = 81) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI Aβ-, n = 26) participants were compared with Aβ-PET-positive participants across the AD continuum (CU Aβ+, n = 39; MCI Aβ+, n = 33; AD Aβ+, n = 46) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) cohort.
Longitudinal plasma biomarker changes were also assessed in MCI (n = 27) and AD (n = 29) participants compared with CU (n = 120) participants.
In addition, associations between baseline plasma biomarker levels and prospective cognitive decline and Aβ-PET load were assessed over a 7 to 10-year duration.

Several studies have been conducted on the diagnostic performance of individual plasma biomarkers; however, head-to-head comparisons of the putative Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers crosssectionally and longitudinally across the AD continuum are lacking.
Interpretation: Our findings suggest that among the plasma biomarkers included in this study, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) performed ≥ the other biomarkers in predicting brain amyloid beta (Aβ)-/+ status across the AD continuum.
However, a biomarker panel of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) performed ≥ any of the biomarkers alone in predicting brain Aβ-/+ positron emission tomography (PET) status across the AD continuum.
Longitudinally, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in prodromal AD, and GFAP and neurofilament light (NfL) were altered in AD.
Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were associated with prospective cognitive decline and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP were associated with increased Aβ PET load prospectively.
Future Directions: Further studies need to validate the current observations in independent cohorts including establishment of clinical cutoffs for implementation in clinical settings.

In distinguishing between CU Aβ-and CU Aβ+, we noted a significantly higher AUC when combining BM with GFAP in a model compared with GFAP alone (p = 0.049).
In distinguishing between CU Aβ-and MCI Aβ+ groups, CU Aβ-and AD Aβ+ groups, MCI Aβ-and MCI Aβ+ groups, and MCI Aβ-and AD Aβ+ groups, we noted significantly higher AUCs when combining BM with Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio compared with Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio alone (CU Aβ-vs MCI Aβ+: p = 0.019; CU Aβ-vs AD Aβ+: p = 0.011; MCI Aβ-vs MCI Aβ+: p = 0.014; MCI Aβ-vs AD Aβ+: p = 0.017), BM with GFAP compared with GFAP alone (CU Aβ-vs MCI Aβ+: p < 0.01; CU Aβ-vs AD Aβ+: p < 0.01; MCI Aβ-vs MCI Aβ+: p < 0.01; MCI Aβ-vs AD Aβ+: p = 0.028) and BM with NfL compared with NfL alone (p < 0.01).
No significant difference in diagnostic performance of p-tau181 across the AD continuum was observed before and after the addition of the BM (Table

In addition, whether combining the BM with the plasma biomarker panel significantly improved the diagnostic performance of the plasma biomarker panel was assessed.
No significant improvement was observed after combining the BM with the plasma biomarker panel when compared with the plasma biomarker panel in distinguishing CU Aβ-versus CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ-versus MCI Aβ+, and MCI Aβ-versus AD Aβ+ groups.
In distinguishing between CU Aβ-and MCI Aβ+, significantly higher AUCs were noted on combining the BM with the plasma biomarker panel compared with the plasma biomarker panel alone (p = 0.043) (TableS9).

Estimated marginal means of plasma biomarkers Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL for CU (blue), MCI (yellow), and AD (red) participants are presented at three timepoints, 18 months apart.
Data for Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, GFAP, and NfL are presented in 120 CU, 27 MCI, and 29 AD participants and for p-tau181 are presented in 119 CU, 27 MCI, and 28 AD.
Error bars represent ±1 SE.


p-tau181 followed by GFAP showed the highest change in magnitude in Aβ+ compared with Aβ-individuals along the AD continuum.
To our knowledge this is the first head-to-head study cross-sectionally investigating plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL along the AD continuum employing Aβ+ defined preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and AD participants in a highly characterized Australian cohort utilizing an ultrasensitive platform.
We also showed that Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, and GFAP had non-significant differences in their discriminative capabilities for preclinical AD based on AUCs, and outperformed NfL.
In the cognitively impaired stages, we showed that p-tau181 outperformed NfL and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio or GFAP.Furthermore we showed that combining plasma biomarkers (particularly Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, or GFAP) with the known AD risk factors, age, sex, and APOE ε4 carrier status, most often significantly improved the discriminative performance of the known AD risk factors between CU Aβ+/MCI Aβ+/AD Aβ+ and Aβ-CU individuals.
On the other hand, we also showed that although the discriminative performance of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, GFAP, and NfL improved when the AD risk factors were combined with the plasma biomarkers, this was not the case for p-tau181.
In our longitudinal analyses, we showed that the plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio decreased and p-tau181 increased in MCI participants, GFAP increased in MCI and AD participants, and NfL increased in AD participants over 36 months compared with controls.
We also showed that baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL levels are associated with prospective cognitive decline and baseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, and GFAP are associated with prospective Aβ-PET load.



significance and potential implications for ( 1 )
clinical trials (e.g., identifying preclinical and prodromal AD participants for clinical trials, and demonstrating superiority of some biomarkers/combinations for this distinction earlier in the AD continuum, compared to NfL) and (2) clinical translation (e.g., earlier, and simpler precision diagnosis of AD).
Studies comparing differences in the putative plasma biomarkers between AD and other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases and non-neurodegenerative psychiatric disorders in clinical settings are required.
Further in-depth head-to-head comparisons between the putative plasma and CSF AD biomarkers are required; however, Tables S11-S12 and Figure S4 show comparisons and associations of plasma versus CSF Aβ42 and p-tau181 pilot data.
Future validation studies are required with an emphasis on more ethnically diverse populations.

Similar analyses between the same CU Aβ-and CU Aβ+ participants at follow-up visit timepoint 2 generated an AUC = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70-0.87)
and timepoint 3 generated AUC = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70-0.87).
It could be posited that this superior performance of plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio in preclinical AD at timepoint 1 compared to the later timepoints may be reflective of the nature of the early changes of this biomarker in the
