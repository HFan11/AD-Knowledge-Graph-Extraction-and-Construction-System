Allele-specific variation at<i>APOE</i>increases nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity but decreases risk of Alzheimer’s disease and myocardial infarction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and is highly correlated with metabolic disease.
NAFLD results from environmental exposures acting on a susceptible polygenic background.
This study performed the largest multiethnic investigation of exonic variation associated with NAFLD and correlated metabolic traits and diseases.
An exome array meta-analysis was carried out among eight multiethnic population-based cohorts (n = 16 492) with computed tomography (CT) measured hepatic steatosis.
A fixed effects meta-analysis identified five exome-wide significant loci (P < 5.30 × 10 -7 ); including a novel signal near TOMM40/APOE.
Joint analysis of TOMM40/APOE variants revealed the TOMM40 signal was attributed to APOE rs429358-T; APOE rs7412 was not associated with liver attenuation.
Moreover, rs429358-T was associated with higher serum alanine aminotransferase, liver steatosis, cirrhosis, triglycerides and obesity; as well as, lower cholesterol and decreased risk of myocardial infarction and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in phenome-wide association analyses in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, United Kingdom Biobank and/or public datasets.
These results implicate APOE in imaging-based identification of NAFLD.
This association may or may not translate to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; however, these results indicate a significant association with advanced liver disease and hepatic cirrhosis.
These findings highlight allelic heterogeneity at the APOE locus and demonstrate an inverse link between NAFLD and AD at the exome level in the largest analysis to date.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide.
It is caused by accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis) and can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis, in the absence of excessive alcohol ingestion
NAFLD is suggested to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a constellation of risk factors including abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance
MetS increases the likelihood for developing cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) (4) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
It is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
The underlying causes of NAFLD and predisposition to metabolic and other human diseases are still unknown.
NAFLD is partially mediated by genetics.
Heritability of computed tomography (CT) measured hepatic steatosis, as measured using liver attenuation, is 20-34% across populations
To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants associated with NAFLD
One exomewide study (N = 2736) identified variants in PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 associated with hepatic steatosis
Taken together, these results do not completely explain the heritability of disease suggesting additional variants have yet to be identified.
To identify potentially functional, coding variants associated with NAFLD, an exome-wide association meta-analysis was performed.
Liver attenuation was measured by CT in eight independent population-based cohorts from multiple ancestries.
Results were additionally stratified by sex and ancestry.
Conditional analyses were performed to examine individual and joint effects at significant loci.
To evaluate the effect of NALFD-associated variants on metabolic traits and selected diseases, targeted association analyses were performed in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) and United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB).
These data provide new insight into the genetic architecture of NAFLD and identify molecular links between NAFLD and metabolic disease.

Results

Study sample
The Genetics of Obesity-related Liver Disease (GOLD) Consortium consists of eight cohorts.
Study sample characteristics and quality control are shown in Supplementary Material, Table
In general, participants were middle to older aged adults, although participants from IRASFS were younger (mean age ∼ 43 versus mean 53-76 years in other cohorts), with a higher proportion of women than men.
Among the four ancestries (European, African American, Hispanic American and Chinese American), Hispanic Americans had the lowest mean CT liver attenuation values indicating increased hepatic steatosis.
Alcohol intake was generally low across all cohorts (Supplementary Material, Table

Association analysis
Exome-wide association analysis of CT-measured liver attenuation identified 19 variants from five regions that were exomewide significant, P < 5.30 × 10 -7 (Bonferroni correction for 93 621 variants; Supplementary Material, Fig.
Analyses revealed a novel exome-wide associated intronic variant in TOMM40 (rs2075650, P = 9.66 × 10 -8 ).
Known exonic associations included missense variants in PNPLA3 (I148M, rs738409, P = 1.38 × 10 -92 ), TM6SF2 (E167K, rs58542926, P = 5.52 × 10 -15 ), and GCKR (L446P, Chr: Position: chromosome and position, build 37; EA: effect allele; OA: other allele; EAF: effect allele frequency; Effect Beta: effect on inverse normalized liver attenuation by computed tomography; Effect SE: standard error of the effect; P-value: P-value of association in ancestry-combined meta-analysis; N: total number of samples; Gene: gene location of variant; Variant Annotation: protein coding or noncoding changes in transcript of genes caused by the exome-wide variants.
) (Table
Variants in these five loci accounted for 4.6% of the variance in liver attenuation, as assessed from a meta-analysis of all individuals across all ancestries.
The percent variance ranged from 2.81% for rs738409 in PNPLA3 to 0.18% for rs2075650 in TOMM40.
A quantile-quantile plot of NAFLD susceptible variants is shown in Supplementary Material, Fig.

Effects by ancestry
There was no significant heterogeneity of effects across ancestries for the exome-wide significant variants (Fig.
Across ancestries, the frequency of the liver attenuation decreasing variants were similar for LOC157273, TOMM40 and TM6SF2.
The frequency of the liver attenuation decreasing allele in PNPLA3 (rs738409) was higher in Hispanic Americans (41%) and Chinese Americans (38%) than in European Americans (23%) and African Americans (14%), similar to previous observations (8); whereas the effect was strongest in African Americans (beta = -0.32),
followed by European (beta = -0.27),
Hispanic (beta = -0.24)
and Chinese (beta = -0.19)
Americans, respectively.
Consequently, the variance explained by PNPLA3 (rs738409) was the highest in Hispanic Americans (2.91%), followed by European Americans (2.67%) and African Americans (2.40%) with the lowest in Chinese Americans (1.72%) (Supplementary Material, Table
Therefore, the smaller effect size of rs738409 in Chinese Americans contributes to the lower variance explained even though the frequency of the effect allele is closer to that of the highest effect group, i.e.
Hispanic Americans.
The fatty liver promoting allele in GCKR (rs1260326) was of highest frequency in Chinese Americans (50%) followed by European Americans (41%) then Hispanic Americans (35%) and African Americans (14%).
The effect size was also the strongest in Chinese Americans with the largest standard error (beta = -0.22 ± 0.07) attributed to modest sample size (n = 360).
Consequently, this ancestry also had the highest proportion of variance explained (2.35%), followed by African Americans (0.22%), European Americans (0.24%), and Hispanic Americans (0.11%).
European and African Americans have a comparable proportion of the variance explained due to a stronger effect in African Americans (beta = -0.10)
compared to European Americans (beta = -0.07)
compensating for their allele frequency differences.
Thus, the overall variance explained by these five loci was highest in European Americans, closely followed by Chinese Americans, Hispanic Americans and then African Americans at 4.63%, 4.58%, 4.10% and 3.88%, respectively (Supplementary Material, Table
This result was driven by differences in allele frequencies and their corresponding stronger or modest effect size of the NAFLD promoting allele in individuals of diverse ancestries.
It remains to be determined if the highest variance explained is the ancestry-specific effect sizes-allele frequency combination for the Chinese American or random variation secondary to the smaller sample size compared to other ancestries.

Effects by sex
Sex-specific analyses were conducted in a manner similar to above except without sex as a covariate.
There was no significant heterogeneity for effects for any of the five loci across ancestries in men or women meta-analyzed separately.
Furthermore, there was no evidence for significant heterogeneity between men and women at any of the five loci when all ancestries were combined (Fig.

Identification of secondary signals
To identify secondary signals at exome-wide significant loci, we performed approximate joint and conditional SNP association analysis using summary statistics in European and African ancestries separately controlling for exome-wide significant variants (Table
In African Americans, an intronic variant (rs2281135, effect allele frequency of 14%) and a missense variant (rs6006460, S453I, effect allele frequency of 90%) in PNPLA3 were associated with liver attenuation (P = 0.0070 and 0.0040, respectively) after conditioning on rs738409.
In Hispanic Americans using direct conditional analysis, a missense variant (rs142056540, R138W, effect allele frequency of 1%) in TM6SF2 was associated with liver attenuation (P = 0.018) after conditioning on rs58542926.

Identification of causal variants at TOMM40/APOE
The TOMM40 associated variant, rs2075650, is not in linkage disequilibrium (LD; r 2 = 0.008) with rs7412 but has moderate LD (r 2 = 0.48) with rs429358 in European population data from 1000 Genomes (phase 3).
These two SNPs constitute the three common alleles in APOE (ApoE2 (rs429358-T, rs7412-T), ApoE3 (rs429358-T, rs7412-C) and ApoE4 (rs429358-C, rs7412-C).
APOE rs7412 was included on the exome chip across cohorts, but unlike rs2075650 showed no significant association with CT-measured liver attenuation (P = 0.89; Supplementary Material, Table
APOE rs429358 was not genotyped on the exome chip but was imputed in UKBB.
Using a surrogate measure of liver function, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), joint analyses provided evidence that TOMM40 rs2075650 was not significant (P = 0.074) when conditioned on APOE rs429358; however, APOE rs429358 remained significant (P = 1.59x10 -14 ) when conditioned on TOMM40 rs2075650 (Supplementary Material, Table
This suggests that variation at APOE rs429358 is driving the observed association.

Phenome-Wide Association analysis (PheWAS) of APOE rs429358
Effects of APOE rs429358-T were examined in UKBB and found to be associated with markers of reduced liver health including increased ALT (P = 1.97 × 10 -43 ), liver steatosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (P = 1.20 × 10 -6 ), clinical NAFLD (P = 1.21 × 10 -4 ) and cirrhosis (P = 0.028).
Consistent with these associations, the same allele was associated with increased body mass index (BMI) (P = 9.54 × 10 -14 ), waist circumference (P = 2.67 × 10 -17 ), WHRcontBMI (P = 6.57
× 10 -15 ), risk of T2D (P = 0.0019), pancreatitis (P = 0.0044) and cholelithiasis (P = 0.0016).
Strikingly, the same allele was associated with lower levels of total cholesterol (P < 1 × 10 -324 ), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P < 1 × 10 -324 ), apolipoprotein B (P < 1x10 -324 ), and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P = 7.12 × 10 -140 ), C-reactive protein (P < 1 × 10 -324 ), and apolipoprotein A (P = 8.53 × 10 -188 ).
Consistent with prior literature, APOE rs429358-T was associated with a lower risk of AD (P = 1.62 × 10 -65 ), and ischemic heart disease (P = 1.48 × 10 -15 ) (Fig.
Interestingly, the same pattern of associations, both positive and negative, are also seen for rs2075650-A (Fig.
In contrast, rs7412-T was more weakly associated ALT, had a positive association with triglyceride levels, negative association with glucose levels and WHRcontBMI, and had stronger negative associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the other two SNPs.
Importantly, rs7412-T was not associated with liverfat, T2D and pancreatitis.
The inferences regarding rs429358-T persisted after conditioning on rs2075650 and rs7412 (Fig.
All associations with rs2075650 diminished with the exception of ischemic heart disease and glucose which were both weakly associated after conditioning on the other two SNPs.
The associations with rs7412 remained unchanged after conditioning on the other two SNPs (Fig.
APOE rs429358-T was also associated with increased ALT (P = 0.0025), HDL cholesterol (P = 1.61 × 10 -04 ), and decreased serum LDL cholesterol (P = 3.05 × 10 -15 ), total cholesterol (P = 9.84 × 10 -10 ), and triglyceride (P = 0.010) and decreased risk of AD (P = 1.74 × 10 -05 ) and ischemic heart disease (P = 0.0013) in the less powered MGI cohort (Supplementary Material, Table
A literature review of publicly available GWAS analyses supported the association of APOE rs429358-T with increased risk of T2D and decreased risk of myocardial infarction and AD (Supplementary Material, Table
APOE is expressed in the brain and arteries but also in adipose tissue, liver, adrenal, kidney and pancreas in data available from GTEx (
Presence of APOE rs429358-T corresponded to lower triglyceride, phospholipid and cholesterol in extra-extra-large, extra-large and large VLDL particles compared to rs7412-T in metabolomics studies (Fig.
For most of the other lipid traits, the effects are concordant (Supplementary Material, Fig.
We show a model of the effect of T and C alleles of rs429358 on human diseases and traits in Figure

Discussion
In our multiethnic exome-wide association study of CT-measured liver attenuation we replicated the associations in four known loci including rs738409 (PNPLA3), rs58542926 (TM6SF2) and rs1260326 (GCKR) and rs4841132 in the long noncoding RNA LOC15723
Importantly, we found a new exome-wide significant signal at TOMM40, an intronic variant rs2075650.
For the first time, we show that the associations at these five loci are consistent when stratified by sex and/or ancestry.
Ancestry-specific conditional analysis identified two variants, PNPLA3 rs2281135 and rs6006460, that were nominally associated with hepatic steatosis in African-ancestry participants, with the latter previously reported
rs2281135 is in high LD with rs738409 (r 2 = 0.724) and has been associated with ALT in Europeans, South Asians and Hispanic Americans
rs6006460 has previously been associated with hepatic steatosis in African Americans
This SNP has not been associated with any traits in the GWAS catalog.
At the TM6SF2 locus, we also identified a novel variant, rs142056540, after conditioning on rs58542926 in Hispanic-ancestry individuals.
Although this variant is of low frequency in our study (<1%), it is rare in all existing databases, e.g.
BRAVO (
No studies to date have reported an association between this variant and any trait or disease.
Previous GWAS have reported associations between TOMM40 rs2075650 and various traits including BMI
These associations are consistent with our findings.
Until now, no genomewide studies have reported associations between rs2075650 and direct measures of liver disease, including hepatic steatosis as we found.
each SNP (rs2075650-A, rs429358-T and rs7412-T) alone, (B) for each SNP in joint analysis with the other two SNPs and (C) for haplotype combinations of rs429358 and rs7412 with tabulated data presented in Supplementary Material, Table
We identified a missense variant (rs429358 (C158A)) in APOE with an r 2 = 0.48 with rs2075650.
We showed by joint analysis that the association signal at TOMM40 rs2075650 was eliminated when conditioned on APOE rs429358, but the reverse was not true.
This suggests that variation at rs429358 is driving the observed association with hepatic steatosis.
In contrast, another APOE missense variant (rs7412 (C112A)) does not associate with liver steatosis.
The LD between these two missense APOE variants across all populations is low (r 2 < 0.015).
When a joint analysis of rs2075650, rs7412 and rs429358 in UKBB was performed, association results with ALT, a surrogate measure of liver function, were similar to those with rs429358 being more likely causal.
Our findings at rs429358, with respect to hepatic steatosis, are consistent with small case-control studies using a candidate gene approach.
Carriers of the C allele had lower risk of hepatic steatosis whereas carriers of the more common T allele had increased risk of hepatic steatosis by ultrasound, histology or liver enzyme measurement
In UKBB, rs429385-T was associated with increased ALT, liverfat on MRI, NAFLD and cirrhosis.
It was additionally associated with increased BMI, waist circumference, WHRcontBMI, T2D, pancreatitis and cholelithiasis.
This same allele associated with lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and increased levels of HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and apolipoprotein A. Consistent with prior literature, APOE rs429358-T was associated with a lower risk of AD and ischemic heart disease.
Many of these associations were replicated in MGI.
Even after conditioning on rs2075650 and rs7412 in the UKBB, associations with rs429385 continued to be significant except for T2D and pancreatitis.
Our findings demonstrate allelic heterogeneity at APOE as both missense variants associate with different diseases/traits.
Although the variants have similar effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol, ischemic heart disease, AD and C-reactive protein, the variants have opposing effects on hepatic steatosis and serum triglycerides.
In metabolomics studies, rs429358-T has less triglyceride, phospholipid and cholesterol in extra-extralarge, extra-large and large VLDL particles compared to rs7412-T
rs429358-T may promote tissue accumulation of lipids in organs and tissues which may explain why this allele, but not Further, we show how carrying a specific allele is not universally beneficial or harmful.
APOE rs429358-T promotes obesity and tissue retention of triglycerides and cholesterol which may be causally related to development of hepatic steatosis, T2D, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, increased C-reactive protein and cholelithiasis.
This same allele protects against MI and AD.
Whether the protective effect is due to its effects on VLDL composition or some other aspect of its biology is unknown.
rs7412-T also leads to tissue retention of cholesterol which promotes increased C-reactive protein and cholelithiasis but not other diseases and protects against MI and AD.
Since both rs429358-T and rs7412-T promote cholelithiasis and protect against MI and AD these effects are likely due to shared effects.
The observation that carriers of rs429358-T have increased risk of NAFLD but lower risk of AD contrasts with studies reporting that increased NAFLD increases brain dysfunction in both mice and humans.
In mice, wild-type mice fed a chronic highfat diet developed NAFLD and secondary neuroinflammation sufficient to cause neurodegeneration
In cross-sectional analysis of 4472 adults aged 20-59 years from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, NAFLD was independently associated with lower cognitive performance (e.g.
inferior learning, recall and concentration function) independent of CVD and its risk factors
NAFLD has also been associated with reduced brain volume
A recent prospective study showed that altered liver function markers are associated with an AD diagnosis
At the physiological level, insulin resistance plays a major role in both AD and NAFLD
It has been suggested that AD should be regarded as an insulinresistance-mediated neurodegenerative disorder with the same fundamental abnormalities seen in T2D, MetS and NAFLD
Furthermore, the liver is the origin of brain amyloid-deposits, a primary component of the amyloid plaques in AD, and it is involved in peripheral clearance of circulating amyloid beta Aβ in the blood.
ApoE4 inhibits Aβ clearance.
In our study, however, which represents the most powered analyses of hepatic steatosis and its effects on metabolic traits, liver measures and other human diseases, we show that individuals carrying rs429358-T are predisposed to NAFLD but with lower risk of CVD and AD.
This is, to our knowledge, the first report of such an opposite effect of NAFLD, CVD and AD by a single allele.
Genetic effects on the same diseases and traits, even those with shared risk factors and physiology, can differ.
Such differences would depend on the allele effect sizes and frequencies.
rs429358-C explains 13% of AD (31) but <0.25% of variance in liver-fat in UKBB.
Thus, at the population level, many other factors increase risk of both liver-fat and AD.
It is important to note, that almost 40% of those with AD do not carry rs429358-C, and the vast majority of those with AD but without an rs429358-C allele are rs7412-C individuals
In recent mouse studies, ApoE3 (rs429358-T rs7412-C) mice on a high-fat diet accumulated more visceral fat than ApoE4 (rs429358-C rs7412-C) mice on a high-fat diet, consistent with the finding that rs429358-T promotes abdominal obesity
Thus, an allele could protect against AD and CVD yet promote tissue steatosis including in viscera and liver.
APOE is synthesized primarily in the liver, but also in the brain, muscle tissues and the central and peripheral nervous system.
It is an important component of VLDL and a ligand for the LDL receptor.
It also plays an important role in oxidation, neuronal repair, regulation of lipid homeostasis and transport and metabolism of triglycerides and cholesterol.
It has anti-inflammatory functions, skewing the proinflammatory macrophagic phenotype M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 and decreasing synthesis of interleukin-2, and it plays a role in activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes.
Interestingly, both rs429358-T and rs7412-T associate with increased inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein but protect against AD and MI.
Whether this is due to directly promoting macrophage activation in steatotic tissue such as muscle, pancreas and liver to cause development of T2D, pancreatitis and cirrhosis, respectively, while decreasing it in brain and vessels to protect against AD and MI is intriguing.
Other possibilities include that both T alleles promote cholesterol deposition and cellular damage in muscle, pancreas and liver that secondarily leads to inflammation.
Our study has several strengths.
First, we performed a genetic association meta-analysis across the largest set of individuals to date for CT-measured liver attenuation in multiple ancestries.
We showed consistent associations at five loci, including one novel locus, overall and in sex and ethnicity stratified analyses.
Second, we characterize the association of proteincoding genomic variation, which has not been well-studied at the population level, with hepatic steatosis.
Prior studies did not report associations with rs429358 because this variant is not included on arrays and was poorly imputed.
Third, we explore the pleiotropic effects of APOE mutations on a large number of traits through our pheWAS analyses in two biobanks and published GWAS.
Although our study has several strengths, we note some limitations.
First, not all protein-coding variation is cataloged on the exome chip.
Because of purifying selection, disruptive proteincoding variation is rare and would not be found in our studies
Our analysis still demonstrates a paucity of exome-wide associations for hepatic steatosis.
Larger studies could identify associations not seen here.
Since APOE variation is associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, those at highest risk may not have been included in the cohorts studied; however there were only minimal changes in allele frequency across age groups as seen in UKBiobank (Supplementary Material, Fig.
Finally, our results may not be generalizable to other populations and/or other measures of liver function.
This is the largest genetic analysis of liver attenuation to date.
We identified five loci that were exome-wide significant for association with CT-measured liver attenuation, including one new signal at TOMM40/APOE.
We characterize the allelespecific effects at the TOMM40/APOE locus on multiple diseases and traits.
We show for the first time that rs429358-T, which promotes liver steatosis, NAFLD, cirrhosis, diabetes and obesity, is associated with a lower risk of AD, MI, and increased serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides highlighting the context dependent benefits and harms of genetic variation at this locus.
These findings highlight how genetics can identify individuals with a risk profile that differs from the overall population which can help guide future precision health recommendations.

MGI
Study design has been previously described
Briefly, patients at the University of Michigan Health System were recruited on the day of their elective procedure using an opt-in written informed consent for broad long-term use of their electronic health information and genetic data.
Outpatient lab values, diagnoses, demographics and vital signs from individuals seen between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 were included.
For lab measures, all available outpatient lab measures were used to calculate a mean and SD for each trait and each individual.
Outpatient lab measures for an individual were excluded if they were more than 1 SD from the mean to decrease entry errors.
Continuous traits were inverse normally transformed across all individuals measured for a given trait before analysis.
ICD-9 (before 2015) and ICD-10 (after 2015) diagnoses for disease traits were used (Supplementary Material, Table
Diagnosis codes included: NAFLD (ICD-9571.8,
ICD-10 K76.0); NAFLD cirrhosis (ICD-9571.5,
ICD-10 K74 * ); diabetes (ICD-9250 * , ICD-10 E11 * ); AD (ICD-9331.0,ICD-10

Figure 4. Effect of rs2075650, rs429358 and rs7412 on human diseases and traits.
Forest plot showing all associations between the variants and human diseases and traits in the UKBB.
Effects are in SD for continuous traits and log (OR) for disease outcomes per copy of the risk allele.
Levels of significance: P < 0.05.
We used the genotype data of the three variants in UKBB and ran a generalized linear regression model (GLM) to get the betas and P-values shown in the plot, using only unrelated white individuals.
Vertical dotted line indicates and effect size = 0. Significant effect <0 in blue (indicating that the liver-fat promoting allele decreases the effect) and effect size >0 in red (indicating that the liver-fat promoting allele increases the effect), while the traits having nonsignificant effects are shown in black.
ALT: alanine transaminase; LDL: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; TG: triglycerides; APOA: apolipoprotein A; APOB: apolipoprotein B; BP: blood pressure; BMI: body mass index; WHRcontBMI: waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index; T2D: type 2 diabetes.
