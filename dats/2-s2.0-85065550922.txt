Targeting the Iron-Response Elements of the mRNAs for the Alzheimer’s Amyloid Precursor Protein and Ferritin to Treat Acute Lead and Manganese Neurotoxicity
The therapeutic value of inhibiting translation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) offers the possibility to reduce neurotoxic amyloid formation, particularly in cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) caused by APP gene duplications (Dup-APP) and in aging Down syndrome individuals.
APP mRNA translation inhibitors such as the anticholinesterase phenserine, and high throughput screened molecules, selectively inhibited the uniquely folded iron-response element (IRE) sequences in the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) of APP mRNA and this class of drug continues to be tested in a clinical trial as an anti-amyloid treatment for AD.
By contrast, in younger age groups, APP expression is not associated with amyloidosis, instead it acts solely as a neuroprotectant while facilitating cellular ferroportin-dependent iron efflux.
We have reported that the environmental metallotoxins Lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn) cause neuronal death by interfering with IRE dependent translation of APP and ferritin.
The loss of these iron homeostatic neuroprotectants thereby caused an embargo of iron (Fe) export from neurons as associated with excess unstored intracellular iron and the formation of toxic reactive oxidative species (ROS).
We propose that APP 5'UTR directed translation activators can be employed therapeutically to protect neurons exposed to high acute Pb and/or Mn exposure.
Certainly, high potency APP translation activators, exemplified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pre-approved M1 muscarinic agonist AF102B and high throughput-screened APP 5'UTR translation activators, are available for drug development to treat acute toxicity caused by Pb/Mn exposure to neurons.
We conclude that APP translation activators can be predicted to prevent acute metal toxicity to neurons by a mechanism related to the 5'UTR specific yohimbine which binds and targets the canonical IRE RNA stem loop as an H-ferritin translation activator.

Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Translation Inhibitors for Anti-Amyloid Efficacy in Down Syndrome and Familial Alzheimer's Disease
1.1.
APP Gene Dose in Down Syndrome and in Rare Cases of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (fAD)
We review how blocking translation of the mRNA encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP) using a validated target to decrease its translational expression
Conversely, activators of translation of this APP transcript can be used to shield neurons from acute toxicity from heavy 2 of 16 metal exposure.
The approach to limit APP translation can be viewed as a useful anti-amyloid strategy especially in older Down syndrome (DS) individuals, over age 40, who express three copies of the chromosome 21 gene set (including APP) and who suffer an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like dementia confounded often by epileptic seizures
Trisomy of the APP gene can be genetically reverted to diploid levels to slow down the features of amyloidosis in DS mouse models
In this section of the article, we outline our approach to inhibit APP expression via the 5'UTR of its transcript.
Rare forms of fAD are the result of genetic duplication of the APP gene to increase dose of the Aβ-precursor, as observed in DS
In cases of fAD caused by Dup-APP, it has been reported that hemorrhaging is more frequent than in elderly DS subjects
Pertinent to this therapeutic scenario, it is often overlooked that APP facilitates neuroprotective iron export by the universal iron export protein ferroportin
Thus, there exists a distinct potential role for APP in neurons to maintain iron homeostasis that has yet to be fully characterized before executing an anti-amyloid strategy.
This paper described the interaction between iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) in conjunction with miR-346 to bind and modulate the activity of the 5'UTR of APP-mRNA with implications for its role when iron interfaces with neural levels of APP and amyloidosis in AD
IRP1 and IRP2 are the recognized RNA binding proteins that control iron homeostasis in the periphery and in terms of cell growth
Mounting reports show that APP itself binds to ferroportin to facilitate blood brain barrier iron export as well as iron efflux for from metal burdened neurons
The use of small molecule APP translation blockers will be described in the following sections to list their common properties as therapeutic agents that can remediate the consequences of either too much APP expression as in DS patients (Section 1)
The later likely occurs in acute conditions of environmental exposure to toxic lead (Pb) and manganese (Mn) to affected neurons of exposed children
Certainly, triplication (i.e., the presence of three copies) of chromosome 21 in Down syndrome increases APP gene abundance and also the occurrence of clinical amyloidosis and dementia based on the classical amyloid/tau phosphorylation pathway
We would note, based on APP's iron export function
In such circumstances of APP over-expression, pharmacological uses of APP translation blockers may provide added clinical efficacy to prevent excess APP/FPN-1 dependent Fe efflux and thus restore iron balance at the same time as generating anti-amyloid efficacy.
For example, the drugs phenserine and posiphen, as known APP translation inhibitors, limit Aβ levels in neural cell lines
Posiphen is undergoing clinical trials as an APP translation blocker that generates anti-amyloid efficacy

APP 5'Untranslated Region Translation Blockers as Anti-Amyloid Agents In Vivo
We reported that translational control events generated both by inflammation
The APP 5'UTR is a uniquely folded RNA structure that is related, though distinct from, the functional IRE in the transcript of the iron storage protein ferritin, though it is base paired in a unique RNA architecture
While there is evidence for a spectrum of IRE like homologies in neurodegenerative disease transcripts
Phenserine and its enantiomer posiphen are each in the class of APP 5'UTR directed drugs that were first identified using transfection-based studies to inhibit APP in cell culture
Phenserine and posiphen both were shown to generate anti-amyloid efficacy in primary neurons and in humans (Table

Disappointingly, however, phenserine failed phase III clinical trials for AD because of its placebo effect
Nevertheless, the enantiomer posiphen is in current phase II clinical trials as an APP 5'UTR inhibitor that limits levels of brain, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ amyloid

High Throughput Screen for APP 5'UTR Inhibitors for Anti-Amyloid Efficacy
Encouraged by our findings that clinical drugs generated APP 5'UTR directed anti-amyloid activity to provide an in vivo validation of this RNA sequence as a therapeutic target, we high throughput screened this same RNA stem loop with non-overlapping collections of 90,000 small molecules from compound libraries at Harvard University
We employed western blot secondary experimental analyses to short-list 13 highly potent 5'UTR-directed APP translation blockers in SH-SY5Y cells (Table
All were planar, tri-cyclic molecules, and harbored benzimidazole rings
One of the most active leads was the ninth compound in the series, APP blocker-9 ("JTR-009") that selectively suppressed APP expression while maintaining alpha-secretase dependent APP(s) secretion from primary cortical neurons as well as in SH-SY5Y cells (Table
When considering the anti-amyloid therapeutic use of agents to limit APP translation, we will in the future incorporate into the model the fact that the loss of APP inside the neurons is predicted to reduce the capacity of cells to export iron.
Use of any translation inhibitor of APP should result in an embargo of iron export from neurons by the APP-FPN-1 complex.
This should indeed reflect cellular exposures to toxic heavy metals such as Pb and Mn which eliminate APP and ferritin from neurons, an event that caused a redox positive embargo of iron export and toxic Fe buildup with accompanying ferroptosis
This new facet will now be incorporated into experimental protocols when medicinally developing agents such as JTR-009
This new class of APP translation inhibitors may, in fact, be considered most suitable to treat the orphan disease of APP-trisomy that causes the Dup-APP (hemorrhagic AD) as a form of fAD and also for cases of amyloidosis with complications in DS patients over 40 years of age.
Individuals suffering from Dup-APP and DS are associated with increased APP levels and have yet to be investigated for localized anemia in affected neurons.
Here, APP 5'UTR directed inhibitors would be expected to potentially restore diploid APP levels, and hence recalibrate cells for loss of Fe, rather than simply to generate anti-amyloid efficacy

APP 5'UTR Activators Shield Neurons from Acute Pb/Mn Disruption of Fe-Homeostasis

Heavy Metal Neurotoxicity by Loss of IRE/IRP Translation of APP and Ferritin-H Chain
As a rationale, acute, immediate-term Pb toxicity is an exposure risk for children that causes neurodevelopmental delays, autism, and behavioral problems
By comparison, occupational exposure to excess manganese (Mn) causes "manganism", a psychiatric and motor disturbance related to Parkinson's disease (PD), revealing also perturbed physiological Fe flow from the blood to cerebral spinal fluid
Like Pb, Mn neurotoxicity was shown to disrupt translation of APP whose intracellular loss prevented acute neuronal iron export by ferroportin (FPN)
In fact both Pb and Mn interfered with IRE conferred control of translation of APP such that its loss from cells caused an embargo of redox active intracellular iron, an event that appeared to cause neuronal death by ferroptosis
In addition to inhibiting APP/ferroportin levels to embargo iron export, Mn also selectively inhibited translation of L-and H-subunits of ferritin, which is the central neuroprotective iron storage multimer in all cells of the body
In this section, we will discuss how, while amyloid Aβ accumulation is neurotoxic in aging adults suffering from AD, nevertheless the full-length APP and secreted APP(s) is neurotrophic in younger individuals
APP(s) was shown to combat metal-toxicity to neurons
Ferritin (FtH) is the body's central iron storage protein while APP has a critical role to bind to ferroportin to promote FPN dependent iron export from brain neurons
We reported that cultured SH-SY5Y neural cells exposed to Pb and Mn exhibited compromised neuronal cell viability, resulting from disruption of iron export and thus increases in the labile iron pool following interference with Fe export and storage as would normally occur for APP and ferritin expression
Both metals inhibited translation of ferritin and APP as central iron homeostatic proteins by targeting the IRE RNA stem loops in the 5'UTRs of their mRNAs
In sum, there exists a pathway whereby Pb and Mn interfered with ferritin and APP translation via their 5'UTR specific IREs to eliminate the presence of these proteins in neurons, sufficient to undermine their iron storage, export, and neuroprotective function
This caused neuronal cell death.
Such a toxicity was a primed event generated by an embargo of iron transport and prevention of its storage, an event that increased cellular redox and neuronal death from reactive oxygen species (ROS).
These events are known to be accelerated by iron catalysis of hydroxyl radical formation by the Fenton reaction and are associated with ferroptosis

Activation of Ferritin and APP Translation to Protect Neurons from Mn/Pb Exposure
To support a therapeutic intervention to prevent Pb and Mn toxicity to neurons, APP over-expression is a proven genetic means to efflux excess embargoed iron and APP over expression indeed provided protection to neurons exposed to these metals
For this reason, there is strong rationale for our strategy to pharmacologically induce APP translation and APP(s) secretion to counteract Pb and Mn generated toxicity in vulnerable neurons during increases in toxic metal exposure
We propose the therapeutic model shown in Figure
This strategy is applicable for patients before an age of increased risk for the onset of amyloidosis.
Mouse models demonstrated that pre-and postnatal exposure to Pb is associated with increased risk for amyloidosis and AD specific cognitive deficiencies later in life, though this is not the case at the time of Pb exposure
This model has not been tested in Mn exposed rodent models.
In the next section we will describe how the use of APP translation activators such as the m1 muscarinic acid AF10B are attractive candidates in circumstances while such agents are also co-activators of alpha-secretases, thus eliminating the risk of amyloidosis when pharmacologically increasing the intracellular presence of APP template.
There is a strong rationale for the use of small molecules that can restore IRE/IRP dependent APP translation in order to increase intracellular APP and APP(s) as a part of a neuroprotective response to shield neurons from heavy metal neurotoxicity.
Any agents that increase APP expression can be predicted to potentially enhance ferroportin activity and to subsequently expel excess embargoed intracellular iron generated in brain neurons after exposure to high doses of Pb and/or Mn.

The Neuroprotective M1 Muscarinic Agonist AF102B, Which Induces Alpha-Secretase, Is an APP 5'UTR Directed Activator
From a chemical viewpoint, (±)-cis-2-methyl-spiro(1,3-oxathiolane-5,3 ) quinuclidine (AF102B) was a proven M1 agonist that attenuated cognitive dysfunction in AF64A-treated rats
Such M1 muscarinic agonists appear to be disease-modifying agents in AD
AF102B was shown to generate enhanced neuroprotective APP, likely resulting from alpha-secretase activation of the non-amyloidogenic and neuroprotective pathway of APP expression
We reported that this M1 muscarinic agonist confers neuroprotection while inducing APP translation as well as activating alpha-secretase to generate increased secretion of APP(s) from neural cell lines

This exemplifies a class of drug that activates APP 5'UTR to translate higher levels of APP as a neuroprotectant, a property that may explain its pro-cognitive functions while also generating anti amyloid efficacy via alpha-secretase

Alternative to Iron Chelation: Novel High Throughput Screened APP Translation Activators in a Mode of Therapeutic Shielding of Neurons from Intracellular Fe Buildup After Pb and Mn Exposure
Based on our findings with AF102B, in contrast to phenserine, we predicted that it would be practical to screen and develop novel activators of APP mRNA translation for the purposes of preventing IRE/IRP dependent loss of this key iron export protein in neurons after exposure to acute high dose Mn and Pb toxicity (Table
In fact, small molecule APP 5'UTR directed activators are listed as a result of our high throughput screening campaign conducted at the Columbia University medical center (PUBCHEM AID 1276) and each of these listed agents can theoretically be developed medicinally to restore loss of APP during Pb and Mn exposure.
In this event, the iron efflux capacity of cells can be restored to maintain a healthy labile iron pool, which had been lost under conditions where ferritin and APP translation had been blocked after Pb and/or Mn exposure
To sum up, short-term Pb exposure, like that of Mn, was shown to block iron export thereby preventing both APP and ferritin translation.
This embargoed iron export increased the labile iron pool (LIP) and caused increased neurotoxic reactive oxygen intermediates (ROS) and neuronal death.
Such events may be
We propose the use of small molecules screened to activate APP 5'UTR directed translation and can be medicinally developed to improve neuronal survival from Pb and Mn toxicity
Chelation has in the past offered the most direct route to treat Mn and Pb exposed patients
We will list examples of chelation therapy below and also provide a second line of therapeutic intervention which became apparent since we identified a series of small molecule APP 5'UTR activators.
These small molecules could offset Pb's and Mn's toxic activity as de-stabilizers of neural viability via IRE dependent translational pathways of APP and ferritin translation in prone neurons (Table
Traditionally iron chelators are widely regarded as useful agents to treat conditions of iron overload such as β-thalassemia while having been proven useful for AD
Indeed, there are innumerable advantages supporting the hypothesis for a metal basis for both AD and PD in reference to molecules that serve as scavengers of biometals, such as clioquinol, or molecules that interfere in numerous dysfunctions and pathophysiological changes caused by heavy metals
An early milestone study by

Our collaborative work in the model in Figure
This model proposes that APP 5'UTR directed activators could generate conditions of intracellular iron efflux from neurons that have been metal (Fe) burdened (Table
Of note, in as much as iron surplus is dangerous to neurons, iron deficiency also can alter the expression of genes implicated in AD pathogenesis
Iron deficiency in the hippocampus alters the co-operation between neurons in connectomes between developing memory systems; thus, in this system, clearly individual APP inhibitors/activators should be developed to restore intracellular iron balance towards normal homeostatic levels
In conclusion, both activators and inhibitors of iron homeostasis can be applied depending on the local conditions of iron in any given clinical circumstance of too much or too little iron.
In the case of clinical metal over-exposures, APP and ferritin activators can be developed to re-establish iron homeostasis as accelerated by neuronal ablation from iron overload during the course of metal exposures and even during AD.

Model for APP Translation Activators to Shield Neurons from Pb and Mn Neurotoxicity
We recognize that APP 5'UTR is an mRNA target for translation blockers such as the anti-cholinesterase phenserine and its enantiomer posiphen, each being of sufficient interest to merit clinical trials for their action as anti-amyloid agents in older subjects at risk for AD
By contrast AF102B is a neuroprotective M1 muscarinic agonist in use to treat Sjogren's syndrome which has been shown to induce APP(s) secretion resulting from alpha-secretase activation of the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP expression
We found AF102B to be an APP 5'UTR dependent translation activator that we propose represents an encouraging starting point for medicinal treatment of acute Pb and Mn toxicity to exposed brain neurons (i.e., in the younger population suffering from environmental/industrial heavy metal exposures long before the onset of an amyloidogenic cascade of AD).
The model in Figure
In this clinical scenario, APP activators such as AF102B and high throughput screened counterparts should be predicted to promote iron efflux by ferroportin when heavy metals generate a redox active iron embargo to affected cells after eliminating neuroprotective APP, APP(s), and ferritin translation

Activators of the Ferritin-H Chain 5'UTR Specific IRE to Shield Neurons from Acute Pb/Mn Disruption of Fe-Homeostasis
The natural product from the indole alkaloid derived from the bark of the Pausinystalia yohimbe tree in Central Africa is the source of the antioxidant and anti-arthritic agent commonly known as yohimbine
This natural product is a pre-synaptic alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent that promotes male potency (PUBCHEM CID 8969).
Induction of ferritin subunit translation is a cellular strategy to promote intracellular iron storage to prevent Fe catalyzed redox and ferroptosis while advancing cellular viability and oxidative health in endothelial cells
In the presence of yohimbine, the rate of biosynthesis of ferritin in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was observed to be increased by 40% while this action was supported by a similar increase in synthesis of luciferase protein in a chimera of the IRE and luciferase gene.
This identification of yohimbine as a small drug-like molecule that recognizes a naturally occurring IRE in the three-dimensional mRNA structure of ferritin mRNA raises the possibility to develop this agent and others to upregulate ferritin biosynthesis and prevent Fe catalyzed injury thereby preventing ferroptotic toxic injury to neurons following their exposure to heavy metals such as Pb
We demonstrated that Mn and Pb not only eliminated APP from SH-SY5Y model neurons
These actions were also evident in rodent models
It is possible to employ ferritin translation activators such as yohimbine as therapeutic agents to confer protective action in preventing iron overload to neurons affected by Mn and Pb toxic exposure.
The natural product yohimbine is a candidate to counter-activate any interference with IRE dependent translation of ferritin L-and H-chains in order to protect affected cells
Related to the action of yohimbine, we identified a novel benzimidazole designated BL-1 from a high throughput screen against the 5'UTR of the prion protein (PrP) transcript (Table
BL-1 was originally selected as a means to limit scrapie formation and transmissible encephalopathies (PUBCHEM AID 48862).
Nevertheless, PrP had already been shown to regulate iron transport by functioning as a ferro-reductase in human cells
Thus, it was a serendipitous finding when BL-1 showed target selectivity to modulate both PrP and H-ferritin expression (data no shown).
To account for this, as well as both proteins conferring iron homeostatic functions, we demonstrated that the 5'untranslated regions in each mRNA demonstrated 78% sequence homology as alternate and unique versions of the IRE that modulates iron dependent translation (Figure
Western blot and cell viability data supports that BL-1 activates expression of the H-subunit of the iron storage protein ferritin which is a known cytoplasmic neurotrophin
This is the case also for its mitochondrial variant, mitoferrin
Cytosolic ferritin over-expression has protected mice from MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine) lesioning
Others have emphasized the protective role of mitochondrial ferritin on erastin-induced ferroptosis
Mitoferrin favorably modulates iron toxicity in a Drosophila model of Friedreich's ataxia
Like the natural product yohimbine, BL-1 will be further tested to translationally activate IRE dependent translation of ferritin L-and H-chains

Conclusions
Pharmacological lowering of APP levels is appropriate when associated with anti-amyloid efficacy and when excess APP is present in rare trisomy APP mutants of AD
APP translation blockers are a suitable therapy for forms of AD formed by excess APP in trisomic chromosome 21 dose conditions.
Conversely, we discussed that cases of acute high dose short term Pb and Mn poisoning to neurons would benefit from the use of APP activators, sufficient to restore intracellular APP-FPN-1 dependent Fe and metal export and thus improve viability in such affected cells.
There is a place for discovering novel agents, capable of adjusting and normalizing brain neuronal APP levels in order to both control amyloid but also to restore and optimize brain iron balance from a toxic iron dys/homeostasis such as during acute Pb/Mn toxicity.
Modulation of APP and ferritin translation is a clear means to restore the labile iron pools that have been increased after Pb/Mn exposure has interfered with both ferritin L-and H-chains and APP mRNA translation.
