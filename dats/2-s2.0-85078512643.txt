Neuron-glia interaction through Serotonin-BDNF-NGFR axis enables regenerative neurogenesis in Alzheimer’s model of adult zebrafish brain
It was recently suggested that supplying the brain with new neurons could counteract Alzheimer's disease (AD).
This provocative idea requires further testing in experimental models in which the molecular basis of disease-induced neuronal regeneration could be investigated.
We previously found that zebrafish stimulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity and neurogenesis in AD and could help to understand the mechanisms to be harnessed for developing new neurons in diseased mammalian brains.
Here, by performing single-cell transcriptomics, we found that amyloid toxicity-induced interleukin-4 (IL4) promotes NSC proliferation and neurogenesis by suppressing the tryptophan metabolism and reducing the production of serotonin.
NSC proliferation was suppressed by serotonin via down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expression in serotonin-responsive periventricular neurons.
BDNF enhances NSC plasticity and neurogenesis via nerve growth factor receptor A (NGFRA)/ nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NFkB) signaling in zebrafish but not in rodents.
Collectively, our results suggest a complex neuron-glia interaction that regulates regenerative neurogenesis after AD conditions in zebrafish.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) entails versatile pathological changes such as synaptic degeneration, neuronal death, chronic inflammation, impaired vasculature function, and reduced plasticity of neural stem cells (NSCs)
The cognitive decline that is observed in AD patients and experimental animal models is mainly caused by the reduced neural network integrity
The efforts to rescue the cognitive decline and neuronal death traditionally largely focused on the neuronal compartment and aimed at preventing the death of the neurons, but this has not yielded in desired success in clinics
An alternative approach was suggested to complement the treatment in neuronal compartments by increasing the production of new neurons to provide resilience and strength to the diseased circuitry
Yet, neurogenesis in human brains is rather controversial
Although many reports documented the presence of adult neurogenesis in humans
Additionally, in AD conditions, mammalian NSCs reduce the proliferative ability dramatically, and for neurogenesis to become a viable option for treatment of neurological disorders, mammalian NSCs must become plastic first.
Therefore, examining how NSCs could be made proliferative and neurogenic during the course of AD could provide important clinical ramifications toward the treatment of this disease
Recently, we established a zebrafish model, which can recapitulate the symptoms of AD in humans, such as neuronal death, synaptic degeneration, chronic inflammation, and cognitive decline
Interestingly, in contrast to humans, the zebrafish brain could enhance NSC proliferation and neurogenesis through a previously unidentified neuroimmune regulation involving Interleukin-4 (IL4).
IL4 secreted by dying neurons activated microglia, which in turn activated NSC proliferation
We also found that IL4 could revert the pathological effects on NSC in an in vitro 3D reductionist model of AD
Yet, the mechanisms by which IL4 regulates NSC proliferation and neurogenesis after amyloid toxicity remained unknown.
In this manuscript, using single-cell sequencing, we identified a previously undocumented IL4-dependent mechanism that regulates NSC plasticity in the adult zebrafish brain, by which IL4 regulates production of serotonin, which suppresses production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in periventricular neurons juxtaposing the NSCs.
We found that BDNF is required to activate NSC plasticity, proliferation of NSCs, and neurogenesis through its receptor nerve growth factor receptor A (NGFRA), the blockage of which reduces NSC proliferation.
Overall, our results identify a mechanism by which IL4 regulates NSC plasticity through serotonin-dependent expression of BDNF in neurons in the zebrafish brain and demonstrate functional heterogeneity of NSCs based on receptor expression.
Our results will provide a conceptual basis for neuro-immune regulation of NSCs, neuronal control of NSC proliferation, and differential response of NSC subtypes to various signals in zebrafish.
Such understanding could be instrumental in the efforts to develop novel therapies for AD through increased neurogenesis.

Results
To determine the effects of IL4 on NSC plasticity in the adult zebrafish brain, we administered IL4 through cerebroventricular microinjection, dissected the telencephalon at 1 day post injection (dpi), separated the her4.1:
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive NSCs from GFP-negative cells, and performed whole-transcriptome profiling in control and IL4-injected brains for both of these cell populations (Fig 1A, S1 Data).
When we compared the gene expression profiles in GFP-negative cell populations that contain non-NSC cell types, including the neurons and immune cells, we found that IL4 administration increased the expression of 285 genes and down-regulated 1,435 genes (Fig 1B, S1 Data).
To determine the pathways affected by IL4, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses and observed that one of the significantly regulated pathways was tryptophan metabolism
Specifically, we observed that the enzymes generating serotonin from tryptophan were down-regulated (Fig 1D, S2 Data), suggesting that IL4 might reduce the production of serotonin (5-HT).
To test whether amyloid-beta42 (Aβ42, which induces IL4 expression
We found that Aβ42 or IL4 does not induce the death of 5-HT cells because the cell bodies of serotonergic cells present in superior raphe region are intact and are not, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive after Aβ42 or IL4 treatment (S2 Fig) .
These results demonstrate that Aβ42 and IL4 suppress serotonin production rather than the innervation.
Additionally, the effects of IL4 is specific to serotonergic system, because in our deep sequencing analyses we did not observe changes in KEGG analyses in other neurotransmitter pathways, such as dopamine, histamine, or noradrenalin (S2 Data).
Because Aβ42/IL4 enhances NSC proliferation in the adult zebrafish brain
To test this, we injected 5-HT into the adult zebrafish brain and analyzed the proliferation of NSCs (S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100β) and and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) double positive cells) at 1 dpi (Fig 2A
We observed a significant reduction (reduced by 32%) of NSC proliferation after 5-HT injection (Fig
This reduction has implications in neurogenesis from NSCs, because the analysis of 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled newborn neurons at 14 dpi of PBS (Fig
Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether 5-HT would affect the same subset of NSCs or whether it affects a distinct population.
To determine whether or not 5-HT has a direct effect on NSCs, we determined the spatial organization of NSCs (her4.
This further confirms that serotonin is indeed affecting periventricular neurons but not NSCs in the adult zebrafish brain.
Among the serotonin receptor genes, htr1a was expressed only in ventral regions (Fig 2L
These findings suggested that the effect of 5-HT on NSCs is not direct, and it could be mediated through periventricular neurons expressing htr1d (Fig
If 5-HT would act on periventricular neurons, 5-HT would activate its downstream effector phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)
Indeed, we found that compared with controls in which nuclear pERK is in few cells at the periventricular zone (PVZ) (Fig 2O ), 5-HT injection increases the number of pERK+ nuclei (by 37%) only in the PVZ region
Quantification of pERK+ nuclei also confirmed that 5-HT increases To determine the mechanistic link between 5-HT and NSC plasticity through hrt1+ cells (Fig 2P ), we performed single-cell transcriptomics in control and 5-HT-treated adult zebrafish telencephalon by unbiased clustering, determination of cell types and differential gene expression analyses using the methodology we have recently developed
According to this analysis, if BDNF had a potential interaction between neuronal and glial (progenitor) clusters, we would see an in silico interaction between these cells.
Alternatively, if ntrk2 or ngfra could constitute a crosstalk between neuronal and glial clusters, we would be able to see an interaction (see Cosacak and colleagues
For interaction analyses, we used the spatial organization map of adult zebrafish NSCs in the telencephalon (Fig
After these analyses, we found that especially 2 clusters of progenitor cells (PC0 and PC2, which are located to dorsal and medial region of the telencephalon; Fig 3F and Cosacak and colleagues
Interestingly, the majority of the potential interactions were newly generated after amyloid or IL4 treatment, whereas those interactions are mainly lost after 5-HT treatment (Fig 3G, green circles), suggesting that the regulation of progenitor cells (NSCs) by bdnf could be promoted by amyloid or IL4 treatment and suppressed by 5-HT, which is consistent with our hypothesis.
Additionally, to support our findings, we performed independent mapping analyses of bdnf receptors ntrk2 and ngfra.
We constructed interaction maps for these receptors and found that ngfra might be the main receptor for bdnf signaling in adult zebrafish telencephalon because 2 NSC clusters (PC0 and PC2) were at the center of the interaction maps with many potential interactions (Fig
To test this, we injected BDNF into adult zebrafish brains (Fig 4D
The enhanced proliferation of NSCs by BDNF is also translated into increased neurogenesis because BDNF-injected brains produce more neurons (increase by 19%) compared with control-injected zebrafish brains (Fig 4F
If BDNF would act directly on NSCs, its receptor must have been present in the target cells.
Therefore, we performed ISH for ntrk2 and ngfra in adult zebrafish brains.
We observed that ntrk2 mRNA is expressed mainly in the periventricular region of the telencephalon (  that ngfra is the primary receptor for bdnf in NSCs and ntrk2 is the primary receptor in neurons.
To test this hypothesis, we injected BDNF into the adult zebrafish brain and determined the downstream effectors of NTRK2 and NGFRA signaling pathways.
To determine the cells responding to BDNF/NTRK2 signaling, we detected the downstream effector phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt)
On the contrary, compared with control-injected brains, BDNF injection increased the activity of the NFkB reporter
Additionally, consistent with our previous result, we observed that at 1 dpi, NFkB signaling and the number of NFkB-positive proliferating NSCs (S100β /PCNA/NFkB:GFP-triple positive cells) increased by 47% after BDNF injection, 28% after Aβ42 injection, and 25% after IL4 injection but reduced by 10% after 5-HT injection (S6 Fig) .
These results indicate that NGFR-mediated intracellular signaling is the primary route for the 5-HT-dependent BDNF activity on NSCs in the adult zebrafish brain.
If our hypothesis was true and BDNF would regulate NSC proliferation through NGFRA and NFkB signaling, knocking-down the ngfra receptor after BDNF injection would suppress the increase in NSC proliferation by BDNF as well as the increase in NFkB signaling.
To test this hypothesis, we knocked down ngfra by using morpholino oligonucleotides and determined the extent of proliferating NSCs (Fig 5A
Compared with control brains, BDNF increased the NSC proliferation by 38%; control morpholino did not alter this increase (remained 37% increase) whereas ngfra morpholino diminished (reduced down to 13%) the increased NSC proliferation upon BDNF injection (Fig
Because BDNF/NGFRA signaling is affected by IL4 that also acts directly on NSCs through IL4R
To determine whether IL4R-positive and NGFRA-positive NSCs are distinct subtypes of NSCs in adult zebrafish brain, we plotted both cell populations on the same tSNE plot (Fig 5C ).
We observed that only 3.2% of ngfra-positive NSCs were also il4r1-positive (24.5% are only il4r-positive and 72.3% are only ngfra-positive), indicating that these 2 populations are likely to represent 2 functional subtypes of NSCs.
We further hypothesized that if ngfra-positive and il4r-positive NSCs would constitute different subtypes, their response to particular treatments would also lead to distinct differential gene expression profiles.
To address this question, we determined the overlap between differentially expressed genes in il4r-positive and ngfra-positive NSCs (Fig
We determined that, after IL4 treatment, 423 and 895 genes are differentially expressed in il4r+ (S5 Data) and ngfra+ (S6 Data) NSCs, respectively (Fig
Only 14% of the DEGs are common in these cell populations whereas the rest are differentially expressed in only one of the cell types (Fig
Similarly, after BDNF treatment, ngfra knockdown reduced the number of proliferating NSCs where NFkB signaling is active (Fig 5F
These results indicate that neuron-glia interaction through BDNF regulates NSC proliferation and neurogenesis through NGFRA/NFkB signaling (Fig
To explore the evolutionary conservation of our findings in healthy and AD conditions, we determined the expression of BDNF, NTRK2, and p75/NTR (NGFRA ortholog in mouse) in wild-type mouse and APP/PS1dE9 AD model (S7-S9 Figs).
Compared with 12-month-old control mouse brains, age-matched APP/PS1dE9 mouse displayed reduced SOX2 (neurogenic competency and NSC maintenance marker
Overall, NTRK2 is expressed mainly by neurons but also few astrocytes and microglia (S8 Fig) .
We found that p75/NTR is mainly expressed in neurons in the cortex and the DG, but NSC niche in the DG (subgranular zone[(SGZ)]) does not express p75/NTR (S7 Fig,
In both wildtype and APP/PS1dE9 mouse, we could detect BDNF, NTRK2, and p75/NTR expression; however, increased number of GFAP-positive astrocytes AD brains did not correlate with the expression of these proteins, suggesting that BDNF signaling might not regulate NSC proliferation in mouse brains.
To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of BDNF in wild-type and AD mouse brains by injecting BDNF into the mouse brains (S7 Fig,
BDNF injection was performed in one hemisphere of the mouse brain, whereas the other hemisphere was used as a control with PBS injection.
We found that BDNF injection increased the overall proliferation In addition, we also checked the cell types that increase their proliferation levels.
To identify the BDNF-responsive proliferating cells, we performed co-staining with astrocyte marker GFAP and found that the cells positive for Ki67 (antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki-67, a marker for proliferating cells) are GFAP negative, suggesting that BDNFresponsive proliferating cells are not astrocytes (S7 Fig,
Additionally, because of the lack of p75/NTR expression in NSCs present in the SGZ of the mouse hippocampus, BDNF/p75NTR signaling, which enhances proliferative output of NSCs and neurogenesis in zebrafish brain, is not an active signaling mechanism in mouse brains.
With these results, we propose that zebrafish utilizes special circuit mechanism that uses serotonin-BDNF signaling to enhance the NSC plasticity and to induce neurogenesis through neuronal intermediates; however, BDNF signaling is not regulating NSC plasticity and neurogenesis in mammalian brains whereas its effect is mainly on the neuronal survival and regulation of immune reaction

Discussion
Our results identify a previously uncharacterized regulatory circuit mechanism that involves neuronal intermediates for NSC plasticity of zebrafish brain in AD conditions.
This mechanism involves the suppressive effect of serotonin on periventricular neurons that express bdnf, which directly regulates a subset of NSCs expressing BDNF receptor ngfra.
amyloid-induced IL4 suppresses the initial serotonergic output and therefore potentiates the bdnf expression and stem-cell proliferation.
We propose that induced expression of IL4 generates a diseaseassociated NSC niche environment that is supportive of NSC proliferation.
Serotonin affects neurogenesis, stem-cell proliferation, and normal functioning of neural circuitry; however, its effects on NSCs and neurogenesis are controversial
In zebrafish, serotonin positively affects NSC proliferation in midbrain but not the hypothalamus
Although depletion of serotonin reduces adult neurogenic outcome in rats
In mesencephalic and hippocampal progenitors of mouse brain, inhibition of serotonin receptors or knocking out serotonin-producing enzymes to generate hyposerotonergic phenotypes had positive effects on neurogenesis
These findings indicate that the effects of serotonin on NSCs are context dependent and may run through intermediary secondary signaling mechanisms, which supports our findings.
Additionally, in the majority of the studies, the specific receptors for serotonin were not investigated in NSCs; therefore, our study provides a detailed delineation of the signaling cascades that link serotonergic input to the regulation of stem cell proliferation via intermediates in our study by BDNF.
The interaction between serotonin and BDNF is partially understood.
In stress-related disorders, depletion of serotonin reduces brain BDNF levels
On the contrary, hyposerotonergic mouse (Tph2-/-or Pet1-/-) showed increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
Our findings support the negative role of serotonin on BDNF signaling and NSC plasticity.
The effects of BDNF in AD are mainly on neuronal survival rather than neurogenesis or NSC plasticity.
Although BDNF expression correlates with increased neuronal survival
In fact, in a recent study, in 5X-FAD AD model of mice, increasing adult neurogenesis and simultaneous BDNF treatment increases cognitive output yet adult neurogenesis or BDNF alone are not sufficient to do so
In zebrafish, in contrast to mammals, BDNF directly regulates NSC plasticity and neurogenesis.
Our results in APP/PS1dE9 mice also supported the findings in mice
BDNF expression is abundant in mammalian brains
BDNF also has binding affinity towards p75 receptor, which is primarily expressed by neurons in mammals
Yet, in zebrafish, ngfra was predominantly expressed in NSCs and were responsible for NSC plasticity.
Zebrafish glial cells responded to BDNF via ngfra receptor and activated proliferation and neurogenesis; whereas, mouse glial cells responded to BDNF by reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis.
Therefore, our results also propose that the BDNF activity could be specialized to distinct receptor signaling pathways in vertebrate brains.
For instance, BDNF-NGFRA signaling could be a factor underlying the regenerative and plastic nature of the NSCs in regenerating organisms such as zebrafish but not in nonregenerating organisms like mammals, in which BDNF mostly acts through TrkB/Ntrk2 signaling.
Further studies of this regulatory mechanism in other regenerating organisms would be instrumental in testing our hypothesis.
Furthermore, inducing expression of ngfra in stem-cell populations in mammalian brains could be a potential way to impose neurogenic plasticity to astrocytes in AD conditions.
We found that IL4 suppresses the serotonin production in neurons that do not express il4r, suggesting that IL4 regulates serotonin availability indirectly.
Indeed, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNFα, IFNα, and IFNγ can increase 5-HT levels and the expression of 5-HT transporter SERT, which positively correlates with 5-HT levels in the brain
Theoretically, anti-inflammatory factors would be expected to reduce 5-HT levels in the brain because of their role in suppression of proinflammatory factor expression.
Indeed, IL4 reduces the 5-HT or SERT levels
Therefore, in the adult zebrafish brain, AD conditions elicit an inflammatory regulation by IL4 on serotonin, which translates into a neurotransmitter response in a specific neuronal subtype that directly regulates a subpopulation of NSCs.
We identified 2 functionally distinct populations of NSCs that are both responsive to IL4 but through different receptor signaling (IL4R/STAT6 and BDNF/NGFRA) and through distinct gene regulation (Fig 5D
This finding suggests that NSC heterogeneity is an important determinant of how a certain type of neuropathology and a particular signaling pathway would affect certain subtypes of cells differentially (e.g., in AD conditions, the regulation of proliferation by IL4 in 2 distinct modes [
This understanding would be instrumental in designing targeted therapy options for AD in humans and may lead to more detailed analyses of NSC subtypes in experimental mammalian models of AD.
Additionally, the role of IL4 and serotonin in regulating diverse signaling mechanisms in NSCs opens up interesting research avenues as to whether modulation of neuroinflammatory milieu in mammalian brains would kick-start a "regeneration" response by mobilizing the endogenous reservoir of NSCs, which is a controversial subject
We propose that zebrafish can be used to address neurogenesis-related questions in disease conditions and could serve as a useful experimental model for investigating the molecular mechanisms of NSC plasticity.

For all BrdU-chase experiments, fish were sacrificed at 14 dpi, and brain samples were subjected to histological preparations.

Zebrafish tissue preparation, IHC and ISH
Zebrafish were sacrificed at appropriate time points, the heads were dissected, and subjected for overnight fixation at 4˚C using 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
For cryoprotection and decalcification, the heads were incubated in 20% Sucrose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) / 20% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) solution overnight at 4˚C.
The following day, heads were embedded in cryoprotectant sectioning resin in 20% Sucrose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) / 7.5% Gelatin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and stored at -80˚C.
These samples were cryosectioned into 12-μm thick sections using a cryostat and collected onto glass slides which were then stored at -20˚C.
For IHC, the sections were dried at room temperature, followed by washing steps in PBS with 0.03% Triton X-100 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (PBSTx).
The slides were then incubated overnight in desired primary antibodies at 4˚C.

BDNF injection into adult mouse brain
For the mouse experiment, 100 ng of BDNF (1 μl, 100μg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was injected into one hemisphere of the adult mouse brain, and the other hemisphere was injected with 1 μl PBS as a control.
The injection procedure was carried out according to the previously established protocol
The mouse was placed in an induction chamber and anesthetized using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) flow.
After the animal was recumbent, the gas flow directed to the nosecone of the stereotaxic frame.
The mouse was then rapidly positioned on the nosecone to have constant supply of isoflurane and oxygen.
The ear bars were fixed to immobilize the head.
An analgesic was subcutaneously injected prior to surgery to minimize any possible pain after the recovery from anesthesia.
During the entire surgery, the animal was placed on a prewarmed heat pad to prevent hypothermia.
To prevent dehydration of cornea and further blinding of mouse, eyes were covered with a protective ointment.
All tools used during the surgery were sterilized using ethanol and/ or Microzide (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany).
Using bregma as a reference point, the coordinates for the injections into the DG were identified on both sides of the brain, and holes were carefully drilled in the skull.
The capillary was then slowly inserted until 1,900 μm of depth from skull level and 1 μl of BDNF (100μg/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was injected at 200 nl/min.
After injection, the capillary was kept inside for 5 minutes to prevent backsplash and then slowly retracted.
The same procedure was performed on the other hemisphere to inject 1 μl of PBS.
The ear bars were then released, the skin was wetted with PBS to regain the elasticity and stitched.
The wound was then treated with a disinfecting solution (Povidone, Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany).
Mouse was placed in an individual cage under a red light with water and presoaked food (to make it easier for animal to bite after the surgery).
Another injection of analgesic was performed 24 hours postsurgery.
Mice were sacrificed at 48 hours after injection and subjected for brain collection and further processing.

Mouse tissue preparations and stainings
For brain collection, the adult mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Ketamine (Bio-Techne GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) and Xylazine (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) (0.25 mL per 25 g of body weight) and then intracardiacally perfused with 0.9% NaCl (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) followed by cold freshly prepared 4% PFA (in phosphate buffer [pH 7.4]).
After, perfusion brains were harvested and fixed with 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4˚C and then washed 3 times with PBS.
For cryopreservation of tissue, fixed brains were further incubated overnight in 30% Sucrose (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) solution in PBS at 4˚C.
Free-floating sections of 40 μm thickness were prepared using microtome (Leica SM2010R, Nussloch, Germany) and were collected in 6 consecutive series in a cryopreservation solution in a 24-well plate.
Sections were then stored at -20˚C for further experiments.
Prior to IHC, the free-floating sections were washed in PBS 3 times, blocked in 10% Donkey or Goat Serum (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 hour at room temperature, and incubated overnight at 4˚C with the desired primary antibody of defined dilution in 3% Donkey or Goat Serum (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) with 0.2% Triton X-100.
Sections were washed 3 times within 1 hour and incubated for another 4 hours at room temperature with the correct secondary antibody coupled to a desired fluorophore.
After a short wash, samples were then incubated in DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) diluted in PBS (1:5,000) for 10 minutes.
Another 3 washing steps were done, and samples were then mounted on the charged glass slides (SuperFrostTM, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
After mounting, slides were left to dry and covered with a coverslip using Aqua Mount.

To identify DEGs in specific cell types, we added new "idents" to the R-object as the following: Treatment (PBS, AB42, IL4, 5HT, or AB42/IL4 cells together)_Main Cell Types, (Im, PC, NN, OPC/OD1 or OPC/OD_2)_receptor name.
The DEGs in each of these cells were identified after each treatment using FindMarkers function in Seurat.
p < 0.05 and |avg_logFC| � 0.25 were used for significantly expressed genes; p < 0.05 was used for overrepresented GO terms and KEGG pathways as described
Selection from DEGs for htr1d-positive cells were performed with the absolute log-fold change criterion of >0.25.

Electrophysiology
Adult zebrafish were cold-anesthetized in a slush of a frozen extracellular solution.
The skull was removed to allow access to the brain.
The brain was dissected out carefully and transferred to a recording chamber that was continuously perfused with an extracellular solution containing 135.2 mM NaCl (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 2.9 mM KCl (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 2.1 mM CaCl 2 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 10 mM HEPES (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.8; 290 mOsm, (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
For whole-cell intracellular recordings of her4.1:GFP cells in voltage-clamp mode, electrodes (resistance, 3-5 MO) were pulled from borosilicate glass (outer diameter, 1.5 mm; inner diameter, 0.87 mm; Hilgenberg GmbH, Malsfeld, Germany) on a micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with an intracellular solution containing 120 mM K-gluconate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 5 mM KCl (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 10 mM HEPES (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 4 mM Mg 2 ATP (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 0.3 mM Na 4 GTP, and 10 mM Na-phosphocreatine (pH 7.4; 275 mOsm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
GFP-positive cells were visualized using a microscope (LNscope; Luigs & Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Lumenera) and were then targeted specifically.
Intracellular patch-clamp electrodes were advanced to cells using a motorized micromanipulator (Luigs & Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) while applying constant positive pressure.
Intracellular signals were amplified with a MultiClamp 700B intracellular amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA).
All cells were clamped at -70 mV throughout all recordings.
All experiments were performed at room temperature (23˚C ± 1˚C).
Serotonin (100 μM; Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the physiological solution in all recordings, the recorded events were detected and analyzed using AxoGraph (version X 1.5.
Cells are color-coded in samples (A), cell clusters predicted by RandomForest (B), and cell clusters identified by Seurat (C) after using all 4 experimental groups together.
To use the same neuronal and progenitor clusters we identified before (
By using Seurat (C), cell clusters can also be inferred de novo.
The cell clusters and their top marker genes are identical, whereas some cell clusters (e.g., neurons) can be further subdivided depending on the algorithm used.
The color codes used in the middle panel are the same colors used in
The colors of PCs are also used in Seurat analyses (A).
A few cells from Aβ42 and 5-HT groups do not exist in other groups (control and IL4).
These cells express olfactory bulb markers and are contaminations of cells in sample preparation.
They cluster separately from all groups we analyzed and are not affecting the biological outcomes of the analyses.
Related to


or 5-HT (Fig 2E) showed that 5-HT reduces the neurogenic outcome by 12% (Fig 2F).
To verify our results, we used a transgenic reporter line that marks NSCs with GFP driven under the her4.1 promoter and injected Aβ42, IL4, or 5-HT followed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for GFP and PCNA at 1 dpi (Fig 2G).
Consistent with our previous results, Aβ42 and IL4 injection increased NSC proliferation by 35% and 42%, respectively, whereas 5-HT reduced the number of proliferating progenitors by 18% (Fig 2H), indicating that 5-HT has a negative impact on NSC plasticity in zebrafish telencephalon.
To further test whether the negative effects of 5-HT would be reversed by Aβ42 or IL4, we co-injected 5-HT with Aβ42 and IL4 and observed that the reduction in NSC proliferation by 5-HT can be abrogated by Aβ42 or IL4 (S3 Fig), indicating that 5-HT signaling acts antagonistically to IL4 in NSCs.


1:GFP, Fig 2I and 2J) and 5-HT innervation (Fig 2I and 2K).
We observed that NSCs are located apically and are separated by periventricular zone (PVZ) neurons before the proximal front of the serotonergic innervation in the parenchyma (Fig 2I), suggesting that the effect of 5-HT on NSCs could be indirect.
If this hypothesis was true, NSCs would not express 5-HT receptors.
To determine which cells expressed 5-HT receptors, we performed in situ hybridization (ISH) for 5-HT receptors (htr genes) and observed that among 7 serotonin receptor genes and in total 21 isoforms of those genes (S2 Data), only htr1a and htr1d gave ISH signals in adult zebrafish telencephalon (Fig 2L-2M´).
We observed that serotonin receptor genes are not expressed in the progenitor cells (S3 Fig), supporting previous findings [35] and suggesting that serotonin does not act directly on NSCs.
To further investigate this hypothesis, we performed electrophysiological recordings from 9 her4.1:GFP-positive
NSCs and 7 adjacent her4.1:GFP-negative cells (neurons; S3 Fig).
We found that out of 9 recorded NSCs (3 of them in the presence of tetrodotoxin [TTX]), none responded to serotonin (S3 Fig).
For the neurons, we recorded 8 (2 in the presence of TTX), and 7 of them responded to

(S4A Fig; S3 Data).
After quality control analyses (S4B Fig), we obtained t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) clusters, which dissolve into 4 major cell types: neurons (eno2, gap43, map1aa, sypbpositive), glia (gfap, her4.1, msi1, s100b-positive), oligodendrocytes (aplnrb, olig2-positive), and immune cells (pfn, lcp1-positive; S4C-S4E Fig).
Heat maps reveal marker genes expressed predominantly in those cells (S4D Fig).
To determine the cells that are responsive to 5-HT, we plotted the cells expressing htr1 and observed that htr1 expression was confined to neurons (S4F Fig).
This expression pattern was consistent with ISH results of htr1 genes (Fig 2M, S3G Fig) and was not overlapping with il4r.1-expressing cells that were exclusively glia and immune cells ([30] and S4F Fig).


Fig 3A; S4G Fig).
We found that 3,166 genes changed their expression levels in htr1d+ cells after 5-HT treatment (Fig 3B, S4 Data).
We hypothesized that a possible regulation between htr1d+ neurons and NSCs could be through a paracrine ligand-receptor crosstalk.
We found that in htr1d+ cells, 40 ligands change their expression levels (Fig 3C), 3 of which also change their expression reciprocally after 5-HT and IL4/ Aβ42 treatment (Fig 3D, and data from [34]).
The highest upregulation was observed for bdnf (Fig 3D).
From single-cell analyses, we found that bdnf was predominantly expressed in neuronal clusters (90% in neurons and 8% in glial cells; Fig 3E, S4H Fig), whereas its receptor ntrk2 [37,38] was expressed mainly in neurons (68% neuronal and 28% glia; Fig 3E, S4H Fig), and another BDNF receptor ngfra [37-39] was mostly glial (93% in glia and 5% in neurons; Fig 3E; S4H Fig).
Therefore, we hypothesized that 5-HT dependent regulation of bdnf expression might signal to the glial cells through ntrk2 and ngfra in the adult zebrafish brain.


Fig 3G and 3H; S5 Fig).
For mapping, we used the following 3 criteria: (1) we took either the bdnf as a starting point (i.e., the cells expressing bdnf are matched with the cells expressing any bdnf receptor, or the bdnf receptors ntrk2 and ngfra were taken as starting points [i.e., only ntrk2 or ngfraexpressing cells were matched with cells expressing any ligand for those receptors (Fig 3H for ngfra and S6A Fig for ntrk2)]); (2) charted the potential interactions as arrows starting from bdnf-expressing clusters to bdnf receptor-expressing clusters (Fig 3G) or to bdnf receptorexpressing clusters from clusters expressing their ligands (Fig 3H), and (3) depending on the change of the interaction after any treatment, we color-coded the interactions (black arrows indicate interactions that are unchanged by the treatment, cyan arrows indicate the


, S4 Fig), whereas the ntrk2 interaction map provided only a small number of interactions to another glial cluster (S4 Fig, S6A Fig).We observed that IL4 activates many interaction routes to NSC clusters whereas 5-HT almost diminishes all the interactions between NSCs and other cells (Fig3H).
These in silico analyses suggest that IL4 promotes the interactions between neurons and NSCs whereas 5-HT suppresses such interactions.

On the contrary, ngfra is expressed mainly in the ventricular zone where NSCs reside (Fig 4I, S6 Fig).

Next, we performed co-staining of Ki67 with microglial marker Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1) and found that almost all Ki67-positive cells are Iba1-positive, suggesting that BDNF induces microglial proliferation resulting in microgliosis but not NSC proliferation (S7 Fig, S10 Fig).
