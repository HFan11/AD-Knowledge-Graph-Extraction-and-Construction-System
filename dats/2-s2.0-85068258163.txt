Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9, Brain Cholesterol Homeostasis and Potential Implication for Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with dysregulation of brain cholesterol homeostasis.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), beyond the known role in the regulation of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was first identified in the brain with a potential involvement in brain development and apoptosis.
However, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) and in AD pathogenesis is still far from being understood.
While in vitro and in vivo evidence led to controversial results, genetic studies apparently did not find an association between PCSK9 loss of function mutations and AD risk or prevalence.
In addition, a potential impairment of cognitive performances by the treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, have been excluded, although ongoing studies with longer follow-up will provide further insights.
PCSK9 is able to affect the expression of neuronal receptors involved in cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation, and higher PCSK9 concentrations have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients.
In this review article, we critically examined the science of PCSK9 with respect to its modulatory role of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD.
In addition, based on literature data, we made the hypothesis to consider brain PCSK9 as a negative modulator of brain cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation and a potential pharmacological target for treatment.

INTRODUCTION
The Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), acts as one of the major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, by mediating the degradation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr)
Interestingly, PCSK9 was firstly identified in the brain where its expression in primary embryonic telencephalon cells was maximal between embryonic days 13-15, a gestational period characterized by intense neurogenesis
In zebrafish, but not in mice, specific knockdown of PCSK9 mRNA led to a general disorganization of cerebellar neurons and loss of hindbrain-midbrain boundaries, with an end result of embryonic death
In this review article, we will focus on the role of PCSK9 at the cerebral level with particular attention on its potential involvement in neuronal functions and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.
We also critically examined the possibility to consider PCSK9 as a modulator of brain cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation and a potential pharmacological target for neurodegenerative disorders.

BRAIN CHOLESTEROL HOMEOSTASIS
Cholesterol is one of the most important molecules in brain physiology
Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain relies on in situ local cholesterol synthesis
In fact, cholesterol cannot cross the BBB, unlike its side-chain oxidized metabolites, 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol
Central nervous system (CNS) cells are able to synthesize cholesterol but adult neurons progressively loose this capacity and become dependent on cholesterol provided from astrocytes
Depletion of neuronal cholesterol leads to excess tau phosphorylation, changes in β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides metabolism, neural oxidative stress reactions, ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration, as demonstrated in ex vivo rat hippocampus slices
The transport of cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons is warranted by peculiar molecules and receptors that cooperate in a coordinated manner.
Cholesterol produced from astrocytes undergoes cholesterol efflux to Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)containing particles through the activity of transporters, such as the ATP binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1), G1 (ABCG1) and G4 (ABCG4)
Subsequently, cholesterol transported by such particles, that resemble plasma HDL in composition and size, is finally incorporated into neurons by the particles binding to specific receptors, such as the LDL receptor (LDLr), the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), the VLDL receptor (VLDLr) and the ApoE receptor 2 (ApoEr2)
Concerning the latter two, PCSK9 increases their degradation
This hypothesis is strengthened by in vivo findings showing that LDLr expression is reduced by PCSK9 during brain development and after transient ischemic stroke
It is therefore conceivable that the degrading activity of PCSK9 on lipoprotein receptors listed above may translate in a reduced cholesterol uptake by neurons, with potential deleterious consequences
However, not all data are consistent with this hypothesis.
These discrepancies highlight the need for further studies to dissect out the involvement of PCSK9 on brain cholesterol homeostasis.

PCSK9 AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOGENESIS
Alterations of CNS cholesterol homeostasis are associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, including AD
Genomic-wide association (GWAS) studies have identified several loci involved in lipid metabolism among AD susceptible genes
A striking example of this association is the ε4 allele of the APOE gene encoding ApoE, the main apolipoprotein mediating the transport of cholesterol in the CNS
The E4 isoform is undoubtedly one of the most predictive factors for AD onset
However, recent studies have identified other genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as BIN1, CLU, PICALM, ABCA7, ABCA1, ABCG1 and SORL1
From a molecular point of view, the cerebral cholesterol accumulates in lipid rafts, membrane microdomains where the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP;
At this regards, it has been found that cholesterol promotes amyloidogenesis by providing structural stability to membrane-adjacent lipid rafts
Consequently, modulation of cholesterol content in lipid rafts is able to affect deposition of Aβ.
The few and controversial data on PCSK9 and AD are summarized in Table
Concerning neuronal apoptosis, a pro-apoptotic activity of PCSK9 may occur through the upregulation of caspases or the reduction of the ApoEr2 levels
In APOE (-/-) mice fed with a high-fat diet, the hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was associated with an increase of PCSK9 expression
Consistently, silencing of PCSK9 attenuates the neuronal apoptosis induced by cerebral ischemia reducing brain damage in mice
Conversely, a preventive action of PCSK9 on neuronal apoptosis may occur through the decrease in Aβ generation
In addition, the direct effect of PCSK9 on Aβ processing is still unresolved.
In its absence, mice show increased expression of the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the protease producing toxic Aβ that accumulates in neuritic plaques of AD brains.
This effect translates in an increased total Aβ brain deposition: PCSK9 overexpression in mice reduced BACE1 levels
On the other hand, in brain-damaged rats, the administration of a small molecule inhibiting PCSK9 prevented dendritic spine loss by attenuating the aggregation of Aβ and neuroinflammation
No evidence that PCSK9 regulates BACE1 levels or APP processing in the brain of mice has been reported by other authors
To the best of our knowledge, no data are available on the potential influence of PCSK9 on tau phosphorylation, another peculiar hallmark of AD pathogenesis.
The impact of PCSK9 on neurocognitive performances in pre-clinical models has been indirectly suggested by the observation that deletion of the LRP1, which is sensitive to the degrading action of PCSK9
Consistently, mice lacking the LDLr show signs of impaired learning and memory
Lipoprotein Receptors Target of PCSK9 and Their Role in Alzheimer's Disease
Besides APOE, several cholesterol homeostasis related genes have been investigated for their association with AD
LRP1 is an ApoE receptor, and both positive and negative results on its genetic association with AD have been reported
LRP1 expression is reduced in total brain and brain capillaries with increasing age and even more reduced in AD
Highly validated genetic risk factors for AD, like the APOE allele, may be linked to a reduced clearance of Aβ via LRP1
LRP1 mediates Aβ clearance from the brain into the circulation at the BBB
Thus, LRP1 plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of the ApoE-Aβ complex and ApoE may compete with Aβ for the interaction with LRP1, resulting in impaired Aβ clearance
LRP1 is also involved in the hepatic clearance of Aβ
Because LRP1 is expressed in different cell types, including neurons, astrocytes and vascular cells in the brain, its levels may be altered differently in AD
Indeed, LRP1 levels are decreased in neurons but increased in vascular cells or astrocytes that are proximate to amyloid plaques in AD brains
PCSK9 may induce the degradation of LRP1 in different cell types, including hepatocytes
Since PCSK9 is expressed in neurons and in vascular cells, it may influence the LRP1 levels in these cell types
Thus, the observed increased PCSK9 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations in AD
The LDLr is a major ApoE receptor in the brain and genetic studies aiming at identifying its link to AD are controversial, although one large study found an association in men but not in women
In a mouse model of AD, LDLr demonstrated a beneficial effect via enhancement of Aβ clearance
VLDLr can be involved in the clearance of ApoE-Aβ complexes
However, a meta-analysis of genetic studies conducted on the VLDLr gene polymorphic triplet (CGG) repeat in the 5-UTR showed contradictory results, being a protective factor for AD in Caucasians and as a risk factor in Asian people
In addition, genetic association with AD was described in one study but not confirmed in two replication studies
Thus, the direct association of VLDLr and AD still needs to be proven.
The scavenger receptor CD36 is involved in fibrillar Aβ-mediated microglial activation and consecutive activation of an innate immune response
PCSK9 leads to increased CD36 expression in macrophages and microglial-like cells
Indeed, CD36 acts as a co-receptor for the toll-like receptors (TLRs) heterodimerization, an essential step for the initiation of the inflammatory signals and microglia-dependent neurodegeneration
Consistently, PCSK9 elicits a proinflammatory effect on macrophages
Finally, our group reported that human recombinant PCSK9 inhibits the ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages
In this regard, data on the influence of ABCA1 in AD are conflicting as well.
For example, carriers of the R219K SNP in the ABCA1 gene shown 33% lower total cholesterol in CSF compared to non-carriers.
This allele is also associated with a delay of disease onset by 1.7 years on average
This suggests that a genetic variability of ABCA1 influences the development of AD, possibly by interfering with CNS cholesterol homeostasis.
Nevertheless, an association of the same ABCA1 variant R219K with increased AD risk has been described
Similarly, additional evidence reported the association between genetic variants of ABCA1 gene with either reduced or increased AD risk
Specifically, a genetic study involving more than 90,000 subjects evidenced a significant association between ABCA1 loss-of-function mutation and 41% increased risk of AD
Nevertheless, also for ABCA1, several negative studies have been published, such as a meta-analysis where no association has been found between R219K, I883M and R1587K polymorphisms and risk of AD
The involvement of ABCA1 in AD has been investigated in ABCA1 knock-out mice cross-bred with an amyloid pathology of AD.
The absence of ABCA1 determined a higher amyloid load in the brains
Since ABCA1 regulates ApoE levels and the transfer of cholesterol from the glial to the neuronal compartment
Consistent with this hypothesis, a strong decrease in ApoE levels in both the cortex and CSF, together with an impairment of its lipidation, has been described in ABCA1 knock-out mice
Interestingly, CSF samples extracted from AD patients have lower ex-vivo capacity to promote ABCA1-
(3) A portion of Aβ may be transported through LRP1 at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reversed into the blood, thus PCSK9 may also interfere with this process.
(4) Both LRP1 and CD36 expressed in the liver might also help the clearance of Aβ from the blood, and PCSK9 may affect this pathway by reducing their expression levels in hepatocytes.
(
PCSK9 has been shown to downregulate the expression of ABCA1, thus opening to a possible modulation of the release of ApoE containing lipoproteins and thus LRP1-or CD36-mediated Aβ metabolism.
Indeed, ApoE isoforms may affect LRP1-mediated Aβ metabolism by directly interacting with Aβ or competing with Aβ for receptor binding.
(6) ApoE lipoprotein may also interact with PCSK9 hence influencing its action on LRP1 and CD36.
mediated cholesterol efflux compared to controls
Finally, a further level of complexity could be the possible binding between PCSK9 and apoE-containing lipoproteins as previously described for LDL

PCSK9 and Alzheimer's Disease in Humans
The genetic studies conducted so far in humans (Table
Although
Consistently, in a recent Mendelian randomization analysis, PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations were not associated to a rise in the risk of AD [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.50; p = 0.37;
To a negative conclusion came also the results of genetic studies among African American REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) participants with and without the PCSK9 loss-of-function variants C697X or Y142X.
The presence of these variants did not affect the primary endpoint of the study, i.e., the neurocognitive performance
In another study conducted in French Canadian subjects, carriers of the PCSK9 loss of function mutations, R46L and InsLEU, did not differ from non-carriers as either AD prevalence or age of disease onset
In humans, PCSK9 has been detected in CSF even though at a much lower concentration compared to plasma
CSF PCSK9 concentrations appeared to be constant throughout the day, thus not undergoing the typical diurnal pattern of plasma PCSK9
In a previous work, we demonstrated increased levels of PCSK9 in the CSF of AD patients with the highest levels in APOE ε4 carriers
These data suggest an involvement of PCSK9 in the disease and a pathophysiological link with APOE4 that deserves further investigations.
Our observation has been confirmed by

PCSK9 Inhibitors and Neurocognitive Disorders
Plasma cholesterol under the PCSK9 inhibitor (alirocumab, evolocumab or bococizumab) treatment reached very low levels (mean level 30 mg/dL in the FOURIER trial and 25 mg/dL in ODYSSEY LONG-TERM and SPIRE trials)
These observations raised some concerns about the potential side effects related to the clinical use of PCSK9 inhibitors.
In particular, some clinical trials highlighted a potential association between treatment with PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and cognitive adverse events
However, such disorders were often self-reported and occurred in very few patients with pre-existing medical conditions or other confounders, as emerged from the results of an analysis made by the FDA
In order to better clarify this issue, a recent study prospectively and objectively evaluated the effect of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab on cognitive functions
In this study, a total of 1,204 subjects with mean age of 65 years, that did not present neurological disorders on treatment with evolocumab or placebo, were followed for 1.6 years without evidencing any association with adverse cognitive effects
This result was further confirmed by a recent meta-analysis
However, considering the short follow-up period of the EBBINGHAUS, a 5-year extension of the FOURIER trial will provide further findings on neurocognitive functions 1 .
The lack of an evident effect by PCSK9 inhibitors on cognitive functions is very likely explained by the BBB presence, with the consequence that high or low levels of cholesterol in the circulation are not likely to have direct effects on lipid level in the brain
With this respect, in the genetic study with carriers of PCSK9 loss-of-function variants, lifelong exposure to low levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was not indeed associated with neurocognitive effects
Moreover, BBB limits the access of both PCSK9
Under the conditions where the integrity of BBB is intact, the presence of tight junctions prevents the transcellular route for diffusion of antibodies across the capillary.
Therefore, in general, the antibodies penetration into the brain has been estimated to be about 0.1%, both in humans and animals
In some pathological conditions, such as diabetes, the BBB might be compromised
However, some indications ruling out the possibility that the antibodies cross the BBB in such conditions, come from the EBBINGHAUS study, which also involves diabetic subjects (37.2%), and 1
Thus, it would be of great interest to evaluate the effect of small molecules PCSK9 inhibitors capable of crossing the BBB.

CONCLUSION
Although several extrahepatic effects of PCSK9 beyond LDL-C
In this regard, pathophysiological studies on pre-clinical models of AD led to controversial results, leaving open the question of the potential implication of PCSK9 in the disease pathogenesis.
Furthermore, the few genetic studies available focused only on PCSK9 genetic variants leading to loss-of-function mutations and are not supportive of an association between PCSK9 and AD risk
Notably, in all of the studies, only plasma PCSK9 concentrations have been evaluated, while PCSK9 cannot cross the BBB and its regulation may be different in the central and periphery body compartments.
Based on the observation made by ourselves and others regarding increased PCSK9 levels in the CSF of AD patients and considering that PCSK9 may interfere with CNS cholesterol transport by degrading the neuronal ApoE-receptors responsible for astrocyte-derived cholesterol uptake, it is conceivable to hypothesize a PCSK9-induced impairment of cholesterol supply to neurons occurring in AD.
The consequences of this cholesterol-depletion would include a loss of neuronal physiological functions and ultimately neurodegeneration.
In addition, PCSK9 may contribute to exacerbate neuroinflammation, possibly acting on the receptors CD36 and TLR4
These hypotheses, that are being tested by our research group, may set the basis for testing new pharmacological approaches, including existing small molecules potentially able to cross the BBB by either diffusion or transporter-mediated processes, differing from the anti-PCSK9 antibodies.
These molecules, by restoring the physiological brain cholesterol transport from astrocytes to neurons in CNS and by attenuating the neuroinflammation through CD36-TRL4 pathway inhibition, might clear the path for a potential future innovative AD therapy.

LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), expressed in microglia, neurons, astrocytes and pericytes, and CD36, mainly present in microglia, are the two main lipoprotein receptors involved in Aβ clearance and are potentially targeted by PCSK9.
(1) LRP1 may also influence the production of Aβ from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons through a direct protein-protein interaction or competition with the α/β-secretase cleavage of APP.
