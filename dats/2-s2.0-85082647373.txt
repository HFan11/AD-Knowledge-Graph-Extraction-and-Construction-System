Acute Pannexin 1 Blockade Mitigates Early Synaptic Plasticity Defects in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease
Synaptic loss induced by soluble oligomeric forms of the amyloid β peptide (sAβos) is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is thought to be the major cause of the cognitive deficits.
These abnormalities rely on defects in synaptic plasticity, a series of events manifested as activity-dependent modifications in synaptic structure and function.
It has been reported that pannexin 1 (Panx1), a nonselective channel implicated in cell communication and intracellular signaling, modulates the induction of excitatory synaptic plasticity under physiological contexts and contributes to neuronal death under inflammatory conditions.
Here, we decided to study the involvement of Panx1 in functional and structural defects observed in excitatory synapses of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic (Tg) mice, an animal model of AD.
We found an age-dependent increase in the Panx1 expression that correlates with increased Aβ levels in hippocampal tissue from Tg mice.
Congruently, we also observed an exacerbated Panx1 activity upon basal conditions and in response to glutamate receptor activation.
The acute inhibition of Panx1 activity with the drug probenecid (PBN) did not change neurodegenerative parameters such as amyloid deposition or astrogliosis, but it significantly reduced excitatory synaptic defects in the AD model by normalizing long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression and improving dendritic arborization and spine density in hippocampal neurons of the Tg mice.
These results suggest a major contribution of Panx1 in the early mechanisms leading to the synaptopathy in AD.
Indeed, PBN induced a reduction in the activation of p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), a kinase widely implicated in the early neurotoxic signaling in AD.
Our data strongly suggest that an enhanced expression and activation of Panx1 channels contribute to the Aβ-induced cascades leading to synaptic dysfunction in AD.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe deterioration of cognitive functions leading to dementia
Classical neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles or extracellular deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques, have been considered as the culprit of neuronal damage; however, they show a weak correlation with memory loss
Evidence from human brain studies suggests that the best correlate with cognitive deficits are synaptic loss and hippocampal volume reduction
Accordingly, synaptic dysfunction and memory impairments have been reported in several animal models of AD before the appearance of neuropathological changes
In this regard, a number of evidences suggest that soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ (sAβos), identified in AD patients
Congruently, sAβos from different sources (i.e., synthetic, cell line-derived, human and mouse brain-derived) induce detrimental effects on memory
Mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity manifest as activity-induced long-lasting changes in the synaptic efficacy, which have been better characterized in the CA1 region of the hippocampus
There, the most prominent forms of excitatory synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of the synaptic strength, which require the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) for its induction
Both LTP and LTD are expressed by changes in the trafficking, surface expression, and functionality of glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs;
These modifications in synaptic functionality are accompanied by structural rearrangements in the synaptic connections
sAβos have been shown to affect both structural
sAβos-induced LTP inhibition seems to involve excessive activation of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs
Although sAβos-induced signaling cascades are relatively well studied, the molecular mechanisms modulating these processes are still poorly understood.
Recently, we reported that Panx1, a protein that forms functional nonselective channels in the plasma membrane and that is implicated in cell communication
This Panx1 function appears to be induced by NMDAR and mGluR5, as glutamate receptors overactivation stimulates ATP release and promote hippocampal hyperactivity, which can be prevented by Panx1 blockers
Remarkably, the application of exogenous Aβ in acute hippocampal slices has been shown to induce neuronal death via increasing surface membrane expression and activity of Panx1 channels
With this in mind, we investigated the participation of Panx1 channels in the synaptic impairments observed in hippocampal tissue of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic (Tg) mice, a transgenic animal model of AD
Specifically, we evaluated Panx1 expression and activity in hippocampal tissue of Tg mice and the impact of inhibiting its activity on neurodegeneration parameters, such as Aβ deposition and astrogliosis, and on synaptic plasticity and neuronal structure.
Our data show that Panx1 is overexpressed and overactive in Tg hippocampal tissue and that its expression correlates well with enhanced levels of the Aβ peptide.
The acute inhibition of Panx1 with probenecid (PBN) reverts the defects in synaptic plasticity and structure observed in hippocampal tissue of Tg mice but has no significant effects on neurodegeneration, suggesting that Panx1 activation plays a major role in the initial steps of the synaptopathy in AD.
In fact, PBN significantly reduces the activation of p38MAPK, a kinase that reportedly enhances its expression and activity at early stages of AD

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were carried out in 6-month-old (m.o.) C57BL/6 wild-type (Wt) or APPswe/PSEN1∆E9 mice (Tg mice).
Tg mice, which express the mutant APPSWE (K595N/M596L) and PSEN1∆E9, deletion of the exon 9 (APP/PS1 mice stock 004462), were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
Mice were housed at 22 • C at constant humidity (55%), 12/12-h dark-light cycle, with a light phase from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.
Food and water were provided ad libitum.
The use and care of the animals were approved by the Ethics and Animal Care Committee of Universidad de Valparaíso (BEA064-2015).

Drugs and Treatments

PBN
and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-Sphenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
SB203580 (SB) was kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Quest (Universidad de Chile).
All other chemicals were purchased from Merck or Sigma.
Drugs were applied in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) as follows: After brain dissection, hemispheres (histology) or slices (electrophysiology and biochemistry) were maintained in ACSF bubbled with a mixture of 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 plus vehicle [sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] or drug (100 µM PBN, 1 µM SB, and 0.5 µM DAPT) for 2 h.

Excitatory Postsynaptic Field Recordings
Hippocampal slices were prepared as we previously reported
Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, brains quickly removed and hippocampus sectioned in slices of 350 µm in ice-cold dissection buffer using a vibroslicer (Leica VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany).
After 1 h stabilization in ACSF (in mM: 119 NaCl, 26 NaHCO 3 , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 4 CaCl 2 , 4 MgCl 2 , 1.25 NaHPO 4 ), slices were treated with 100 µM PBN in ACSF for 2 h and then subjected to stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals using 0.2-ms pulses delivered through concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes and recorded extracellularly in the stratum radiatum of CA1.
LTP was induced using four theta burst stimulations (TBSs; 10 trains of four pulses at 100 Hz; 5 Hz inter-burst interval) delivered at 0.1 Hz.
LTD was induced using paired-pulse (50-ms interval) low-frequency stimulation (ppLFS; 900 pulses delivered at 1 Hz) in the presence or absence of PBN.
LTP and LTD magnitudes were calculated as the average (normalized to baseline) of the responses recorded 50-60 min after conditioning stimulation.

Synaptosomal Fractionation
Synaptosomes were extracted from hippocampus of 6 m.o.
male mice as we previously described
Hippocampi were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer [320 mM sucrose, 4 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N ,N -tetraacetic acid; EGTA), pH 7.4; protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails] using a Dounce tissue grinder.
The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000× g for 10 min at 4 • C (Beckman F0630 rotor) obtaining a supernatant (S1), which was collected, whereas the pellet (P1) was discarded.
Then, S1 was centrifuged at 12,000× g for 20 min at 4 • C. The obtained pellet (P2) containing the membrane proteins was resuspended in homogenization buffer, layered on the top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (0.32/1.0/1.2
M) and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 165,000× g (Beckman SW-60ti rotor) for 65 min at 4 • C.
Then, both the sediment and sucrose 0.32/1 M interface were discarded, whereas material accumulated at the interface of 1.0 M and 1.2 M sucrosecontaining synaptosome (SP1) fraction was collected.
SP1 was diluted with lysis buffer to restore the sucrose concentration to 320 mM and remained on ice with gentle agitation for 30 min.
Then, SP1 was centrifuged at 33,000× g (Beckman F0630 rotor) for 30 min.
The pellet obtained (PS1) was resuspended in a gradient load buffer, loaded on 0.32/1.0/1.2
M discontinuous gradient, and centrifuged at 165,000× g (Beckman SW-60ti rotor) for 65 min.
The sucrose 1/1.2 M interphase, synaptosome fraction 2 (SP2), was recovered and delipidated in a delipidating buffer.
Next, SP2 was diluted with a filling buffer to restore the sucrose concentration and then centrifuged at 33,000× g (Beckman F0630 rotor) for 1 h.
The sediment obtained (PS2) was washed with 50 mM HEPES-Na and centrifuged at 165,000× g (Beckman SW-60ti rotor) for 10 min.
The final sediment obtained (PS3), containing postsynaptic densities (PSDs), was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES-Na and homogenized.
PS2 or PSD fractions were quantified for protein concentration and submitted to Western blot.

Western Blot
Hippocampal slices (5-6 slices per animal; seven animals per group) from 3-to 12-months mice were frozen with dry ice and homogenized in lysis buffer [150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 2 mM, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)], supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) by using a glass-Potter homogenizer.
Protein samples from whole homogenates or synaptosomal fractions were centrifuged twice for 10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 • C. Protein concentration was determined with the Qubit Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
For both cases, 40 µg of protein per lane were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by immunoblotting on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (BioRad, Berkeley, CA, USA) and probed with specific antibodies against Panx1 (rabbit anti-Panx1, ABN242 Merck; 1:1,000), PSD-95 (mouse anti-PSD-95, MAB1596 Merck, 1:1,000), synaptophysin (goat anti-SYP, sc-9116, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:2,000), p38 MAPK (rabbit anti-p38MAPK, #9212, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 1:1,000), phospho-p38 MAPK (rabbit anti-Thr180/Tyr182, #9211, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 1:1,000), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; mouse anti-GAPDH, sc-47724, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:1,000).
Band intensities were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, BioRad, Berkeley, CA, USA), and the intensity of each band was scanned and densitometrically quantified using the ImageJ software (version 1.49v; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
sAβos were measured by a slot blot assays as previously described
Briefly, the total protein extract was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 1 h to eliminate fibrillar aggregates.
The protein concentration of the soluble fraction was determined, and 6 mg of protein was spotted in 0.45-mm 2 nitrocellulose (Millipore, Kankakee, IL, USA), blocked with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBS-T) gelatin 0.4% and incubated using antibodies against total Aβ (6E10, BioLegend; 1:1,000) against oligomeric forms of Aβ (A11; rabbit anti-oligomer, AHB0052, Sigma, 1:5,000) and against Panx1 (rabbit anti-Panx1, ABN242, Merck; 1:1,000).
Slot blots were then processed as mentioned above.

Histology
For histological studies, mice were transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer pH 7.4.
For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded brain tissue was cut into 7-µm sections using a cryostat (Leica CM1900) and treated for endogenous peroxidase blockade (3% hydrogen peroxide) followed by CAS-Block (Invitrogen, 008120) and blocking solution (5% goat serum, 0.3% Tween 20 in PBS).
Tissues were incubated with primary rabbit anti-Panx1 antibody (ABN242, Merck; 1:200), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; clone 2E1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:500), and mouse anti-amyloid peptide antibody (clone 6E10, BioLegend; 1:1,000), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; 1:250) and diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma D5637) or p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3'-indolyphosphate p-toluidine (BCIP) (Thermo 34042) to visualization of peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase reactions, respectively.
Additionally, brain sections were co-stained with Congo red (5%, Sigma) to mark amyloid material or counterstained with Nissl or Kluver-Barrera stains.
Images were acquired in an upright microscope (Leica DM500) attached to a Leica ICC50W camera.
For immunofluorescence, 20-µm sections were stained with primary rabbit anti-Panx1 antibody (ABN242, Merck; 1:100), rabbit anti-GFAP (Z0334, DAKO; 1:500), rabbit anti-NeuN (AB177487, Abcam; 1:500), mouse anti-Panx1 antibody (MAB7097, R&D Systems; 1:200), mouse anti-GFAP (clone 2E1, Santa Cruz; 1:250), and mouse anti-amyloid peptide antibody (clone 6E10, BioLegend; 1:500), followed by cyanineconjugated secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500).
Additionally, brain sections were co-stained with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma; 1:1,000) to label nuclei.
Images were acquired in a confocal microscope (upright Eclipse Nikon 80i) using an immersion-oil Plan Fluor 100× magnification objective (NA 1.3) and identical exposure settings between compared samples.
The astrocytic burden was measured by estimating the area of GFAP immunostaining regarding the total area (N = 5-6 fields from three to four animals per group).

Ethidium Bromide Uptake Assay
To test the activity of Panx1 channels under basal or glutamate receptor activation conditions, hippocampal slices were stabilized in a chamber with oxygenated ACSF (95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ) pH 7.4 for 1 h and then incubated with 20 µM of ethidium bromide (EtBr) for 5 min in ACSF only or in the presence of 50 µM of NMDA or 100 µM (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG).
To test the activity of Panx1 and the effect of p38MAPK or γ-secretase inhibitors, hippocampal slices were stabilized for 2 h in the presence of PBN, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB, or the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT and their respective vehicles and then incubated with 20 µM of EtBr for 5 min in ACSF.
After that, the slices were washed three times during 15 min with ACSF, fixed at room temperature with 4% PFA and 15% sucrose for 30 min, and maintained in PBS buffer.
Then, slices were cut into 25-µm sections using a cryostat (Leica CM1900).
The sections were stained with primary mouse anti βIII tubulin (clone 5G8, Promega; 1:1,000), rabbit anti-GFAP (Z0334, DAKO; 1:1,000), or mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377, Merck; 1:200), followed by cyanine-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500).
Mounted sections were examined in an Olympus IX81 Custom microscope coupled to an Olympus F-View Monochromatic CCD camera.
Images were acquired with a 20× objective using Xcellence Pro software and processed with a custom-made algorithm based on Fiji (ImageJ software).
Dye uptake ratio was calculated as the mean fluorescence intensity of the population of positive β-III tubulin or NeuN cells and normalized to the Wt group.
At least three fields were selected in every slice.

Golgi Staining to Dendritic Morphology Visualization
Dissected mouse brains were maintained for 2 h at room temperature in ACSF bubbled with a mixture of 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 in the presence or the absence of 100 µM PBN and then processed for Golgi impregnation following manufacturer's instructions (FD NeuroTechnologies, Columbia, MD, USA).
Coronal sections of 150-µm-thick brain slices were obtained using a semiautomatic cryostat microtome (Kedee KD-2950, Germany) at -20 • C and mounted on gelatincoated slides, developed with solutions of the same kit, dehydrated with a growing battery of alcohols (50-100%), and mounted using Entellan media (Millipore-Sigma, Germany).
Images of pyramidal hippocampal neurons were acquired by a Leica Application Suite X (LASX, Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) under bright-field microscopy at 40× or 100× magnification using similar light conditions between experimental groups.
Images were digitalized in 1,200 × 1,200 dpi resolution for morphometric analysis.

Morphometric Analysis
Well-impregnated CA1 pyramidal neurons which had their branching isolated from surrounding neurons and their soma located in the middle third of the tissue were used for analysis.
Camera lucida drawings were performed using a 40× objective (Leica M80 attached to Leica DM500).
Analysis of the camera lucida drawings were traced using the NeuronJ plugin and then quantified using Sholl analysis macro ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Dendritic branching was quantified as the number of intersections with concentric circles at increasing diameters (20-µm steps) placed around the cell body.
Dendritic length and spine number were analyzed at 20 µm in Sholl analysis.
All morphological analyses were performed blind to the experimental conditions.

Statistical Analysis
Data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Normality distribution of raw data was probed by Shapiro-Wilk test.
Unpaired, two-tailed Student's T-tests or Mann-Whitney rank test for two sample comparison, ANOVA followed by Tukey's or Bonferroni's post hoc test, or Kruskal-Wallis followed by a Dunn's correction for multiple comparisons were performed to determine significant differences.

RESULTS

Pannexin 1 Expression and Activity in Transgenic Mouse Hippocampal Tissue
Panx1 is expressed in several brain areas including neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum with an age-dependent pattern
To evaluate whether Panx1 expression and distribution were altered in Tg brains, we performed Western blots from whole hippocampal homogenates using tissue from 3-to 12-m.o.
Wt and Tg mice (Figure
First, we confirmed that Panx1 expression was reduced during aging in Wt animals.
Similarly, Tg also showed an age-dependent reduction, but reaching a peak of expression at 6 m.o. and decreasing after that.
However, the expression of Panx1 was greater in whole hippocampal lysates from Tg compared to Wt mice in all the age ranges (Figure
Moreover, a tendency to greater levels of Panx1 was observed in hippocampal synaptosomeenriched fractions isolated from 6-m.o.
Tg compared to the Wt brains (Supplementary Figure
Interestingly, the increased Panx1 expression observed in Tg hippocampal tissue significantly correlated with the age-dependent rising levels of Aβ in Tg samples estimated by slot blot experiments using the 6E10 antibody (Figure
Instead, an inverse and nonsignificant correlation between Panx1/Aβ expressions was found in Wt samples (Figure
Similar results were obtained when the anti-oligomer A11 antibody was used to detect Aβ (Supplementary Figure
Since Panx1 has been shown to be expressed not only in pyramidal neurons but also in interneurons and astrocytes
As shown in Figure
In fact, Panx1positive astrocytes were significantly more in Tg slices compared to Wt animals (Supplementary Figure
Interestingly, Panx1 exhibited a punctate staining pattern around amyloid plaques, in the pyramidal cell layer, neuropil, and reactive astrocytes (Supplementary Figure
These data strongly suggest that Panx1 is overexpressed in the hippocampal tissue of the Tg mice.
In order to evaluate whether this augmented Panx1 expression associated with an enhanced Panx1 activity, we performed dye uptake experiments in hippocampal slices from Wt and Tg mice using EtBr in the presence of La +3 to block the uptake through connexin hemichannels
As shown in Figure
Similarly, when we stimulated hippocampal slices with NMDA and DHPG to induce NMDARs and mGluR5 overactivation, we observed a higher EtBr fluorescence in hippocampal slices from Tg compared to Wt tissue (Figure
PBN significantly decreased EtBr fluorescence in both Wt and Tg slices, indicating that dye uptake was through Panx1 channels.
Together, these data suggest that, in the AD context, NMDAR and mGluR5 activation induces an exacerbated Panx1 activity.

Pannexin 1 Blockade With Probenecid Does Not Affect Neurodegeneration-Related Events in Transgenic Mice
Along with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, abnormal inflammation including reactive gliosis is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of AD
In fact, activated astrocytes and microglia surrounding amyloid plaques have been shown in AD brains
Accordingly, an increased GFAP staining has been previously reported in this AD model at 6 m.o.
Considering that Panx1 channels have been involved in inflammatory conditions
Hippocampal slices were treated during 2 h with 100 µM of PBN and then processed for the evaluation of neurodegeneration parameters.
As shown in Figure
Treatment with PBN did not have a significant effect on this Aβ accumulation (Figure
Congo red-positive amyloid plaques were present in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex of Tg  mice but were absent in Wt brains (Figure
PBN treatment did not significantly affect the number of amyloid plaques (Figures
As previously reported
However, treatment with PBN did not affect the percentage of reactive astrocytes (Figure
Similarly, PBN had no effect on the reduced number of neurons in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and adjacent cortex of Tg mice (Figures
Together, these data indicate that the acute blockade of Panx1 with PBN is not able to interfere with the toxic events associated with the neurodegenerative process in the AD context and suggest that Panx1 overactivation could have a more important role in earlier mechanisms.

Pannexin 1 Blockade With Probenecid Normalizes Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity in Transgenic Mice
LTP and LTD of the excitatory synaptic strength, the more prominent forms of synaptic plasticity, have been proposed to be the molecular basis of learning and memory
One of the earliest processes induced by the Aβ signaling in AD is an enhanced glutamate transmission
This latter has been suggested as an initial stage of the disease that correlates well with the early cognitive decline in AD
Therefore, we analyzed the impact of interfering with Panx1 overactivity on LTP/LTD in acute hippocampal slices of the Tg mice.
To do that, we induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from 6 m.o.
mice applying standard theta burst (TBS) and ppLFS protocols to induce LTP and LTD, respectively
Slices were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 µM PBN during 2 h before synaptic plasticity induction.
As shown in Figure
The treatment with PBN modified excitatory synaptic responses in Tg slices, reducing LTD and increasing LTP, reaching values comparable to those observed in Wt slices (Figures
At intermediate frequencies of stimulation (5 and 10 Hz), PBN produced similar effects, demonstrating that the Panx1 blockade changes the threshold for synaptic modifications in the AD model (Figure
These data support the hypothesis that Panx1 overactivation is involved in the synaptic dysfunction early induced by sAβos.

Pannexin 1 Blockade With Probenecid Improves Dendritic Morphology and Spine Density in the Hippocampus of Transgenic Mice
Activity-dependent modifications in the efficacy of the excitatory synaptic transmission require not only functional changes associated with the trafficking and activity of glutamate receptors but also structural remodeling of the dendritic morphology supporting rearrangements in the synaptic connections
To investigate whether the effect of PBN in the excitatory hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the AD model relies on structural synaptic modifications, we performed Golgi-Cox staining and obtained camera lucida drawings of hippocampal neurons from 6 m.o. of Wt and Tg mice and evaluated dendritic arborization as well as spine density.
As shown in Figure
The total length and the number of branch points of basal and apical dendrites (Figures
Remarkably, PBN antagonized all these effects, suggesting that Panx1 plays a critical role in the early structural synaptic defects observed in the hippocampal tissue of Tg brains.
It is noteworthy that PBN also increased dendritic arborization and spine density in hippocampal neurons from Wt animals, further indicating that Panx1 blockade promotes structural changes in neuronal and synaptic morphology.

The Blockade of Pannexin 1 With Probenecid Reduces p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Overactivation in Transgenic Hippocampal Tissue
A number of evidences demonstrate that the tau-kinase p38MAPK becomes overactive during normal aging as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD
Particularly, p38α-MAPK appears to mediate early neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and spatial memory defects in AD models
In fact, p38α-MAPK inhibition reduces the microglial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, improving synaptic and cognitive functions in Aβ-treated mice
In order to analyze whether the role of Panx1 in the synaptic dysfunction in Tg hippocampal tissue relies on the overactivation of p38MAPK, we measured the levels of p38MAPK phosphorylation (p-p38MAPK) in response to the PBN treatment.
As shown in Figure
Treatment with PBN significantly reduced p38MAPK phosphorylation, reaching values indistinguishable to those observed in the Wt tissue (Figure
These data strongly suggest that Panx1 activity is an upstream regulator of the p38MAPK signaling in AD.
To evaluate whether p38MAPK also influences Panx1 activation, we treated Wt and Tg hippocampal slices with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB, a drug that reportedly reverses Aβ-induced synaptic impairments in mice
As shown in Figure
These results suggest that a ''positive loop'' between Panx1 and p38MAPK exacerbates their activities, amplifying Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in AD (Figure

DISCUSSION
AD is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative condition manifested as a severe deterioration of cognitive functions
sAβos have been pointed as responsible for the synaptopathy that occurs early in the pathology, causing defects in neuronal morphology
Here, we show that Panx1, a nonselective transmembrane channel that connects intracellular and extracellular spaces (MacVicar and
In this regard, our data demonstrate that Panx1 is overexpressed in the hippocampal tissue of Tg compared to Wt mice (Figure
Remarkably, the age-dependent overexpression of Panx1 significantly correlates with the Aβ levels in Tg hippocampal tissue (Figure
Our results also show an exacerbated Panx1 activity in the hippocampal tissue of the Tg mice upon basal conditions (Figure
Other authors have suggested previously the involvement of Panx1 in the Aβ-induced neurotoxic signaling in the AD neuropathology.
How does Aβ signaling promote an aberrant function of Panx1 channels?
As proposed by
Moreover, Panx1 overactivity has also been involved in the Aβ-triggered degranulation of mast cells
In fact, although it has not been demonstrated in brains, pro-inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin (IL)-1β
Besides neuro-inflammation, the Aβ peptide can directly impact glutamate receptors, enhancing excitatory synaptic transmission.
Aβ signaling has been shown to affect synaptic plasticity by inhibiting LTP
Since Panx1 overactivation has been widely associated with aberrant glutamatergic transmission in several neuropathological conditions
In this regard, it has been demonstrated that Panx1 opening is triggered by the activation of NMDA and mGlu5 glutamate receptors, leading to epileptiform activity in hippocampal neurons
More recently, it was shown that Panx1 activity directly contributes to the generation of seizures in human epileptic brain tissues
Notably, in all these cases, the pharmacological blockade of Panx1 channels produces an anticonvulsant effect, suggesting that inhibiting Panx1 is an efficient strategy to ameliorate an exacerbated excitatory synaptic transmission.
In this regard, the observations that the Panx1 blocker PBN
In fact, acute treatment with PBN does not have a significant impact on neurodegeneration parameters such as Aβ deposition, astrogliosis, or neuronal death (Figure
In order to evaluate downstream effectors of the Panx1 overactivity, we estimated the activation of p38MAPK.
This tau kinase is overexpressed and becomes overactive during normal aging, as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD
Particularly, p38α-MAPK is overexpressed at early stages of AD neuropathology
Consequently, its inhibition reduces microglial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves synaptic and cognitive functions in Aβ-treated mice
In agreement with the fact that PBN improves LTP/LTD defects in Tg hippocampal slices (Figure
In 2017,
These authors showed that such effects rely on the reduction of Aβ accumulation
Interestingly, we do not observe a significant effect of PBN in the Aβ accumulation and deposition (Figures
Perhaps the impact of reducing p38MAPK activity on the Aβ aggregation requires a more long-lasting treatment such as the p38MAPK deletion reported by
Nonetheless, its acute inhibition manages to improve LTP defects in Aβ-treated brain slices
Interestingly, we also observe that the inhibition of p38MAPK with SB, a drug that reportedly reverses Aβ-induced synaptic impairments in mice
Since p38MAPK signaling modulates inflammatory cytokine production
Indeed, we observe that the treatment with the anti-Aβ drug DAPT, an inhibitor of the γ-secretase complex
Finally, our results show that the inhibition of Panx1 with PBN not only improves synaptic plasticity (Figure
These results are in agreement with our idea that targeting Panx1 overactivity is an efficient strategy to ameliorate early functional and structural synaptic defects in the AD context.
Surprisingly, PBN is also able to increase dendritic arborization, bringing the number of branches and dendritic length in Tg hippocampal neurons at levels similar to those exhibited by Wt neurons (Figure
Although dramatic, a rapid effect of PBN in neurite and axonal extension has been already demonstrated by other authors
Since we hypothesize that Panx1 overactivation contributes to the Aβinduced neurotoxic signaling by favoring p38MAPK activity, it is likely that this tau-kinase be involved in the effect of PBN on dendritic arborization.
In fact, p38MAPK activation was recently associated with the mechanisms that induce retardation in the axonal and dendritic outgrowth in offspring mice following maternal neuronal injury
As PBN efficiently reduces p38MAPK activation (current Figure
Consistent with our observations in spine density, it was recently shown that Panx1 negatively regulates cortical dendritic spine development and network connectivity
Which of the synaptic mechanisms governing the induction of synaptic plasticity could be impacted by an exacerbated Panx1 activity?
One possibility is neuronal actin network.
Actin is the most prominent cytoskeletal protein at synapses which is expressed in both axonal terminals and dendrites
It is highly enriched in dendritic spines where its organization and remodeling support structural modifications that accompany functional changes sustaining synaptic plasticity
Congruently, neuronal actin cytoskeleton dynamics are importantly perturbed in the AD context
Moreover, it has been reported that Aβ induces aberrant actin polymerization, affecting actin dynamics through a mechanism involving p38MAPK activity
Interestingly, Panx1 channels interact with actin filaments
This latter, added to our observations that PBN reverses a deficient dendritic branching and spine density in the Tg hippocampal tissue (Figure
Further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
According to our knowledge, this is the first time that Panx1 is described as a potential target in the early synaptotoxic signaling linked to AD.
Furthermore, we provide additional support to the current use of PBN as an emerging tool in clinical and basic research
PBN is a drug widely used clinically to treat gout and hyperuricemia and also used as a coadjutant to prolong the actions of antibiotic agents
However, it is necessary to note that PBN targets not only Panx1 channels but also other molecules highly expressed at the central nervous system (CNS).
Among them, the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1;
Therefore, side effects in brain tissue cannot be ruled out.
Nonetheless, PBN has been reported to protect from the excitotoxicity induced by sAβos
Interestingly, PBN can cross the blood-brain barrier, acting directly on the CNS
Moreover, recent studies reported that gout patients treated with different uricosurics including PBN, exhibit lower risk of developing nonvascular dementia
Although the direct effect of PBN on the cognitive status of AD patients has not yet been evaluated, the fact that in our conditions PBN has positive effects on the early synaptic defects observed in hippocampal tissue of Tg mice paves the way to evaluate in the future its impact on cognitive defects in the AD context.

FIGURE 6 |
FIGURE 6 | Proposed model for pannexin 1 (Panx1)'s role in AD synaptotoxicity.
Amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).
This processing is executed by the consecutive actions of β-secretase (not shown) and γ-secretase resulting in the release of a soluble β-cleaved APP fragment (sAPPβ) and the Aβ, respectively.
Aβ can form soluble oligomeric aggregates (sAβos) that easily diffuse and bind to several postsynaptic partners including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), enhancing glutamatergic transmission and promoting NMDAR/mGluR5-mediated activation of Panx1 channels.
Panx1 overactivity favors signaling cascades that promote the activation (phosphorylation) of p38-MAPK (p38MAPK), a kinase involved in the early stages of the Aβ-induced synaptic dysfunction in AD.
In turn, p38MAPK promotes Aβ production and accumulation, further increasing Panx1 overactivity and producing a "positive loop" that amplifies the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.
Congruently with this mechanism, the inhibition of Panx1 with probenecid (PBN) reverses p38MAPK activation and improves LTP/LTD and structural impairments in the AD model brain.
Similarly, inhibition of p38MAPK with SB208035 (SB) or the inhibition of γ-secretase-with N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) reduces Panx1 overactivity.
