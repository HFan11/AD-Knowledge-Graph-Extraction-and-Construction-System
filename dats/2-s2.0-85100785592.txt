Preclinical and clinical biomarker studies of CT1812: A novel approach to Alzheimer's disease modification
Introduction: Amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers are one of the most toxic structural forms of the Aβ protein and are hypothesized to cause synaptotoxicity and memory failure as they build up in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brain tissue.
We previously demonstrated that antagonists of the sigma-2 receptor complex effectively block Aβ oligomer toxicity.
CT1812 is an orally bioavailable, brain penetrant small molecule antagonist of the sigma-2 receptor complex that appears safe and well tolerated in healthy elderly volunteers.
We tested CT1812's effect on Aβ oligomer pathobiology in preclinical AD models and evaluated CT1812's impact on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein biomarkers in mild to moderate AD patients in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT02907567).
Methods: Experiments were performed to measure the impact of CT1812 versus vehicle on Aβ oligomer binding to synapses in vitro, to human AD patient post mortem brain tissue ex vivo, and in living APP Swe /PS1dE9 transgenic mice in vivo.
Additional experiments were performed to measure the impact of CT1812 versus vehicle on Aβ oligomer-induced deficits in membrane trafficking rate, synapse number, and protein expression in mature hippocampal/cortical neurons in vitro.
The impact of CT1812 on cognitive function was measured in transgenic Thy1 huAPP Swe/Lnd+ and wild-type littermates.
A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial was performed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and impact on protein biomarker expression of CT1812 or placebo given once daily for 28 days to AD patients (Mini-Mental State Examination 18-26).
CSF protein expression was measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease (AD) afflicts six million people in the United States, yet disease-modifying therapies remain an unmet medical need.
Investigational therapeutics are directed against a variety of potential targets, 1 but the amyloid hypothesis remains a compelling rationale for AD drug development.
More than 200 human mutations that cause early-onset familial AD have been identified, almost all conferring a single phenotype, increased amyloid beta (Aβ) protein concentration or ratio.
The only protective mutation that both significantly lowers AD incidence and also exhibits strong functional evidence of protection, A673T (the Icelandic mutation), also impacts the Aβ protein,
Previous therapeutics have not effectively targeted Aβ oligomers,
While monomeric Aβ binds to many receptors, the oligomeric form of Aβ has been shown to bind specifically and saturably to a single receptor site composed of LilRB2, Nogo receptor, and cellular prion proteins
After oligomer binding, synaptic protein expression and the number of spines and synapses are reduced,
Importantly, many preclinical studies suggest that after removal or reduction of the toxic oligomer species, synaptic protein expression, synapse number, and behavioral deficits can recover to normal levels.
re, we report the discovery and continued development of drug candidate CT1812, a brain penetrant small molecule that targets Aβ oligomers via a novel mechanism.
The first selective sigma-2 receptor antagonist to reach clinical trials,
The sigma-2 receptor complex plays a major role in cellular damage response mechanisms, with its constituent proteins regulating processes as diverse as autophagy, cholesterol synthesis and progesterone signaling, lipid membrane-bound protein trafficking, and receptor stabilization at the cell surface.
1]
In the present study, we report evidence supporting a hypothesized mechanism of CT1812 action: when CT1812 binds specifically to the sigma-2 receptor ligand binding site and allosterically modulates the sigma-2 receptor complex, it causes destabilization of the neighboring Aβ oligomer receptor binding sites, resulting in displacement of Aβ oligomers from their receptors (in other words, an increase in their "off rate").
This lowers Aβ oligomer affinity for synaptic receptors, mimicking the effect of the protective Icelandic mutation.
This disruption of oligomer binding has previously been associated with an improvement in membrane trafficking, neuronal surface expression of synaptic proteins, prevention of spine loss, and improvement in cognitive deficits in animal models of AD.
1812 is an investigational therapeutic that has not been approved for any use by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The risk-benefit profile of CT1812 will be evaluated after adequate placebo-controlled clinical trials have been completed.

RESULTS

CT1812 displaces and prevents Aβ oligomer binding
Previously published studies that described unbiased proprietary library screening to identify compounds that block Aβ oligomerinduced toxicity of intracellular lipid membrane trafficking rates revealed compound potency correlated with sigma-2 receptor affinity.
Medicinal chemistry optimization resulted in the design of CT1812.
CT1812 binds sigma-2 receptors with high affinity (Figure
CT1812 effectively prevented (EC50 = 6.7 μM) and reversed (EC50 = 0.36 μM) synthetic Aβ oligomer-induced membrane trafficking deficits in vitro in primary hippocampal/cortical cultures (21DIV, Figure
CT1812 prevented binding of Aβ oligomers to synaptic receptor sites on neurons (Aβ oligomer binding Kd = 0.43 μM, plus CT1812 = 1.12 μM,

CT1812 restores disease-related protein expression and synapse number in vitro
Aβ oligomers induce reversible spine retraction in vitro
The effect of CT1812-induced displacement of Aβ oligomers on oligomer-induced spine and synapse loss in cultured rat neurons was investigated using the cytoskeleton binding protein drebrin (expressed postsynaptically) as a marker of synapse number.
Addition of Aβ oligomers to neuronal cultures for 3 hours caused a significant loss (mean ± standard error of the mean 12.8% ± 2.6%, P < 0.01, two-tailed Student's t test, Figure
Aβ oligomer treatment led to a 28% loss of neurons expressing high levels of neurogranin (Figure
Treatment with CT1812 blocked this loss and restored expression of both proteins to control levels (Figure
This suggests that CT1812-mediated displacement of Aβ oligomers from neuronal synapses stops both downstream oligomer-induced synaptic protein downregulation and synapse loss, facilitating synaptic recovery from toxic oligomer insult.

CT1812 displaces Aβ oligomers and facilitates clearance into CSF in vivo and in AD patient brain tissue
To confirm the displacement of Aβ oligomers from cells observed in vitro using an in vivo mouse model of AD, we adapted a novel microimmunoelectrode (MIE) technology previously used to detect rapid kinetic changes in total Aβ concentration in brain interstitial fluid (ISF)
Using electrodes coated with the oligomer-specific antibody A11 41 placed in the hippocampus, Aβ oligomers were measured in ISF of 12-month-old APP Swe /PS1dE9 transgenic mice.
A single dose of CT1812 (0.3 μM, or 3.0 μM i.v.) resulted in a rapid and significant increase in Aβ oligomer levels in hippocampal ISF relative to predose baseline (Figure
In contrast, no increase was observed in the ISF of vehicle-treated transgenic mice.
The rapid elevation of Aβ
These results demonstrate that CT1812 displaces prebound Aβ oligomers from AD patient brain tissue.
Finally, the fate of Aβ oligomers displaced by CT1812 was determined by placing the A11-coated MIE in the lateral ventricle of transgenic APP Swe /PS1dE9 mice to measure Aβ oligomers in the CSF.
A significant, dose-dependent rise in Aβ oligomer levels was detected in CSF after drug administration (Figure
In contrast, Aβ monomer levels in the CSF were not affected by administration of CT1812 (Figure

CT1812 improves cognitive performance in transgenic mice
To assess whether this evidence of synapse preservation by CT1812 was associated with functional behavioral improvement, we evaluated changes in cognitive deficits in an aged transgenic mouse model of AD.
Treatment of WT mice with CT1812 did not significantly alter motor behavior and did not change cognitive performance compared to that of WT vehicle-treated animals.
As expected, significant deficits in transgenic vehicle-treated animals compared to WT vehicletreated animals were observed in the Activity Chamber test measuring exploration, the Y maze measuring spatial working memory, and the Fear Conditioning assays measuring aversive associative learning and memory.
Significant improvements in spatial learning and memory were observed in transgenic animals treated with CT1812 compared to those treated with vehicle in the Water Maze (Figure
In addition to improving spatial learning and memory, significant improvements were observed in hyperactivity as assessed via the Activity Chamber assay, and cue-dependent learning and memory as assessed in the Fear Conditioning assay.
In WT mice, CT1812 had no effect on performance in any of the cognitive tests (Figure
Previous studies of eight other sigma-2 receptor antagonists closely related to CT1812 in Thy1 huAPP Swe/Lnd+ mice treated daily for 4 weeks to 6 months indicated that behavioral improvements were observed as long as brain concentrations of drug were above a theoretical 80% receptor occupancy threshold concentration,
PK measurements of brain concentrations of CT1812 after treatment of Thy1 huAPP Swe/Lnd+ mice with 10 mg/kg p.o. for 9 to 10 weeks confirmed that this estimated 80% receptor occupancy level was achieved (Figure
ng/mL, 84.4% receptor occupancy, greater than four times the sigma-2 receptor Ki value).
Taken together, these studies indicate that threshold brain concentrations of CT1812 effectively improved cognitive deficits found in the huAPP Swe/Lnd+ mouse model of AD.

Clinical biomarker evidence of CT1812-mediated synapse protection and disease modification
After completion of first-in-man clinical studies (NCT02570997
All analytes shown are significantly regulated (P < 0.05) in AD patients vs. control
F, After 28 days of treatment, the abundance of six tau phosphorylation peptides decreased by 30% (the threshold for noise distribution), or more after treatment with CT1812 compared to placebo (T52, T205, S262, S263, S285, S305) while one site increased more than 30% (S191), but the concentration of unphosphorylated tau did not change, providing evidence of CT1812 impact on pathological disease signaling.
Colored bars represent amino acid sites within tau that are phosphorylated by GSK3β with priming (blue bars) or without priming (green bars)
Pathway analysis using three independent bioinformatics platforms (IPA Canonical Pathway [v51963813], Metacore [v19.4 build 69900], STRING [v11]) indicates that CT1812 significantly (P < 0.05) impacts synaptic-related pathways including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor trafficking, glycogen kinase synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), and Wnt signaling, as well as cytoskeletal reorganization.
Given the loss of synapses in AD patients along with the preclinical evidence that CT1812 rescues synapse number, we queried which proteins in the synaptic proteome
Twenty-five proteins in the synaptic proteome
To understand the functions of these proteins with respect to specific synaptic function in more detail, network analysis was performed.
The highest scoring network, Cell Morphology, Cellular Assembly and Organization, Cellular Development, comprised 14 out of 25 of the synaptic proteins, a significantly greater number than expected by random chance (Figure
This indicates that these proteins may play a role in dendritic branching, cytoskeletal remodeling, and neurotransmission (Figure
This provides evidence supporting CT1812's positive effect on synapses in patients with AD.
Out of 520 CSF proteins significantly altered in AD patients versus age-matched controls (P < 0.05) in a recent study,
Of those 334 proteins, a subset of 20 moved in the opposite direction (i.e., reversed AD-related changes) and were also significantly different in CT1812-treated compared to placebo (Figure
Several of these proteins are involved in key biological pathways known to be disrupted in AD, including cholesterol transport (apolipoprotein A2 [APOA2]), oxidative stress (ceruloplasmin [CP]), complement (complement C1r subcomponent-like protein [C1RL]), and synaptic transmission (14-3-3 protein beta/alpha [YWHAZ]).
This provides supporting evidence for a broad improvement of disease-related signaling by CT1812 in patients with AD.
One of the hallmarks of AD is hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which comprises neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).
5]
The abundance of six phosphorylation sites decreased by 30% or more (Figure
In agreement with these results, ELISA measurements of the change from baseline of phospho tau (p-tau) (181) and total tau (t-tau) was similar in CT1812-treated and placebo groups (Figure
Additionally, LC-MS/MS measurements of concentrations of kinases that phosphorylate tau, such as GSK3β, trended lower by 25% in CT1812-treated patients (not significantly different from placebo-treated patients, P = 0.098).
These results suggest that CT1812 may act upstream of tau kinases to reduce their concentration and resulting activity, while having no impact on tau expression or regulation.
To identify phosphorylation sites within tau that might covary in abundance in response to CT1812 treatment, correlation analyses were performed and a heatmap was generated.
The abundance of 21 pairs of p-tau sites was found to be significantly correlated with one another (Figure
Taken together, these clinical biomarker data support a potential therapeutic impact of CT1812 in patients with AD.

DISCUSSION

CT1812 displaces Aβ oligomers in several preclinical models of AD
The Aβ oligomer hypothesis remains a compelling rationale for AD drug development programs.
Supporting evidence for this comes from the genetic determinants of autosomal dominant AD and AD complicating Down syndrome,
Drug development programs targeting Aβ include active and passive Aβ immunotherapeutics
The current study demonstrates that CT1812 displaces Aβ oligomers from neurons with three independent approaches: in vitro cell culture, in vivo rodent studies (including two different mouse models of AD), and ex vivo human brain CSF and tissue.
In cultured rat brain cells in vitro, CT1812 shifted the binding of exogenously applied, synthetic Aβ oligomers to lower affinity whether added before or after oligomers.
Importantly, CT1812-mediated reduction of oligomer affinity phenocopies or mimics the effect of the AD's protective Icelandic mutation on oligomer affinity,
This is significant because drug candidates with the same mechanism as protective variants are expected to have a higher success rate in the clinic.
CT1812 treatment for 1 hour did not decrease the intensity of pre-bound Aβ oligomers as completely as it did when added to cultures prior to the oligomers.
It is possible that longer treatment with CT1812 can achieve a greater level of displacement.
However, incubation with Aβ oligomers for longer times results in internalization of a portion of the Aβ oligomer labeling,
Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that CT1812 both displaces already-bound Aβ oligomers and prevents the binding of Aβ oligomers to neuronal synaptic receptors; displaced oligomers will not re-bind as long as CT1812 remains present.
Thus, CT1812 will likely continue to exert its effect as concentrations of oligomers rise throughout the course of AD.
In separate biochemical assays using an oligomer-specific ELISA, CT1812 does not interact directly with oligomers and did not disrupt preformed oligomers or block oligomer formation (Figure
In post mortem human AD brain tissue sections, CT1812 caused a concentration-dependent increase in Aβ displaced from the tissue as measured by Aβ ELISA, as well as a concentrationdependent increase in several oligomeric species of Aβ as detected by western blot analysis of the material displaced from the tissue.
is was accompanied by a decrease in Aβ within the tissue section in the 2 micron oligomer-enriched halo surrounding plaques.
While we cannot rule out compound-mediated displacement of oligomers from extrasynaptic sites that are below the level of detection of our imaging methods, oligomers that are dose-dependently displaced by CT1812 are highly likely to originate from synaptic receptor sites; because oligomers are water-soluble, oligomers in the interstitial fluid in these frozen tissue sections should freely diffuse in any aqueous media and be detectable in the vehicle treated condition as well (Figure
Previously tested closely related sigma-2 receptor antagonists do not impact monomer or fibril levels in Thy1 huAPP Swe/Lnd+ transgenic mice after chronic short-term administration.
To more fully explore the role of these proteins in AD, future studies (including studies in AD mouse models cross-bred with conditional tissue-specific knockouts of each protein to avoid lethality) are required.
We hypothesize that displacement of toxic Aβ oligomers from synaptic receptor sites and clearance of oligomer into the CSF underlies the improvement of cognitive performance in transgenic AD mice seen with chronic CT1812 administration.
As with other closely related sigma-2 receptor antagonists,
While CT1812's in vitro assay EC50 values range from high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations, behavioral improvement is observed at brain concentrations closer to CT1812's Ki at sigma-2 receptors (8.5 nM).
The basis for this difference is unclear but may be due to the short duration and high concentrations of synthetic Aβ oligomers used in the in vitro assays.
Once displaced from synaptic receptors, the oligomers are no longer able to harm synapses and are subject to elimination through yet to be defined clearance pathways.

Preliminary biomarker evidence for CT1812 target engagement and disease-modification in patients with AD
Protein measurements of CSF samples from the 28-day clinical trial COG0102 provide preliminary evidence of target engagement and potential impact on disease in mild-to-moderate AD patients consistent with preclinical data.
CSF concentrations of Aβ oligomers increase in CT1812-treated patients versus placebo similar to preclinical studies, indicating that CT1812 displaces and clears toxic Aβ oligomer from the brain into CSF.
CSF concentrations of the postsynaptic dendritic protein neurogranin, typically significantly elevated in AD patients,
Additionally, several synaptic proteins are significantly different in CT1812-versus placebo-treated patients; bioinformatics analysis of these changes support preclinical evidence of a positive impact of CT1812 on synaptic pathways.

Analysis of CSF concentrations of phosphorylated tau fragments in
AD patients revealed that treatment with CT1812 induced a broad reduction in tau phosphorylation at multiple amino acid sites without affecting unphosphorylated tau concentration.
Many of the residues altered by CT1812 treatment have been previously implicated in ADrelated changes.
3]

Preclinical evidence demonstrates that Aβ oligomer binding results
in upregulation of tau kinase activity 2 leading to tau phosphorylation at multiple sites.
The observed reduction in GSK3β as well as tau phosphorylation in CT1812-treated patients provides the first clinical biomarker evidence supporting the Aβ oligomer hypothesis of AD and further support of CT1812's disease-modifying mechanism of action.
We hypothesize that changes in CSF concentration of a subset of proteins with CT1812 treatment reflect target engagement in the brain.
Further clinical studies with longer treatment duration are underway; treatment-related impact on biomarkers in these independent clinical cohorts will provide additional insight on CT1812 target engagement and AD pathobiology as well as insight into how covariates like sex, age, and apolipoprotein E status impact response to drug.
The effects of these changes in CSF protein concentrations on cognition and health is unknown and the relative benefit of these effects F I G U R E 6 Hypothesized mechanism of action of CT1812: synaptoprotective displacement of toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers from neurons.
A, In the absence of Aβ oligomers, pre-and post-synaptic proteins such as synaptotagmin-1 and neurogranin are expressed at normal levels.
B, The sigma-2 receptor complex tightly regulates the oligomer receptor complex by stabilizing plasma membrane expression of oligomer receptor component proteins.
C, Oligomer binding results in changing expression/localization of synapse associated proteins, spine loss, and memory failure, as well as upregulation of the sigma-2 receptor complex.
D, Fragmented pre-and post-synaptic proteins such as synaptotagmin-1 and neurogranin move into interstitial fluid and then cerebrospinal fluid.
E, CT1812 binds to the sigma-2 receptor ligand binding site within the sigma-2 receptor complex, acting as a negative allosteric modulator of Aβ oligomer binding.
This destabilizes the oligomer binding site and displaces oligomers from synapses without affecting normal synapse protein function.
F, Synapse number and memory are restored to normal levels compared to the risks of the drug are being determined in ongoing and future placebo-controlled clinical trials.

CT1812 for the treatment of AD
The hypothesized disease-modifying mechanism of action of CT1812 is illustrated in Figure
In the normal brain (Figure
In AD, Aβ oligomers bind to their receptor, altering its function and/or protein interactions, and resulting in a compensatory upregulation of the sigma-2 receptor complex (Figure
The binding of Aβ oligomers then leads to synaptic damage and release of presynaptic and postsynaptic pro-teins such as neurogranin and synaptotagmin-1 into the ISF and CSF (Figure
CT1812 binds to and allosterically modulates the sigma-2 receptor (Figure
CT1812 is thus a negative allosteric modulator of Aβ oligomer binding to synaptic receptors.
As a result of the removal of toxic oligomers, synapse number and memory are restored to normal (Figure
CT1812 selectively displaces Aβ oligomers shortly after entering the brain and prevents them from rebinding as long as brain drug levels remain above an estimated 80% receptor occupancy.
Chronic administration provides sustained protection from the synaptotoxic oligomer assault, facilitating synaptic recovery.
The current studies suggest that CT1812 effectively and selectively targets Aβ oligomers by a novel mechanism of action not previously demonstrated for any other therapeutics currently in development.
CT1812 is both the first selective sigma-2 receptor antagonist to be used in clinical trials, and the first therapeutic demonstrated to displace toxic Aβ oligomers from synaptic receptor sites and selectively facilitate their clearance into the CSF.
Displacement of oligomers lowers their binding affinity (K D ) to synaptic receptors significantly, thus CT1812 is the only therapeutic currently in development that mimics the effect of the protective Icelandic A673T mutation.
This mechanism is significant, as therapeutics that recapitulate the effects of protective mutations have a track record of clinical success.
rrently, approved AD medications do not stop the disease course, but simply treat symptoms for a limited time.
These preclinical results of CT1812 in rodent models of AD demonstrate that CT1812 blocks Aβ oligomer binding to neurons, reduces synapse loss, restores synaptic protein expression, facilitates oligomer clearance into the CSF, and restores cognitive function.
The ability of CT1812 to improve cognitive performance in transgenic mice while not affecting the performance of WT mice supports a specific effect of CT1812 on the pathological pathway of AD: this disease-selective mechanism may provide an advantage over other therapeutic approaches that impact brain function more widely.
Preliminary evidence from the phase 1b/2a clinical trial reported here supports these findings.
This study was limited by small patient numbers and short duration of treatment in the COG0102 trial.
Larger studies with additional dose levels will be required to establish doseresponse relationships with biomarker changes, and distinguish both acute and long-term disease-modifying effects of CT1812 treatment.
While not all proteins and signaling pathways known to be dysregulated in AD were affected by treatment with CT1812, several pathways were significantly impacted (including cholesterol transport, oxidative stress, complement, and synaptic transmission; Figure
Together, these results provide encouraging evidence of the impact of CT1812 on multiple aspects of disease in AD patients and support further development of this drug candidate so that the relative benefit and risks of CT1812 can be more thoroughly evaluated.

Aβ oligomer preparation
Synthetic human Aβ1-42 peptide was prepared as previously described.
Briefly, peptide was treated according to published methods to remove any structural assemblies.
An Aβ monomer film was prepared, dissolved, diluted to 100 μM, and incubated at 4 • C to form oligomers.
The resulting preparations were centrifuged to remove any insoluble fibrils, and the supernate added to cultures.
All studies using synthetic oligomers were performed with this preparation unless otherwise specified.
All lots of Aβ1-42 are put through a strict quality control processes, described previously,
As previously reported, oligomers produced via this method typically range from 25-275 kDa when measured via non-denatured western blots (Figure
Human AD patient-(Braak V/VI) and age-matched control hippocampal brain specimens, less than 24 hours post mortem, were obtained from the Brown Brain Bank following previously described procedures.
Tissue was prepared as previously described.
iefly, the brain tissue was homogenized and centrifuged, supernate were immuno-depleted and concentrated to obtain the 10-100 kDa size-fractionated oligomers, which were then captured on 6E10-conjugated agarose columns (Pierce).
The released material was desalted and stored at -

In vitro Aβ binding assay
Assessment of Aβ oligomer binding was performed as previously described.
Briefly, cultures were either (for prevention studies) treated with CT1812 for 30 minutes, followed by synthetic Aβ1-42 oligomer preparation for 60 minutes, or (for displacement studies) treated with oligomers 30 minutes prior to the addition of CT1812.
Cells were then fixed and labeled for immunofluorescent microscopy as previously described.

Human tissue ex vivo Aβ displacement
Displacement of Aβ from human tissue was assessed as previously described.

Western blot analysis of Aβ oligomers
Non-denaturing western blot conditions were used to avoid the generation of Aβ assembly and disassembly artifacts, as previously described.
Briefly, baseline and end of study CSF samples from AD patients participating in clinical trial COG0102 were collected in polypropylene tubes in 500 μL and frozen at -80 • C until analysis.
Upon receipt, the samples were thawed and quickly aliquoted into polypropylene tubes coated with isotonic human serum albumin and refrozen until analysis by native western gels.
Because the effects of blood on Aβ oligomer formation in CSF is unknown, an aliquot of each patient sample was pre-analyzed on a western blot using luminol and horseradish peroxide to test for the presence of heme.
Final western gel analysis was performed on samples excluding those containing hemolyzed blood.
Samples were run on Tris-HCl nondenaturing gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 82E1 mouse monoclonal Aβ antibody (IBL America) and visualized by chemiluminescence after detection using a goat anti mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Millipore).
All reagents were filtered through 0.1 micron filters to eliminate background debris.
Band intensities on the gels were quantified using an Alpha Innotech image system and Alpha View software (ProteinSimple).
Each patient's sample at day 28 was normalized as a percent of that patient's own baseline value.

Measurement of Aβ using microimmunoelectrodes
APP/PS1+/-hemizygous mice
Male and female littermate mice were distributed between experimental groups.
MIEs, which can measure Aβ every 60 seconds for up to 3 hours, were prepared similar to previously described methods.
Carbon fiber microelectrodes were used as the platform sensor due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, biological compatibility, and miniature size,
Electrodes were coated with antibodies specific for Aβ monomer (HJ2)
Electrodes were pre-calibrated in vitro (see supporting information).
In addition to the MIE, a stainless-steel bone screw used as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (InVivo Metrics) were implanted into the brains of 12-month-old APP/PS1+/-transgenic mice.
All electrodes were stereotaxically implanted under isofluorane anesthesia.
Mice were placed on a heating pad to maintain body  To measure brain concentration of drugs, brains were homogenized in 1 mL PBS per gram of brain tissue using a handheld homogenizer.
Brain homogenate was then extracted with three volumes of ice-cold methanol on ice for 15 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes.
The supernates were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Samples were compared to a calibration curve prepared in a similar manner by spiking blank control homogenate with standards prepared in DMSO and then extracted as above.

CT1812 did not block the formation of Aβ oligomers or disrupt their formation at concentrations up to 20μM (Figure S2 in supporting information), suggesting that its ability to stop Aβ oligomer binding and trafficking deficits results from CT1812 direct binding to sigma-2 receptors.

For all cell culture experiments, n represents the number of replicate experiments from separate cell culture preparations, and data points represent means ± SD or SEM as noted per neuron compared to vehicle treatment.
This is similar to the degree of synapse loss seen using ultrastructural stereology methods in post mortem hippocampus from humans diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. 39
CT1812 prevented oligomer-induced synapse loss in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 68 nM, P < 0.05, paired, Student's t test of treated vs. vehicle, Figure 2F bottom, G).
Furthermore, addition of CT1812 to cultures 1 hour after the addition of Aβ oligomers resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of synaptic number to normal levels (EC50 = 127 nM, Figure 2G).
Examination of synaptic protein expression corroborated these results.

For western blots, the sum of the intensity of discrete Aβ protein bands at 22, 33, 43, 48, and 85 Kd was quantified for each donor tissue section (C).

oligomers after drug administration declined to baseline levels within the timeframe of the recording (120 minutes).
In contrast, total Aβ levels (primarily monomer) in the hippocampal ISF were not affected by the administration of CT1812 (Figure 3B), thus CT1812 selectively from the same donor are shown, with the mean of all the points represented by the horizontal lines (*P < 0.05, ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test for each treatment vs. vehicle treated controls).

To assess whether CT1812 displacement of Aβ oligomers in AD model systems in vitro and in vivo may also occur in AD patients, we conducted ex vivo binding experiments in 10 μM-thick post mortem neocortical tissue sections obtained from patients with AD (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 3, n = 8 patients, Figure 3C-E).
After incubation of adjacent sections in identical volumes containing increasing concentrations of CT1812 or vehicle, the supernate was removed and the levels of Aβ displaced from the tissue sections quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the Aβ remaining in the tissue sections was quantified via immunofluorescent microscopy.
Analysis of the displaced material by ELISA for total Aβ showed that ascending concentrations of CT1812 increased the amount of Aβ released from the human brain tissue (Figure 3D): non-denaturing western blots confirmed this material to be Aβ oligomers (Figure 3C, E, Figure S4 in supporting information).
Additionally, CT1812 induced a concentration-dependent decrease in Aβ oligomer immunofluorescence intensity in the 2 μm region containing high concentrations of oligomers surrounding dense, thioflavin-S labeled plaque cores


), CT1812 was advanced into clinical trials in AD patients.
Mild-tomoderate AD patients with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores of 18 to 26 were randomized to receive one of three doses of CT1812 (90, 280, 560 mg) or placebo once daily for 28 days (N = 19, 4-5/group) in a double-blind phase 1b/2a clinical trial to determine safety and tolerability (trial COG0102, for full description, see clinicaltrials.gov
NCT02907567).
The randomized patients, 10 male and 9 female, had a mean age of 70.2 years (standard deviation [SD] 9.2) and body mass index of 24.75 kg/m 2 (SD 2.73).
CSF concentrations at baseline and Day 28 confirmed no presence of CT1812 in the placebo group or at baseline in any dose group.
Day 28 mean CSF concentrations of CT1812 rose in a dose-dependent manner (1.15 ng/mL [SD 0.53] in the 90 mg treatment group, 2.84 ng/mL [SD 0.69] in the 280 mg treatment group, and 4.96 [SD 8.49] in the 560 mg treatment group).
As expected in a study of limited treatment duration, change in exploratory measures of cognitive function from baseline was similar in CT1812-treated and placebo groups.
CSF samples collected from each patient at baseline and at the end of study were used for protein measurements using targeted (i.e., ELISA, western blot, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS) and nontargeted (i.e., unbiased LC-MS/MS proteomics) methods; missing samples and variable sample volumes reduced the number of matched baseline and day 28 patient CSF samples available for subsequent analysis.
Protein gel electrophoresis (western blot) was used to measure Aβ oligomer concentration in CSF samples from each patient taken at Day F I G U R E 4 Treatment with CT1812 improves learning and memory deficits in transgenic Alzheimer's mice.
A, Transgenic Thy-1 huAPPSwe/Ldn+ male mice treated with CT1812 (Tg + CT1812) learn the Morris water maze task significantly better than do transgenic vehicle-treated mice (Tg + vehicle; P = 0.016, two-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni post hoc *P < 0.5; mean ± standard error of the mean).
CT1812 treatment does not affect non-transgenic animal performance (nTg + CT1812).

C, Transgenic mice show deficits in the Contextual Fear Conditioning test (P = 0.037, Student's t test), while transgenic and nontransgenic mice treated with CT1812 do not (nTg + vehicle, 52.5 ± SD 5.4%; Tg + vehicle, 37.9 ± SD 6.4%; Tg + CT1812, 44.6 ± SD 6.5%; nTg + CT1812, 50.9 ± SD 5.1%).
Each data point in (B) and (C) represents an individual mouse with the mean of all the points represented by the horizontal lines.
D, Plasma and brain concentration of CT1812 after a single p.o. dose of 10 mg/kg (n = 3 mice per time point, mean ± SD) 0 and 28 and percent change for each patient was calculated.
Due to the small number of AD patients in each dosing group, CT1812 dose groups were pooled for comparisons to placebo.
After 28 days of treatment, CSF Aβ oligomer concentration (n = 3) in placebo-treated patients trended lower from levels at their own baseline, while levels in CT1812-treated patients (n = 10) increased significantly compared to placebo-treated patients (Figure 5A and Figure S5 in supporting information).
This finding is consistent with preclinical studies indicating that CT1812 displaces and clears toxic Aβ oligomers from the brain into CSF (Figure 3I) and provides supporting evidence of clinical target engagement.
In contrast, Aβ40 and 42 monomer levels measured with ELISA were not different between Day 0 and Day 28, or between treatment groups in this trial (Figure S5B, C).
The concentrations of several synaptic and axonal proteins are elevated in CSF of AD patients compared to age-matched cognitively normal individuals as a result of central nervous system synaptic damage due to the disease; 47-51 some markers exhibit greater sensitivity to disease-related changes than do others.
We measured concentrations of synaptic and axonal proteins in CSF samples from AD patients in trial COG0102 using ELISA (neurogranin and neurofilament light [NfL]) or targeted LC-MS/MS (synaptotagmin-1, SNAP-25).
At 28 days, CSF concentrations of neurogranin and SYT-1 decreased in CT1812-treated AD patients relative to placebo-treated AD patients CSF (Figure 5B, neurogranin, n = 5 placebo, 11 treated; P = 0.050 analysis of covariance; Figure 5C, synaptotagmin-1, n = 4 placebo, 9 treated; F1,12 = 8.8, P = 0.011, linear mixed model), consistent with preclinical evidence of CT1812-mediated facilitation of synaptic recovery from insult with toxic Aβ oligomers.
CSF concentrations of NfL and SNAP-25 did not change to a significant degree in CT1812-treated AD patients versus placebo (Figure S5D, G).
Data from unbiased LC-MS/MS proteomics measurements of CSF were evaluated for effects on synaptic proteins (Figure 5D).
Of the 3160 proteins detected in the CSF of this patient cohort, the abundance of 315 proteins was significantly different between F I G U R E 5 CT1812 treatment significantly impacts cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of target engagement and disease-related biology.
Protein concentrations in CSF samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in a 28-day phase 1b/2a clinical trial of CT1812 vs. placebo were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), or gel electrophoresis.
A, After 28 days the concentration of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers measured via western blot in CT1812-treated AD patient CSF increases compared to the patient's own baseline and vs. placebo (P = 0.014, Student's t test, n = 3 placebo, 10 CT1812-treated), providing supporting evidence of clinical target engagement.
At day 28 of the study, the concentration of synaptic damage proteins neurogranin (B, measured by ELISA) and synaptotagmin-1 (C, measured by LC-MS/MS) decreases compared to the patient's own baseline and vs. placebo (P = 0.050 analysis of covariance, n = 5 placebo, 11 CT1812-treated; and F1,12 = 8.8, P = 0.011, n = 4 placebo, 9 CT1812-treated, respectively) providing evidence of a positive effect on synapses in patients with AD.
A, B, and C, Data from individual patients are displayed with the treatment group mean represented by the horizontal lines.
These changes are corroborated (D) by significant expression changes (P < 0.05) in multiple synaptic proteome proteins in the CSF measured by unbiased LC-MS/MS in AD patients treated for 28 days with CT1812 vs. placebo.

).
The transgenic mouse MIE measurements provide additional insight on the selectivity of CT1812's effect on oligomers: a single dose of CT1812 rapidly increased concentrations of Aβ oligomer, but not Aβ monomer in the brain.
Together, these results demonstrate that CT1812 is a dose-dependent, negative allosteric modulator of Aβ oligomer binding.
Unexpectedly, these same measurements provided evidence suggesting that CT1812 directly or indirectly facilitates clearance of Aβ oligomer, but not monomer, out of the brain and into the CSF; it rapidly increases ISF and CSF concentrations of oligomers in a dosedependent manner, but not monomers.
The difference in kinetic rate of increase in Aβ oligomer concentration between the hippocampus and lateral ventricle may result from different electrode sampling volumes due to diffusion constraints within brain tissue compared to CSF.
The basis for this selective clearance of Aβ oligomers but not monomers is currently unclear.
While mechanisms of Aβ monomer clearance from the brain into CSF have been studied extensively (reviewed in Yuede et al. 40 ), oligomer clearance mechanisms are currently unknown.


CT1812 is currently being studied in four randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase 2 studies (6 months-1 year in treatment duration) in patients with mild to moderate AD: SNAP (NCT03522129), SPARC (NCT03493282), SHINE (NCT03507790), and SEQUEL.
An additional 18-month study in 540 early AD patients (MMSE 20-30) is being planned in collaboration with the ACTC clinical trial network.
The safety and tolerability of CT1812 will continue to be explored in all clinical trials.
