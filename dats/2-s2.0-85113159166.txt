YAP prevents premature senescence of astrocytes and cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease through regulating CDK6 signaling
Senescent astrocytes accumulate with aging and contribute to brain dysfunction and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the mechanisms underlying the senescence of astrocytes during aging remain unclear.
In the present study, we found that Yes-associated Protein (YAP) was downregulated and inactivated in hippocampal astrocytes of aging mice and AD model mice, as well as in D-galactose and paraquat-induced senescent astrocytes, in a Hippo pathway-dependent manner.
Conditional knockout of YAP in astrocytes significantly promoted premature senescence of astrocytes, including reduction of cell proliferation, hypertrophic morphology, increase in senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and upregulation of several senescence-associated genes such as p16, p53 and NF-κB, and downregulation of Lamin B1.
Further exploration of the underlying mechanism revealed that the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was decreased in YAP knockout astrocytes in vivo and in vitro, and ectopic overexpression of CDK6 partially rescued YAP knockout-induced senescence of astrocytes.
Finally, activation of YAP signaling by XMU-MP-1 (an inhibitor of Hippo kinase MST1/2) partially rescued the senescence of astrocytes and improved the cognitive function of AD model mice and aging mice.
Taken together, our studies identified unrecognized functions of YAP-CDK6 pathway

| INTRODUC TI ON
As one of the most important body organs, the brain is particularly sensitive to aging
Brain aging is accompanied by a decline in various cognitive functions
In addition, the risk for aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)
Therefore, how to delay brain aging and prevent aging-related diseases is critical for human health.
Brain aging begins with the senescence of cells in the brain.
Recent studies have shown that astrocytic specific genes alter their expression patterns in human hippocampus during aging
Interestingly, astrocytic senescence has been proposed as a component of AD
Clearance of these senescent glial cells prevents tau-dependent pathology and cognitive hypofunction
Senescent astrocytes usually exhibit large, flat, and vacuolated cell morphology, elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβ-Gal) activity, attenuated cell proliferation and accumulation of p16
Although some molecules such as glutamine synthetase (Y.
The Hippo signaling pathway is a key regulator of stem cell selfrenewal, tissue regeneration and organ size, and is a conserved classical pathway formed by the kinase cascade (F.
X.
As a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, YAP has been shown to play an important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and tissue regeneration
Recent evidence has shown that YAP signaling is closely related to individual aging and cellular senescence
YAP-1 deficiency promotes health aging of Caenorhabditis elegans
However, it remains unclear whether YAP signaling regulates the senescence of astrocytes in aged brain and AD.
In the present study, we found that YAP was downregulated and inactivated in senescent astrocytes in vitro and in vivo, and YAP prevented the senescence of astrocytes through the CDK6 signaling.
Our study provides a new molecular mechanism for regulating astrocytic senescence, which may provide new insights and targets for delaying brain aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases.

| RE SULTS

| YAP is downregulated and inactivated in hippocampal astrocytes of aged mice and AD model mice
To explore the potential functions of YAP in the aging brain, hippocampal tissues of 2 M and 24 M old mice were collected.
SAβ-gal staining, which is a classical method for testing cell or tissue senescence
In these hippocampus of 24 M old mice, the protein levels of YAP were significantly decreased, as well as the decrease in Lamin B1 (a senescent marker) levels, which is a common feature of senescent cells
Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of the Hippo kinases such as LATS1, MST1, MOB1 and YAP were increased significantly in old mice, compared with that in young mice (Figure
These results suggest that YAP is downregulated and inactivated in aged brains in a Hippo pathway-dependent manner.
Our previous studies have shown that YAP is mainly expressed in astrocytes and neural stem cells of the brain (Z.
Indeed, as shown in Figure
To further confirm whether YAP is also downregulated and inactivated in aging-related diseases such as AD, YAP expression was detected in the hippocampal tissues of APP/PS1 mice (Figure
As shown in Figure

| YAP is downregulated and inactivated in the naturally senescent astrocytes and D-galactose (Dgal) or paraquat (PQ)-induced senescent astrocytes in vitro
To further examine the expression pattern of YAP in senescent astrocytes, the primary astrocytes were cultured to DIV 90, which is considered as naturally senescent astrocytes
To further investigate the functions of YAP in pathological senescent astrocytes, D-galinduced senescent astrocyte models (Y.
In our system, primary cultured astrocytes were treated with D-gal at 111 mM for 5 days, and then SAβ-gal staining confirmed the senescence of astrocytes (Figure
Moreover, mRNA levels of p16 (a senescent marker) were significantly increased in these senescent astrocytes (Figure
In addition, these astrocytes showed hypertrophic morphology, reduction of cell proliferation and decrease in Lamin B1 expression (Figure
Moreover, consistent with our results in vivo, YAP expression was significantly downregulated, however, p-YAP level and p-YAP/YAP ratio were increased in these D-gal-induced senescent astrocytes, as well as increase in p53 expression (a senescent marker) and decrease in Lamin B1 expression (Figure
qPCR analysis showed that the secretion of SASP factors, such as IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-3, were increased in senescent astrocytes (Figure
Furthermore, immunostaining also showed that YAP level was decreased in these senescent astrocytes (Figure
These results suggest that YAP is downregulated and inactivated in D-gal-induced senescent astrocytes.
To further confirm our results, another senescent astrocyte model was established as reported previously
Young astrocytes were treated with PQ for 24 h, then, PQ was removed from the culture medium, and the astrocytes were recovered for another 8 days (Figure
As shown in Figure
Similarly, in these senescent astrocytes, YAP expression was significantly reduced, whereas p-YAP level and p-YAP/YAP ratio were increased, as well as the increase in p53 level and decrease in Lamin B1 level
Furthermore, immunostaining also showed decrease in YAP expression in PQ-induced senescent astrocytes (Figure
To determine whether the inactivation of YAP in senescent astrocytes in vitro is dependent on activation of the Hippo pathway, the protein levels of Hippo kinases were detected.
As shown in Figure
Moreover, mRNA levels of LATS1, MST1, and SAV1 were significantly decreased (Figure
Taken together, these results suggest that YAP is downregulated and inactivated both in the naturally senescent astrocytes and D-gal-or PQ-induced senescent astrocytes in a Hippo pathway-dependent manner.

| YAP deletion in astrocytes promotes the premature senescence of astrocytes in vitro and in vivo
To examine the roles of YAP in senescent astrocytes, YAP GFAP -CKO mice (conditionally knockout YAP in astrocytes) were generated, by crossing YAP f/f mice with GFAP-cre transgenic mice.
Both western blot and immunostaining showed that YAP was efficiently knockout in YAP GFAP -CKO mice and cultured YAP -/-astrocytes (Figure
Interestingly, SAβ-gal staining showed that the percentage of β-galactosidase positive cells was increased in YAP -/-astrocytes (Figure
Moreover, YAP deletion significantly reduced the proliferation of astrocytes (Figure
Deletion of YAP in astrocytes significantly aggravated D-gal-induced senescence of astrocytes (Figure
Moreover, more significant increase in β-galactosidase positive cells and more potent reduction of Lamin B1 were found in YAP -/-astrocytes, which suggest that YAP -/-astrocytes was more vulnerable to senescence induction, compared with YAP +/+ astrocytes (Figure
These results suggest that YAP deletion promotes the premature senescence of astrocytes in vitro.
Again, in the hippocampus of old YAP f/f mice, the expression of YAP and Lamin B1 was significantly decreased, and p53 expression was significantly increased, compared with that in young YAP f/f mice.
As expected, in YAP GFAP -CKO mice, p53 expression was significantly increased than that in young YAP f/f mice and old YAP f/f mice, however, Lamin B1 expression was significantly decreased (Figure
Immunohistochemistry showed that in the hippocampus of old YAP GFAP -CKO mice, the expression of Lamin B1 was significantly decreased in GFAP positive astrocytes, compared to old YAP f/f mice, but not in GFAP negative cells (Figure
Taken together, these results suggest that YAP deletion promotes the premature senescence of astrocytes in vitro and in vivo.

| YAP prevents premature senescence of astrocytes through the CDK6 pathway
How does YAP prevent the senescence of astrocytes?
Previous studies have reported that knockdown of YAP promotes the senescence of IMR-90 cells through negatively regulating CDK6, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase (Q.
In the hippocampus of old YAP f/f mice, the expression of YAP and CDK6 were significantly decreased, compared with that in young YAP f/f mice, interestingly, YAP and CDK6 expression were decreased in old YAP GFAP -CKO mice, compared with that in old YAP f/f mice (Figure
Moreover, the protein levels of YAP and CKD6 were significantly decreased in AD model mice, compared with that in WT mice (Figure
These results indicate that the YAP-CDK6 signaling is downregulated in aged mice and AD model mice.
To further examine whether CDK6 is a target gene of YAP downstream to regulate the senescence of astrocytes, YAP +/+ and YAP -/-astrocytes were cultured.
Real-time PCR and western blot showed that both mRNA and protein level of CDK6 were significantly decreased in YAP -/-astrocytes, respectively, not only in control astrocytes, but also in D-gal-induced senescent astrocytes (Figure
Furthermore, overexpression of CDK6 partially rescued D-gal-induced senescence of YAP -/-astrocytes (Figure
Taken together, these results suggest that YAP prevents the senescence of astrocytes through the CDK6 pathway.

| Activation of YAP by suppressing the Hippo pathway delays the senescence of astrocytes and improves the cognitive function of aged mice and AD model mice
To investigate whether activation of YAP delays the senescence of astrocytes in vitro, XMU-MP-1, an inhibitor of Hippo kinase MST1/2
As expected, the percentage of β-galactosidase positive cells was significantly decreased by XMU-MP-1 treatment in D-gal-induced senescence of YAP +/+ astrocytes, however, it failed to rescue the D-gal-induced senescence of YAP -/-astrocytes, indicating that activation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 ameliorated the senescence of astrocytes (Figure
Furthermore, western blot showed that YAP, CDK6 and Lamin B1 expression were also significantly increased, however, p-YAP/YAP level was decreased by XMU-MP-1 treatment in D-gal-induced senescent astrocytes (Figure
In addition, these XMU-MP-1-treated astrocytes showed increased percentage of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation) positive astrocytes (Figure
Interestingly, CP-10 (a CDK6 inhibitor) promotes the senescence of astrocytes at basal level (Figure

| DISCUSS ION
In the present study, we found that YAP signaling was downregu- Previous studies have shown that YAP is downregulated in IMR90 cells during senescence and knockdown of YAP promotes premature senescence of IMR90 cells (Q.
Consistent with these previous results, we found that YAP was downregulated and inactivated in senescent astrocytes in vivo and in vitro in a Hippo pathway-dependent manner.
We also note that one previous study has shown that the nuclear YAP was remarkably decreased in neurons under AD pathology due to the sequestration into cytoplasmic amyloid beta aggregates, which indicates YAP-dependent neuronal necrosis in AD
However, in our studies, we found that YAP was mainly tau aggregates, and drive neurodegenerative disease
Interestingly, beta-amyloid triggered senescence of astrocytes in vitro, which implied mutual promotion of astrocyte senescence and beta-amyloid deposition
Senescent astrocytes express a characteristic of SASP, which in turn could elicit deleterious effects on the surrounding neurons, disturb the maintenance of homeostasis in brain, in large part, contribute to age-related inflammation and chronic neurodegenerative diseases
In our study, we found that astrocytic YAP was downregulated in aged mice and AD model mice in a Hippo kinases dependent manner, and deletion of YAP or activation of YAP in astrocytes promotes or delays the aging of the brain, respectively, indicating that senescent astrocytes by YAP downregulation may contribute to aging of the brain and AD.
Several previous studies have revealed that YAP-CDK6 pathway inhibits cellular senescence (Q.
Consistent with previous studies, in our studies, several lines of evidences suggest that YAP-CDK6 signaling mediates D-gal-induced senescence of astrocytes.
Firstly, YAP was
In future, how YAP-CDK6 signaling prevents astrocytic senescence requires further study.
persons, such as the senolytic therapy (combined use of dasatinib and quercetin) (M.
In our study, we found that activation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 partially improved the cognitive function of AD model mice and old mice, and inhibition of CDK6 promoted astrocytic senescence.
These evidences indicated that activation of the YAP-CDK6 pathway may delay brain aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases.
However, a number of studies have demonstrated that YAP and CDK6 promote tumorigenesis
It is possible that the YAP-CDK6 pathway may promote tumor progression under excessive activation, and may rejuvenate senescent astrocytes with moderate activation, thereby playing dual roles under cancer or cellular senescence conditions, depending on the activation degree of this pathway, although this remains to be studied further.
Therefore, in future, to delay brain aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, appropriate activation of YAP should be considered carefully, and further investigations are required.
In summary, our studies identified unrecognized functions of YAP in preventing astrocytic senescence in vitro and in vivo, revealed the YAP-CDK6 pathway in the negative control of astrocytic senescence, and discovered the new function of XMU-MP-1 in antiaging, which may provide new insights and targets for delaying brain aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases.

, again, both YAP and Lamin B1 expression were decreased, however, p-YAP levels and the p-YAP/YAP ratios were increased in the hippocampus tissues of AD model mice.
The phosphorylation levels of the Hippo kinases such as LATS1, MST1, MOB1 and YAP were elevated significantly in the AD model mice, compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice (Figure S1j-p), implying that the downregulation and inactivation of YAP in AD model mice was | 3 of 16 XU et al. dependent on the Hippo pathway.
Moreover, immunohistochemical staining also showed that YAP expression was suppressed in the hippocampal astrocytes of AD model mice (Figure 1k,l).
Taken together, these results indicate that YAP is downregulated and inactivated in the hippocampal astrocytes of aged mice and AD model mice, which may contribute to brain aging.

Moreover, in the hippocampus of old YAP GFAP -CKO mice, the expression of Lamin B1 was significantly decreased in NeuN (a marker of neurons) positive cells (FigureS6a-b), but was comparable in Iba1 (a marker | 5 of 16 XU et al.


), and the percentage of β-galactosidase positive astrocytes in these D-gal and XMU-MP-1-treated astrocytes was elevated significantly after CP-10 treatment(Figure 5i,j).
Taken together, these results suggest that activation of YAP-CDK6 signaling by suppressing Hippo kinases prevents the senescence of astrocytes in vitro.
Subsequently, we tested whether activation of YAP restores the senescence of astrocytes in vivo, and thereby improving the cognitive function of aged mice and AD model mice.
As expected, in the hippocampus of old mice and AD model mice, western blot showed that YAP, CDK6 and Lamin B1 expression were significantly upregulated, and p-YAP/YAP level was downregulated by application of XMU-MP-1 (Figure 6a-d).
Double immunostaining showed that the expression of Lamin B1 was significantly increased in astrocytes in old mice and AD model mice by XMU-MP-1 treatment (Figure 6e-h).
These results suggest that activation of YAP by suppressing the Hippo pathway delays the senescence of astrocytes in vivo.
We next examined whether delay of the senescence of astrocytes improves the cognitive function of aged mice and AD model mice.
Indeed, Y-maze test showed that the percentage number of alternations was significantly increased by XMU-MP-1 treatment in AD model mice and old mice, but not in the WT mice or young mice (Figure 6i-j), which suggest that activation of YAP in astrocytes improves the function of learning and memory in AD model mice and old mice.
Barnes maze test was further performed in AD model mice showed that the time spent to reach the target exit was reduced by XMU-MP-1 treatment, and the target/non-target ratio was increased (Figure 6k-m), indicating that the cognitive function was improved in AD model mice by XMU-MP-1 treatment.
Taken together, these results suggest that activation of YAP-CDK6 signaling by XMU-MP-1 delays the senescence of astrocytes in vitro and in vivo, and thereby improving the cognitive function of aged mice and AD model mice.

Secondly, YAP deletion in astrocytes significantly reduced CDK6 expression, aggravated cell senescence, and impaired cognitive function.
Thirdly, overexpression of CDK6 partially rescued the senescence of astrocytes, and inhibition of CDK6 abolished XMU-MP-1's preventive effects on senescence of astrocytes.

slight modifications.
Briefly, mice were habituated in the testing room overnight before the spontaneous alternation test by using an opaque perspex Y-maze (40 cm long and 9 cm wide with 21 cm high walls).
Each animal was placed in turn in arm A of the Y-maze and allowed to explore for 8 min, and the arm entries and walking distance were recorded.
All equipment was cleaned between each trial with 75% ethanol.
Spontaneous alternation was defined as a successive entry into three different arms, on overlapping triplet sets.
The maximum number of alternations was defined as the total number of arm entries minus 2. The percentage number of alternations (alternation %) = the number of actual alternations/the maximum number of alternations ×100%, which was an indication of cognitive function.
All behavioral observations were made between 15:00 and 18:00 pm.

A black Plexiglas escape box (15 × 7 × 7 cm) containing paper cage bedding on its floor was located under one of the holes (defined as the target hole) in a room with a light intensity of 1200 lux.
The location of the target was consistent for a given mouse.
Firstly, adaptation was accomplished by each mouse.
For each mouse, it was guided into the hole twice within 3 min, at an experiment interval of 15 min.
Training lasted for 4 successive days (day 1-4) were performed, each mouse for 2 trials, with a 15 min interval.
To start a trial, a test mouse was placed in the center of the maze, held there for 10 s by using a dark box, and then the mouse was allowed to explore freely.
Once the mouse entered the escape box, it was remained undisturbed for 1 min with the light off.
Mice that failed to find the target hole were gently guided to the escape box.
On the fifth day (day 5), a probe trial was conducted.
The escape box was changed to another hole and the maze was rotated to keep the spatial position of the target hole unchanged, in order to avoid odor guidance.
All equipment was cleaned between each trial with 75% ethanol.
Time latency to reach the target hole and the search errors were recorded.
