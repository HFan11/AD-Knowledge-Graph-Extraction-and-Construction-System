The Alzheimer susceptibility gene BIN1 induces isoform-dependent neurotoxicity through early endosome defects
The Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) gene is a major susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Deciphering its pathophysiological role is challenging due to its numerous isoforms.
Here we observed in Drosophila that human BIN1 isoform1 (BIN1iso1) overexpression, contrary to human BIN1 isoform8 (BIN1iso8) and human BIN1 isoform9 (BIN1iso9), induced an accumulation of endosomal vesicles and neurodegeneration.
Systematic search for endosome regulators able to prevent BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration indicated that a defect at the early endosome level is responsible for the neurodegeneration.
In human induced neurons (hiNs) and cerebral organoids, BIN1 knock-out resulted in the narrowing of early endosomes.
This phenotype was rescued by BIN1iso1 but not BIN1iso9 expression.
Finally, BIN1iso1 overexpression also led to an increase in the size of early endosomes and neurodegeneration in hiNs.
Altogether, our data demonstrate that the AD susceptibility gene BIN1, and especially BIN1iso1, contributes to earlyendosome size deregulation, which is an early pathophysiological hallmark of AD pathology.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by two main cerebral lesions: the extracellular aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) into senile plaques and the intracellular aggregation of phosphorylated Tau into tangles.
In addition, other cytopathological features specific to familial and sporadic AD can be also observed such as abnormally enlarged early endosomes in neurons
At the genetic level, familial AD is due to mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2.
Sporadic AD is a multifactorial disease exhibiting a strong genetic component with an estimated attributable risk of 60-80%
Over the last decade, our understanding of this genetic component has strongly progressed with the identification of 76 loci associated with the disease
Among these loci, BIN1 is the second AD susceptibility gene after APOE in terms of association
BIN1 encodes at least 20 exons subject to extensive differential splicing, generating multiple isoforms with different tissue distributions
BIN1 isoform1 (BIN1iso1) and BIN1 isoform8 (BIN1iso8) are respectively expressed in the brain and skeletal muscles, the two tissues where BIN1 is mostly expressed, whereas BIN1 isoform9 (BIN1iso9) is ubiquitously expressed (GTEx portal,
gtexp ortal.
org).
In the brain, BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9 are the most abundant isoforms
All BIN1 isoforms possess the N terminal BIN1/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, involved in membrane curvature sensing and induction, the C-terminal MYC-Binding Domain (MBD) and the C-terminal SH3 domain, a protein-protein interaction domain that recognizes proline-rich domains like the one in Tau
Muscle-specific isoforms contain a phosphoinositide-interacting (PI) domain, whereas brain-specific BIN1 isoforms are mainly characterized by inclusion of exons encoding a Clathrin and Adaptor Protein-2 binding (CLAP) domain involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking.
In the brain, a complex expression pattern is also observed at the cellular level.
BIN1 expression is mainly observed in oligodendrocytes, microglial cells and neurons
However, while neurons express high molecular weight isoforms including BIN1iso1, glial cells express lower molecular weight isoforms such as BIN1iso9
AD-associated BIN1 variants are non-coding and likely regulate BIN1 expression
However, the dysregulation of BIN1 expression in the brain of AD cases is still highly debated.
Some results indicate that overall BIN1 expression is increased
In addition, according to the pattern of expression, it is not clear if the observed variations of BIN1 expression are a cause or a consequence of the neurodegenerative process.
For example, the decrease in BIN1iso1 and increase in BIN1iso9 expressions may be a consequence of neuronal death and gliosis, respectively, as BIN1 isoform variations are correlated with neuronal and glial marker variations
Therefore, based on its global and/or isoform expression variation, it is difficult to assess whether BIN1 may be deleterious or protective in AD.
Importantly, impact of such global and/or isoform expression deregulations on the AD pathophysiological process has not yet been elucidated even if several hypotheses have been proposed: (i) modulation of Tau function and neurotoxicity though interaction of the BIN1 SH3 domain with the Tau proline-rich domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner
Within this complex background, considering the numerous BIN1 isoforms and the different functions regulated by this gene, it is, thus, pivotal to address isoformspecific functions of BIN1 towards a comprehensive understanding of its role in AD pathophysiology.
For this purpose, we investigated the role and potential toxicity of BIN1 isoforms in neuronal cells by focusing on BIN1iso1, BIN1iso8 and BIN1iso9.
We used the highly tractable and readout-rich Drosophila model which allowed the assessment of BIN1 isoform neurotoxicity in vivo during aging.
We further analyzed the role of BIN1 isoforms in hiNs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), a model closer to AD pathology.

The wall of the cylinder had 5 main graduations, the top one being 13 cm from the bottom.
Flies were tapped down to the bottom of the cylinder and recorded for 10 s to see if they climbed up the wall of the cylinder.
This was repeated 5 times in total.
A score corresponding to the distance they had climbed was determined by the recorded movies.
Flies got a score of between 0 and 5 depending on the main graduation that they were able to reach during the 10 s period.
The mean of the 5 trials was calculated and attributed to each fly.

Western blot of Drosophila samples
Drosophila heads (n = 10) and thorax (n = 5) were dissected and crushed in ice-cold LDS lysis buffer (NP0008, NuPAGE, Novex, Life Technologies) supplemented with reducing agent (NP0009, NuPAGE, Novex, Life Technologies).
Samples were centrifuged at 8500g for 10 min at 4 °C.
Supernatants were kept at -80 °C.
Once thawed, they were boiled for 10 min at 85 °C before being loaded and separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels 4-12% (NuPAGE Bis-Tris, ThermoScientific) in MOPS 1X buffer (NP0001-02, NuPAGE, Novex, Life Technologies).
After migration, samples were transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes using the Biorad Trans-blot transfert system kit (Biorad) according to the supplier technical recommendation (7 min, 2.5 A, 25 V).
Next, membranes were incubated in milk (5% in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20) to block non-specific binding sites during 1 h at RT, followed by several washes.
Immunoblotting was carried out with primary antibodies anti-BIN1 (BIN1 99D, 05-449, Millipore, RRID:AB_309738, 1/2500; BIN1 ab27796, abcam, RRID:AB_725699, 1/1000), anti-α-tubuline (α-tubuline DM1A, T9026, Sigma, RRID:AB_477593, 1/5000), anti-dAmph (#9906, kind gift of Andrew Zelhof, 1/5000)

Optical densities of bands were quantified using Fiji software and results were normalized with respect to tubulin expression

Cornea neutralization
CO2-anesthetized flies were placed in a 35 mm cell culture dish half-filled with 1% agarose and covered with water at 4 °C as described
Flies were observed using an upright confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM710, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 40 × water immersion long-distance objective.
Images were acquired using the Zen acquisition software (Zeiss Zen software).
Photoreceptor neurons were manually quantified.

Immunofluorescence of Drosophila samples
Fly heads were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature.
After washing, retinas were finely dissected, permeabilized and depigmented in 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (0.3% PBT) overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation.
After blocking with 5% normal goat/donkey serum in 0.3% PBT, samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies diluted in 0.3% PBT.
The following antibodies were used: anti-NA/K ATPase alpha subunit (a5, DSHB, RRID:AB_2166869, 1/100), antirhodopsin (4C5, DSHB, RRID:AB_528451, 1/200) and anti-GFP (132004, Synaptic System, RRID:AB_11041999, 1/100).
After washing, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Alexa 555 Phalloidin anti-F-actin (A34055, ThermoFisher Scientific) and the secondary antibodies diluted in 0.3% PBT: Alexa 488 Donkey anti-guinea pig (706-545-148, RRID:AB_2340472, Jackson Immu-noResearch), Alexa 633 Goat anti-mouse (A-21052, RRID:AB_2535719, ThermoFisher Scientific).
After washing, samples were incubated in 90% glycerol PBS for 30 min in the dark before being mounted in the same solution.
Retinas were imaged with a LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 40X oil objective.

Electron microscopy
Drosophila eyes were dissected and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8) 30 min at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C.
After washing, eyes were postfixed at room temperature in 1% OsO4 and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide for 1 h, then with 1% uranyl acetate for 45 min, both in distilled water at room temperature in the dark.
After washing, they were dehydrated with successive ethanol solutions.
Eyes were infiltrated with epoxy resin (EMbed 812 from EMS) and were mounted in resin into silicone embedding molds.
Polymerization was performed at 60 °C for 2 days.
Ultrathin sections of 70-80 nm thickness were observed on formvar-coated grid with a Hitachi H7500 TEM (Milexia, France), and images were acquired with a 1 Mpixel digital camera from AMT (Milexia, France).

Maintenance of cells and generation of hiPSCs and neural derivatives
hiPSCs (ASE 9109, Applied StemCell Inc. CA, USA) modified for BIN1 in exon 3 (Fig.
Homozygous null mutants for BIN1 had a 5 bp deletion on one allele and an 8 bp deletion on the other allele.
All hiPSCs, and all subsequent human induced neural progenitor cells (hiNPCs), hiNs, human induced astrocytes (hiAs), and cerebral organoids derived thereof, were maintained in media from Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada.
Maintenance of cell cultures and organoids were done in adherence with manufacturer's protocols which can be found on the webpage of Stemcell Technologies.
hiPSCs were maintained in mTeSR1 medium in non-treated cell culture dishes/plates pre-coated with vitronectin.
Cell numbers and viability were recorded using a LUNA ™ Automated Cell Counter.
In order to obtain hiNPCs, the embryoid body method detailed by Stemcell Technologies was used for the induction of BIN1 WT and KO hiPSCs.
Following the generation of hiNPCs, these derived cells were maintained in treated cell culture dishes pre-coated with poly-L-ornithine (PLO) and laminin (5 µg/mL).
PLO solution was made in water (0.001%) while laminin was diluted in PBS with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ .
BIN1 WT and KO hiNPCs, thus generated, were maintained for up to 10 passages.
2D cultures comprising hiNs and hiAs were produced from hiNPCs.
60,000 hiNPCs/well were plated in 24-well cell imaging plates from Eppendorf (Cat # 0030741005) pre-coated with PLO (0.001%) and laminin (10 µg/mL).
Cells were kept in 0.5 mL of NPC medium per well for 24 h.
Following this, equal volume of complete BrainPhys medium (supplemented with BDNF, GDNF, laminin, dibutyryl-cAMP, ascorbic acid, N2, and SM1) was added to each well to begin the process of differentiation.
Subsequently, media was changed in the plates bi-weekly.
The media change consisted of removing half of the existing medium in each well and replacing it with an equal volume of fresh complete BrainPhys medium.
Mixed cultures of hiNs and hiAs were obtained at the end of 6 weeks from the start of the differentiation process.

Generation of cerebral organoids
Cerebral Organoids were generated from hiPSCs at 80% confluency.
hiPSCs were detached from the Vitronectin XF substrate using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (Stemcell Technologies), centrifuged, pelleted and resuspended in Embryoid Body (EB) seeding medium (Stemcell Technologies) to form EBs. 9000 cells were plated per well in a 96-well round-bottom ultra-low attachment plate.
After two days, 1 or 2 EBs were transferred to a well of a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate containing Induction Medium (Stemcell Technologies).
The EBs were kept in the induction Medium for 2 days and next they were transferred into Matrigel (Corning) using an embedding surface.
When the Matrigel polymerized, the EB were transferred to a 6-well ultra-low adherent plate with Expansion Medium (Stemcell Technologies).
After 3 days, the medium was replaced by Maturation Medium (Stemcell Technologies) and the plate was placed in an orbital shaker (65 rpm speed).
Complete media changes were done on a bi-weekly basis.

Lentiviral infections
Lentiviral constructs were produced by the Vect'UB platform within the TBM Core unit at University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France (CNRS UMS 3427, INSERM US 005).
All three lentiviral constructs harbored reporter tags for the expression of tdTomato protein.
The lentiviral vectors used were the empty vector-436 (ID # 1770), 436-Bin1Iso1 (ID # 1771), and 436-Bin1Iso9 (ID # 1772).
Lentiviral infections were done in 3-week old differentiation cultures obtained from hiNPCs.
Viral transductions were performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.
In brief, appropriate volumes of each construct were mixed in complete BrainPhys medium and 50 ul of the viral medium mix was then added to each well.
Each of the 3 constructs were added in triplicate to respective wells for each of the BIN1 WT and KO cells.
Infected cells were maintained for a further 3-week period with bi-weekly changes of half volume of medium in each well.

Immunocytochemistry of 2D cultures
Cells were fixed in PFA (4% w/v) for 10 min.
Fixed cells were then washed with PBS 0.1 M. Cells were then blocked with blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS 0.1 M) at room temperature for 1 h under shaking conditions.
Primary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution were then added and incubation was done overnight at 4ºC under shaking conditions.
The following day, cells were washed with PBS 0.1 M 3 times for 10 min each before the addition of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature under shaking conditions ensuring protection from light. 3 washes with PBS were done for 10 min each at room temperature under shaking conditions with protection from light.
Hoechst 33258 nucleic acid stain was added to PBS 0.1 M in the second wash.
Cells were mounted with fluoromount and imaged directly in the cell imaging plates.
All images were acquired using an LSM 880 Confocal Scanning Microscope housed at the Imaging Platform of the Institut Pasteur de Lille using the ZEISS ZEN Imaging Software.
Image acquisition was done at 40X for the various cellular markers in Fig.
For EEA1 quantifications, we selected 10 random regions positive for MAP2 in 2-3 different wells from 3 independent cell culture batches.
Images were taken using a 63X objective and zoom of 2.

Immunohistochemistry of organoid samples
Cerebral organoids were fixed in PFA (4% w/v) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by three washes with PBS 0.1 M. Cerebral organoids were then placed in sucrose solution (30% w/v) overnight before being embedded in O.C.T (Tissue-Tek).
Embedded tissue was sectioned at 20 μm using a cryostat and mounted slides were stored at -80 °C until immunostaining was performed.
Mounted tissue was removed from storage and warmed by placing at room temperature for 30 min.
Tissue were rehydrated and washed with room temperature PBS 0.1 M 3 times for 5 min.
Slides were then washed once with PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min.
Tissue was blocked using 10% of donkey serum in PBS 0.1 M for 1 h at room temperature.
After blocking, primary antibodies were added to 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% of donkey serum in PBS 0.1 M at appropriate dilutions and incubated overnight at 4 °C.
The next day, slides were washed with PBS 0.1 M 3 times for 5 min each with gentle shaking.
Subsequently, slides were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% of donkey serum in PBS 0.1 M for 2 h at room temperature in the dark.
After secondary antibody incubation, slides were washed 3 times with PBS for 5 min with gentle shanking.
Nuclei were visualized by incubating the tissue for 5 min with Hoechst stain in PBS 0.1 M. Sections were mounted using aqueous mounting medium (Polysciences).
Images were acquired using an LSM 880 Confocal Scanning Microscope in concert with the ZEISS ZEN imaging software housed at the Imaging Platform of the Pasteur Institute, Lille.
For EEA1 quantifications, we selected 5 random regions in the surface (50-250 µm) of each cerebral organoid, where a high density of MAP2-positive cells could be distinguished.
Images were acquired using a 63X objective in 2-3 different sections obtained from at least 3 cerebral organoids of each genotype.

Antibodies used for immunocytochemistry/ immunohistochemistry of hiNs and organoid samples
hiPSCs were detected with antibodies for SOX2 (RRID:AB_2651000) and SSEA4 (RRID:AB_2651001) using the Molecular Probes ™ Pluripotent Stem Cell 4-Marker Immunocytochemistry Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, RRID:AB_2651000).

All fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies were sourced from Jacskon ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd.

Immunoblotting of 2D cultures and cerebral organoid
Samples from the 2D cultures or brain organoids were collected in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) and sonicated two times at 60-70% during 10 s before use for the western blotting analyses.
Protein quantification was performed using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific).
In total, 10 μg of protein from extracts were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels 4-12% (NuPAGE Bis-Tris, Thermo Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).
Next, membranes were incubated in milk (5% in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 -TTBS, or SuperBlock -Thermo Scientific) to block non-specific binding sites during 1 h at RT, followed by several washes with TTBS.
Immunoblottings were carried out with primary antibodies anti-BIN1 (ab182562, Abcam, RRID:AB_725699), anti-APP (C-terminal) (A8717, Sigma-Aldrich, RRID:AB_258409) and anti-β-ACTIN (A1978, Sigma-Aldrich, RRID:AB_476692) overnight at 4 °C on 20 RPM agitation.

The membranes were washed three times in TTBS, and the immunoreactivity was revealed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal, Thermo Scientific) and imaged using the Amersham Imager 600 (GE Life Sciences).
Optical densities of bands were quantified using the Gel Analyzer plugin in Fiji -ImageJ

Image analysis using Imaris
The "surface" function on Imaris was used for detection of EEA1 puncta.
Background subtraction was performed using "local contrast" and automatic threshold, warranting the same processing criteria for all images.
Next, a manual filter cut-off was applied to detect all puncta volumes above 0.1 µm 3 .
MAP2 and tdTomato surfaces were also detected based on background subtraction using "local contrast" and automatic threshold.
Automatic thresholds using the filter "absolute intensity" were then applied to find MAP2 and tdTomato surfaces.
For the detection of EEA1 puncta on MAP2 and EEA1 puncta on MAP2 + /tdTomato + cells, filters for the standard deviation of intensity were applied in the MAP2 and tdTomato channels respectively.
Volume information for the EEA1 puncta were collated from each acquired image as CSV files.
The volumes were sorted using Microsoft Excel.
We used a cut-off maximum volume of 10µm 3 for each field.
The sorted volume data were then analyzed statistically using the GraphPad Prism software.

snRNA-seq library preparation
Nuclei isolation and Hash-tagging with oligonucleotides steps were realized on ice with pre-cold buffers and centrifugations at 4 °C.
BIN1 WT and KO organoids of 6 months (n=4 per genotype) were cut in 2 parts, washed twice with 1 ml of Deionized Phosphate Buffer Saline 1X (DPBS, GIBCO ™ , Fisher Scientific 11590476) and centrifuged 5 min at 300g.

Results

Functional conservation of human BIN1 isoforms in Drosophila
BIN1 belongs to the amphiphysin family and in mammals, two genes compose this family: amphiphysin I (AMPH) and amphiphysin II (AMPH2) also named BIN1.
Drosophila has only one ortholog called Amphiphysin (Amph) that is referred to as dAmph henceforth in this article.
dAmph has 3 isoforms but only the BAR and SH3 domains are conserved in dAmph.
Within this background, we generated 3 transgenic Drosophila lines expressing the human BIN1iso1, BIN1iso8 and BIN1iso9 isoforms.
As a control, we also generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing the longest dAmph isoform, dAmphA (Fig.
We obtained transgenic lines expressing identical basal level of BIN1 isoforms with two additional BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9 lines expressing high BIN1 levels that we used for dose-dependent effects (Additional file 1 and Additional file 2: Fig.
We assessed the functional conservation of human BIN1 isoforms in Drosophila.
Like human subjects harboring BIN1 coding mutations and suffering myopathy
We tested if the expression of muscle human BIN1iso8 could restore the locomotor performance of dAmph deficient adult transgenic flies assessed in the so-called climbing test.
In addition to the null dAmph 5E3 allele, we took advantage of a dAmph MI08903-TG4.0
allele that allows Gal4 expression under the control of dAmph endogenous promoter while stopping dAmph transcription (Additional file 1 and Additional file 3: Fig.
We checked by western blot that dAmph expression was abolished in dAmph MI08903-TG4.0/5E3
compound heterozygous flies compared to dAmph MI08903-TG4.0/+
heterozygous flies and that BIN1iso8 could be expressed in this genetic background (Fig.
Then, we observed that dAmph MI08903-TG4.0/5E3
compound heterozygous flies had locomotor defects like dAmph 5E3/5E3 null flies compared to control flies or dAmph MI08903-TG4.0/+
heterozygous flies (Fig.
Expression of human BIN1iso8 restored the locomotor abilities of dAmph MI08903-TG4.0/5E3
compound heterozygous flies to levels similar to the ones observed in control flies or dAmph MI08903-TG4.0/+
heterozygous flies (Fig.
Thus, human BIN1iso8 is able to rescue the locomotor functions of dAmph null flies, thereby indicating a functional conservation of human BIN1iso8 in Drosophila.
Next, we addressed the possible functional conservation of BIN1 isoforms in neuronal cells.

These neurons possess a specialized compartment, called rhabdomere, which consists of an apical microvillar stack of actin-rich intricately folded membranes containing the light-sensing rhodopsin proteins.
We tested if human BIN1 isoforms expression with the early eye-specific GMR driver could phenocopy the dAmphAinduced rhabdomere phenotype.
The Drosophila eye is composed of 600-800 units called ommatidia.
Each ommatidium contains 6 outer photoreceptor neurons and 2 superimposed inner photoreceptor neurons.
We expressed GFP in the outer photoreceptor neurons (Rh1 driver) and used the cornea neutralization technique to assess rhabdomere morphology
While we observed six rhabdomeres per ommatidium, of similar size and organized in a trapezoidal shape in the control condition, some rhabdomeres were missing and others were smaller or deformed in the dAmphA overexpressing condition (Fig.
Thus, we confirmed that expression of dAmphA alters rhabdomere morphogenesis.
Individual expression of BIN1iso1, BIN1iso8 or BIN1iso9 recapitulated a similar phenotype respectively (Fig.
In addition, high levels of BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9 exacerbated the phenotype indicating a dose-dependent effect.
We also confirmed these results on whole-mount pupal retina dissection (Fig.
dAmphA-, BIN1iso1-, BIN1iso8-and BIN1iso9overexpressing retina exhibited strong deformed accumulations of F-actin at the level of the rhabdomere.
In conclusion, overexpression of all human BIN1 isoforms phenocopied dAmphA overexpression during the development of photoreceptor neurons suggesting functional conservation also at the neuronal level.

Human BIN1iso1 is neurotoxic in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons
The neurotoxic effects of human BIN1 isoforms in the developing Drosophila prompted us to investigate whether a similar effect could also be observed after expression of BIN1 isoforms in adult Drosophila.
To do so, we employed the outer photoreceptor-specific driver Rh1, active in photoreceptor neurons after rhabdomere morphogenesis at the end of pupal development.
We quantified the number of outer photoreceptor neurons following cornea neutralization and rhabdomere Fig.

While each ommatidium contained 6 outer photorceptors organized in a trapezoid shape (yellow circles) in the two control conditions, BIN1 isoforms and dAmphA expression resulted in a strong alteration in the number, shape and trapezoid organization of the rhabdomeres with a stronger effect for BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9 high-expressing lines.

visualization.
We observed that young flies (1 day-old) had a normal number of outer photoreceptor neurons (6 per ommatidium) with normal morphology (Fig.
These observations indicated that the use of rh1 driver bypasses the developmental retinal defects observed using the GMR driver.
We then observed that 4-weekold flies expressing BIN1iso1, but not the ones expressing BIN1iso8, BIN1iso9 and dAmphA, lost around half of their outer photoreceptor neurons (Fig.
This phenotype was not dose-dependent as flies expressing basal or high BIN1iso1 levels had a similar outer photoreceptor neuron loss.
Of note, flies expressing high levels of BIN1iso9 had nearly no loss of outer photoreceptor neurons (Fig.
In conclusion, expression of BIN1iso1 induced a progressive neurodegeneration in adult Drosophila photoreceptor neurons and this effect was isoform-specific and not dose-dependent.
Since photoreceptor neurons are specialized neurons highly dependent on the phototransduction cascade
For this purpose, we assessed whether the degeneration was light-dependent.
BIN1iso1-expressing flies were allowed to age in the normal 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle or under constant dark condition for 4 weeks.
Light absence did not prevent outer photoreceptor neurodegeneration even if occurring to a lesser extent (Fig.
This indicated that the phototransduction cascade was not the main cause of the neurodegeneration and that increased global neuronal activity favors BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration.
We asked why BIN1iso1 was more toxic for photoreceptor neurons than the other BIN1 isoforms.
We wondered whether it could originate from the subcellular localization of BIN1 isoforms.
We labelled retinas of 1-day old flies expressing either BIN1iso1, BIN1iso8 or BIN1iso9 for BIN1 (Fig.
All BIN1 isoforms were similarly enriched at the base of photoreceptor neuron rhabdomeres.
We next wondered what in the sequence of BIN1iso1 makes it neurotoxic.
BIN1iso1 differs from BIN1iso9 by two sequences: (i) the Exon7 in the BAR domain and (ii) the neuronal specific CLAP domain.
We tested the neurotoxicity of truncated BIN1iso1 forms for these two sequences (Fig.
Hence, the BIN1iso1-induced degeneration depends on its CLAP domain and to a lesser extent on the Exon7 in the BAR domain.
Since the CLAP domain is known to interact with AP-1 adaptin, AP-2 adaptin and the Clathrin Heavy Chain, which are involved in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking

BIN1iso1 induces vesicle accumulation in photoreceptor neurons
To further understand the cause of the BIN1iso1-induced degeneration, we analyzed the degenerating photoreceptor neurons by electron microscopy.
While neurons in 15-day-old flies either expressing luciferase, BIN1iso9 or dAmphA did not show any abnormalities, the degenerating neurons in BIN1iso1 flies exhibited a strong accumulation of vesicles (Fig.
These vesicles were of various sizes, some of them nearly as big as a complete ommatidium.
The cytoplasm of some photoreceptor neurons was filled with vesicles, compacting it against the plasma membrane, which seemed intact.
The vesicles were surrounded by a single membrane and not a double membrane as observed in autophagosome (Fig.
Rhabdomeres of BIN1iso1 photoreceptor neurons were disintegrated, whereas the chromatin seemed normal although the nucleus was frequently squeezed in between vesicles (Fig.
Eventually, photoreceptor neurons died (Additional file 5: Fig.
Hence, ultrastructural analysis of degenerating photoreceptor neurons indicated that the neurodegeneration induced by BIN1iso1 is characterized by a strong accumulation of single membrane vesicles of unknown origin.
We next evaluated the nature of these vesicles by immunofluorescence using specific organelle GFP-or YFP-tagged markers for endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, plasma membrane, early endosome, late endosome/ multivesicular body, recycling endosome, lysosome and autophagosome
In 15-day-old flies, many BIN1iso1-induced vesicles were positive for EYFP:Rab5 and GFP:2xFYVE, markers of early endosome and for EYFP:Rab7 and evi:GFP, markers of late endosome/multivesicular body (Fig.
These different markers labelled small-to middle-sized vesicles with the exception of evi:GFP which tended to label bigger vesicles.
Some big vesicles were  One photoreceptor neuron is outlined per image, its cytoplasm and nucleus being highlighted in yellow and its rhabdomere in green.
Each ommatidium contains 6 outer photoreceptor neurons whose rhabdomeres are organized in a trapezoidal shape, with a 7th rhabdomere in the middle corresponding to one of the two inner photoreceptor neurons.
In the BIN1iso1 condition, only 4 rhabdomeres can be seen.
In addition, the cytoplasm of the photoreceptor is filled with vesicles, some of them (highlighted in magenta) are very big.
These vesicles are surrounded by a single membrane (arrow on the right panel) as compared to the nuclear envelope (double arrow).
Their rhabdomere is usually disintegrating (*).

Rh1 and actin staining, respectively yellow and magenta in the merge image, are used to label retina structure of 15-day-old flies.
The photoreceptor neurons expressed Luciferase as a control or BIN1iso1.
In the BIN1iso1 conditions, many vesicles were positive for the tested organelle markers (arrows, green staining in merge images).
The extracellular inter-rhabdomeric staining for the evi:GFP marker (arrowhead) corresponds to exosomes.
e Images of photoreceptor neurons expressing BIN1iso1 stained for BIN1, the photoreceptor neuron plasma membrane Na/K ATPase and actin in 7-day-old flies.
BIN1iso1 is localized at the base of the rhabdomeres and around some abnormal vesicles as seen in the inset also exceptionally labelled by the lysosomal Lamp2:GFP marker and corresponded to rare multilamellar bodies observed by electron microscopy (Additional file 5: Fig.
Of note, we also noticed that the extracellular space between rhabdomeres of the 8 photoreceptor neurons in the middle of ommatidia, called the interrhabdomeric space, was positive for evi:GFP in both the control and BIN1iso1 conditions (arrowhead Fig.
Since evi:GFP labels exosomes either within the multivesicular bodies or in the extracellular environment
In addition, we observed staining for BIN1 around some vesicles suggesting a potential direct action of BIN1iso1 on the membrane dynamics of these vesicles (Fig.
In conclusion, these results suggested that BIN1iso1induced vesicles accumulation originated from a blockade at the level of early endosome and/or late endosome.

BIN1iso1 induces neurodegeneration through blockade of the early endosome trafficking in drosophila photoreceptor neurons
To test if the intracellular trafficking defects were responsible for the neurodegeneration phenotype, we tested if regulators of endosome trafficking could rescue BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration.
We tested regulator of early endosome (Rab5), recycling endosome (Rab11), late endosome (Rab7 and Rab9) and lysosome (subunits of the V-ATPase) (mostly a collection of UAS transgenes expressing wild-type, constitutively active and dominant negative Rab proteins
We observed an inhibition of BIN1iso1-induced neurotoxicity through a rescue of photoreceptor neurons for regulators of the early endosome Rab5 and recycling endosome Rab11 (Fig.
Modulation of the late endosome regulators Rab7 and Rab9, and of lysosome V-ATPase did not modify BIN1iso1-induced neuronal loss (Fig.
Of note, we checked by western blot that the rescue effect of Rab5 and Rab11 was not due to a decrease in BIN1iso1 expression, consecutive to a dilution of the Gal4 between the multiple UAS constructs (Fig.
We further tested the constitutively active (CA) and dominant negative (DN) forms of Rab5 and Rab11, respectively named Rab5 CA , Rab5 DN , Rab11 CA and Rab11 DN .
Surprisingly Rab5 DN rescued BIN1iso1-expressing photoreceptor neurons, whereas Rab5 CA had no effect (Fig.
This indicated that, although counterintuitive, overexpression of wild-type Rab5 resulted in a loss of function of Rab5 and that loss of function of Rab5 is protective against BIN1iso1neurodegeneration. We confirmed this result when one copy of Rab5 (Rab5 2/+ ) was removed or by knocking down Rab5 (Rab5 HMS00145 ) (Fig.
Contrary to Rab5, Rab11 DN increased BIN1iso1-induced neuronal loss (although not significant) (Fig.
A gain of function of Rab11 seemed, therefore, protective against BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration.
We also tested the fast recycling endosome regulator Rab4 (Additional file 7: Fig.
Although one construct expressing mRFP-tagged Rab4 rescued BIN1-induced neurodegeneration, another YFP-tagged Rab4 construct did not, and neither did the YFP-tagged Rab4 DN or Rab4 CA construct.
Altogether, because the neurodegeneration was rescued by modulation of regulators of early and recycling endosomes, these results indicated that BIN1iso1induced photoreceptor neuron degeneration is due to a defect in the early endosome trafficking.
We further wondered if BIN1iso1 neurotoxicity may be mediated by APP or one of its metabolites.
Indeed, APP-β Carboxy Terminal Fragment (APP-βCTF), the product of APP cleavage by β-secretase and precursor of Aβ peptide through γ-secretase cleavage, induces endosome enlargement in neurons
Drosophila has a single homolog of APP, called APP Like (Appl), which is also processed by several secretases and generates secreted fragments, a neurotoxic Aβ-like peptide and an C-terminal intracellular domain (AICD)
Interestingly, Appl regulates endolysosomal function in Drosophila neurons
In addition, some results support a regulation of APP processing by BIN1
We tested if loss of function, overexpression of Appl or overexpression of human APP could modulate BIN1iso1-induced photoreceptor neuron degeneration.
Loss of one copy of Appl had no (See figure on next page.)

Statistical analysis was performed using a Kruskal Wallis test (p = 0.003643 for Rab5, p = 6.169 × 10 -06 for Rab5 DN and Rab5 CA , p = 0.0001721 for Rab5 mutant and knockdown, p = 0.003643 for Rab11, p = 0.03487 for Rab11 DN and Rab11 CA , p = 0.1408 for Rab7, p = 0.24 for Rab7 DN and Rab7 CA , p = 0.8959 for Rab9, p = 0.1394 for lysosomal ATPase subunit knockdown, p = 0.006947 for Appl/APP) followed by Mann Whitney comparison (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) effect suggesting that Appl is not required for BIN1iso1 toxicity (Fig.
Overexpression of Appl and human APP significantly enhanced PR loss but only slightly in terms of fold change and not significantly compared to the loss of one copy of Appl (Fig.
Overall, these experiments suggest that APP (and potentially its metabolites) do not contribute to the BIN1iso1 neurotoxicity observed in our Drosophila model.

Generation and characterization of BIN1 WT and KO human induced neurons
Next, we wondered whether the role of BIN1iso1 in endosome trafficking was conserved in Human.
To address this possibility, we generated human isogenic BIN1 wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines by CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
Both hiPSC lines showed similar expression of pluripotency cell markers (SOX2 and SSEA4, Fig.
BIN1 WT hiPSC expressed low molecular weight BIN1 isoforms, including likely BIN1iso9 (Fig.
We then employed these cells to generate hiPSC-derived neurons both in bi-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and in cerebral organoids.
Following neural induction, both BIN1 WT and KO human induced neural progenitor cells (hiNPCs) expressed similar levels of NESTIN and SOX2 (Fig.
Although BIN1 KO hiNPCs showed a significant reduction in growth rate when compared to WT (Fig.
WT hiNPCs mainly expressed low molecular weight BIN1 isoforms, whereas in differentiated cultures both low and high molecular weight isoforms, probably corresponding to BIN1iso9 and BIN1iso1 respectively, were expressed (Fig.
The expression pattern observed for BIN1 isoforms likely reflects the mixed composition of the differentiated cell cultures at 6 weeks, comprising both neurons and astrocytes, which mainly express BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9, respectively
Likewise, BIN1 WT and KO hiPSCs were able to generate cerebral organoids with no obvious differences in size and composition (Fig.
Expression of BIN1 protein in 190-day-old BIN1 WT cerebral organoids was confirmed by western blot and showed a similar pattern as the one described in 2D cell cultures (Fig.
Next, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), we observed that cerebral organoids of both genotypes contain all major neural cell types, with no significant difference in the proportions of cell types (Fig.
We then performed differential gene expression analysis for all different cell types identified in BIN1 WT and KO cerebral organoids using DESeq2
We observed 41 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 0.7 < FC > 1.3 and FDR < 0.01) in glutamatergic neurons and 43 DEGs in astrocytes (Fig.
All the other cell types showed none or only 1-2 DEGs (Additional file 9: Table
Importantly, even for the 41 DEGs observed in glutamatergic neurons, no significant enrichment for gene ontologies associated with endocytic pathway was observed (Additional file 10: Table
These findings indicate that BIN1 WT and KO hiPSC-derived neurons mainly differ by the expression of BIN1.
As a consequence, potential defects in the endosome pathway in these cell models are likely not due to major transcriptional modifications but due to a direct action of BIN1 protein and its interaction with other proteins.
APP metabolism and endosome trafficking are tightly interconnected processes

These hiPSCs, in turn, were used to generate intermediate hiNPCs, and subsequently, mixed cultures of hiNs and hiAs.

To probe whether BIN1 deletion could affect amyloidogenic APP processing in hiNs, we measured the levels of the APP β-CTF in cerebral organoids and 2D cell cultures (Additional file 11: Fig.
We found a significant reduction in the levels of APP β-CTF normalized either by ACTIN or full-length APP in BIN1 KO compared to WT cerebral organoids (Additional file 11: Fig.
A similar trend was observed in 2D cell cultures, but without reaching statistical significance (Additional file 11: Fig.

BIN1 null mutation is associated with smaller early-endosome vesicles in hiPSC-derived neurons
In order to probe the impact of BIN1 null mutation in hiNs, we quantified the number and size of the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1)-expressing endosomes in microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-expressing cells in both 2D cultures and cerebral organoids (Fig.
EEA1 is an early endosomal Rab5 effector protein that has been implicated in the docking of incoming

Red dots indicate genes with fold change (FC) > 1.3 and false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.01 endocytic vesicles before fusion with early endosomes
We observed a significant change in the cumulative distribution of EEA1 + endosome volumes in hiNs both in 2D cultures and cerebral organoids, mostly due to a predominance of small volume endosomes in BIN1 KO compared to WT hiNs (Fig.
Conversely, no significant change in the number of endosomes was observed in hiNs of both genotypes (Fig.
These data suggested that BIN1 is involved in the regulation of early endosome size in human neurons.

BIN1iso1 specifically modulates sizes of the early-endosome vesicles
We then wondered whether the function of BIN1 in endocytosis could also be isoform-specific in human neurons, as observed in Drosophila.
To test this possibility, we set out to perform lentiviral-mediated transfection with fluorophore-expressing BIN1iso1, BIN1iso9 or control plasmids in hiNs at 3 weeks of differentiation.
After 3 additional weeks, we quantified the number and size of EEA1-expressing endosomes in transfected hiNs identified by tdTomato expression (Fig.
We observed that expression of BIN1iso1, but not BIN1iso9, in BIN1 KO hiNs fully rescued the volume of EEA1 + endosomes to values similar of those observed in WT hiNs (Fig.
We also over-expressed BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9 in WT hiNs.
Consistent with our previous observation in flies, we observed that BIN1iso1 overexpression in neurons led to an increase of large volumes EEA1 + endosomes, whereas the opposite effect was observed in neurons overexpressing BIN1iso9 (Fig.
Neither in BIN1 WT nor in KO hiNs did we observe significant changes in the number of puncta per cell after BIN1iso1 or BINiso9 overexpression (Fig.
Lastly, we evaluated whether BIN1iso1 overexpression could have a neurotoxic effect in hiNs.
To that end, we quantified the proportion of MAP2 + neurons in 6 weeks cultures after transduction with BIN1iso1-, BIN1iso9-or control-tdTomato + cells.
We found that BIN1iso1 overexpression led to a 30% reduction in the proportion of neurons compared to controls (Fig.
Interestingly, this effect of BIN1iso1 was not observed in BIN1 KO cells, suggesting that only supra-physiological expression levels of this isoform could be toxic for neurons.
Altogether, these observations indicate that BIN1iso1 expression is sufficient to regulate endosome volumes, even in the absence of other BIN1 isoforms in BIN1 KO hiNs, and that increased expression of BIN1iso1 deregulates endosome size and can lead to degeneration of human neurons, as observed in Drosophila photoreceptors.

Discussion
In this work, we assessed the function and potential neurotoxicity of human BIN1 isoforms in Drosophila and human neurons.
We show a functional conservation of human BIN1 in Drosophila as BIN1iso1, BIN1iso8 and BIN1iso9 phenocopied dAmphA-induced photoreceptor neuron developmental defects and BIN1iso8 was able to rescue the locomotor defects associated with the loss of dAmph in Drosophila.
Expression of BIN1iso1 resulted in a progressive neurodegeneration of photoreceptor neurons that was isoform-specific and dose-independent.
The degeneration did not depend on the activation of the phototransduction cascade and was associated with a strong accumulation of vesicles harboring early and late endosomal markers.
These results suggested that a BIN1 isoform-specific alteration of the endosome-lysosome pathway could contribute to neuronal degeneration.
Accordingly, the degeneration was prevented by a loss of function of the early endosome regulator Rab5 and a gain of function of the recycling endosomal protein Rab11.
Lastly, we observed a conservation of BIN1iso1 function in hiNs in 2D cultures and in organoids.
Loss of BIN1 resulted in reduced size of early endosomes, whereas expression of BIN1iso1, but not BIN1iso9, was able to rescue the reduced size of early endosomes in the BIN1 KO hiNs.
As in Drosophila, overexpression of BIN1iso1 resulted in enlarged early endosomes and had neurotoxic effects in WT hiNs.
Our results indicate context-and isoform-specific functions of BIN1: (i) Expression of BIN1iso1, BIN1iso8 and BIN1iso9 altered photoreceptor neuron rhabdomere morphogenesis during development in an isoform-independent and dose-dependent manner, whereas in the adult photoreceptor neurons BIN1iso1 expression induced neurodegeneration in an isoformdependent and dose-independent manner; (ii) in human neurons, we observed a shift in BIN1 isoform expression from low molecular weight isoforms in hiP-SCs and NPCs (likely mainly BIN1iso9) to high molecular weight isoforms in hiNs (likely mainly BIN1iso1); (iii) BIN1iso1 expression rescued the size of BIN1deficient early endosomes contrary to BIN1iso9.
Collectively, these results argue for an important role of BIN1iso1 in mature neuronal cells and support the fact that BIN1iso1 is a neuron-specific isoform with specific functions in this cell-type
Furthermore, (i) BIN1 KO hiNs showed early endosomes of reduced size; (ii) in BIN1 KO hiNs, BIN1iso1 expression rescued early endosome sizes but did not lead to enlargement of these vesicles; and (iii) in WT hiNs, BIN1iso1 overexpression induced early endosome enlargement.
These results suggest that homeostatic BIN1iso1 expression levels need to be tightly regulated to allow proper endocytic trafficking in neurons.
Of note, BIN1iso9 overexpression in WT hiNs induced a reduction of early endosome size.
Since BIN1 forms dimers through its BAR domain
Interestingly, this may also indicate another level of complexity to regulate BIN1 functions at the protein level.
Our results support a direct role of BIN1iso1 in neurons at the early endosome crossroad as indicated (i) by the labeling of large vesicles with early endosome markers in Drosophila, (ii) by the Rab5 rescue experiment in Drosophila and (iii) by the early endosome size modulation in hiNs.
Of note, the phenotype with very large vesicles in Drosophila likely results from Drosophila being a heterologous system for human BIN1iso1, and as a consequence, exhibiting stronger phenotypes.
Additionally, in Drosophila, some of the vesicles also exhibited markers for late endosome/MVB and exceptionally, lysosome.
However, regulation of late endosome/MVB or lysosomal function did not modulate photoreceptor degeneration and secretion of exosomes did not appear to be blocked, suggesting that BIN1iso1 defect do not occur at this level.
BIN1 has been proposed to regulate endocytosis by interaction with clathrin, Adaptor Proteins (AP) and dynamins
Since some of these proteins are also involved in vesicle budding of the intracellular organelles
Overexpressing Rab11 would overcome this inhibition through the activation of endosome recycling, decompress enlarged endosomes and explain the rescuing effect of a gain of Rab11 that we observed.
In support of this direct action of BIN1iso1 on endosomes, (i) we observed BIN1iso1 on the large endosomal vesicles in Drosophila, (ii) BIN1 knockout in cerebral organoids reduced endosome size without impacting expression of genes involved in the endosome trafficking pathway, and (iii) in Drosophila, BIN1iso1 toxicity was dependent on the CLAP domain, which is known to directly bind intracellular trafficking proteins like clathrin and APs
This regulation of early endosomes correlates with a broader role of BIN1 in the regulation of intracellular trafficking ranging from endocytosis
Interestingly, a growing body of evidence supports a dysregulation of the endosomal-lysosomal system as a plausible underlying mechanism in AD pathogenesis
Several AD susceptibility genes identified by GWAS (BIN1, PICALM, EPHA1, CD2AP, SORL1 and RIN3) encode proteins that function predominantly in endocytic trafficking
Endosome enlargement has been described to be the first cytopathological marker of AD, before the emergence of plaques and tangles
Several human AD cell models, namely hiNs originating from sporadic and familial AD patients
In AD and Down syndrome, these defects are associated with an overactivation of Rab5
We have also shown that BIN1iso1 effects in Drosophila are Rab5dependent.
Early endosomes are a major site of APP processing by β-secretase to yield APP β-CTF.
Therefore, alterations in endocytic pathways can affect APP metabolism and this likely explain the decrease in APP β-CTF we observed in the BIN1 knocked-out hiNs.
Reciprocally, APP β-CTF mediates endosomal defects in fAD mutant hiNs
To do so, APP β-CTF activates Rab5 via APPL1
However, in our study, loss of Appl, the Drosophila ortholog of APP, did not rescue BIN1iso1-induced neurodegeneration, suggesting that APP β-CTF does not mediate BIN1iso1 toxicity.
The involvement of APP β-CTF have also been questioned in SORL1 knocked-out hiNs with contradictory results in two studies showing APP β-CTF-dependent or -independent endosomal defects
Another putative intermediate is Ras and Rab Interactor 3 (RIN3), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rab5 small GTPase family, which is located in a GWAS-defined AD susceptibility locus
Upregulation of RIN3 induces endosomal dysfunction through Rab5
Further experiments would be, thus, of interest to test RIN3 as an intermediate for BIN1iso1 neurotoxicity.
Finally, we show that BIN1iso1 endosomal defects and toxicity can be attenuated by a gain of function of Rab11, which dovetails with data showing a colocalization of BIN1 with Rab11
Overall, our results strongly support a role of BIN1 in the endosomal dysregulation observed in AD.
Since we observed endosome enlargement and neurodegeneration upon BIN1iso1 overexpression, our results also suggest that an increase in BIN1iso1 may be deleterious to neurons and contribute to early phases of AD pathology through early endosome alterations.
It implies an increase in BIN1iso1 levels in neurons, which remains elusive.
To date, most experiments showing altered BIN1 expression in the AD brain have focused in samples obtained at late stages of the pathology
Therefore, at this point, it is not possible to establish a clear link between levels of BIN1 expression in neurons and AD pathogenesis.
Due to the numerous biological roles of BIN1 in AD pathophysiology, it is parsimonious to envisage that both upand down-regulation of BIN1 isoforms expression in the human brain could affect disease progression through different cell-type specific mechanisms, including the endosomal abnormalities described here.
Future studies should also address the possibility that BIN1 polymorphisms associated with an increased AD risk could affect the expression of BIN1iso1 in neurons.
Interestingly, the variant rs59335482, an insertion allele associated with a higher AD risk, is able to increase transcriptional activity in a luciferase assay in vitro using HEK cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and is also associated with an increase in BIN1 mRNA expression in the brain
However, individual BIN1 isoforms were not analyzed in this study.
Other variants, rs6733839 and rs13025717, in linkage disequilibrium with the abovementioned variant, have been shown to be located in a region enriched in microglia-specific enhancers
Deletion of a large 363 bp promoter region containing these variants in hiPSCs resulted in a decrease of BIN1 expression specifically in human induced microglia, but not in Neurog2-induced hiNs.
Unfortunately, neither the transcriptional effect of the exact variants nor the expression of BIN1 in spontaneously differentiated hiNs have been tested yet.
In addition, the possibility that the impact of functional variants may depend on specific AD pathophysiological process, e.g.
Aβ exposure, has not been assessed.
There is, thus, a high uncertainty about functional variants in the BIN1 locus.
Even if our current study was not intended to directly assess functional consequences of AD risk-related BIN1 polymorphisms but to focus on BIN1 isoforms function in neurons, which are still insufficiently described and understood, it may provide a context for BIN1-associated risk, namely the dysregulation of early endosome size and function.
Up to now and not exclusive from each other, BIN1 polymorphisms have been associated with Tau but not amyloid loads in post-mortem AD brain tissue

Conclusions
In conclusion, an increase of BIN1iso1 in neurons could contribute to AD pathogenesis by increasing the size of early endosomes observed early in the pathogenic process and by inducing neurodegeneration.
Other AD genetic determinants have also been shown to regulate early endosome size, supporting early endosome defects as a major event in the pathogenesis of AD.

e Quantification of BIN1iso1-induced photoreceptor neuron degeneration over 4 weeks under a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (Ctrl L and BIN1iso1 L) or under constant darkness (Ctrl D and BIN1iso1 D) (Kruskal Wallis p = 0.0005344 for Day8-11, p = 3.264 × 10 -05 for Day15-16, p = 1.36 × 10 -07 for Day28-29, followed by Mann Whitney comparison, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
Loss of light did not prevent neurodegeneration although the intensity of degeneration was reduced.

Fig.3BIN1iso1-induced degeneration is characterized by a strong accumulation of vesicles showing endosomal markers.
a Electron microscopy images of retina expressing Luciferase (Ctrl), AmphA, BIN1iso1 and BIN1iso9 from 15-day-old flies. 1 to 2 ommatidia transversal sections are seen on the 4 left images.
One photoreceptor neuron is outlined per image, its cytoplasm and nucleus being highlighted in yellow and its rhabdomere in green.
Each ommatidium contains 6 outer photoreceptor neurons whose rhabdomeres are organized in a trapezoidal shape, with a 7th rhabdomere in the middle corresponding to one of the two inner photoreceptor neurons.
In the BIN1iso1 condition, only 4 rhabdomeres can be seen.
In addition, the cytoplasm of the photoreceptor is filled with vesicles, some of them (highlighted in magenta) are very big.
These vesicles are surrounded by a single membrane (arrow on the right panel) as compared to the nuclear envelope (double arrow).
Their rhabdomere is usually disintegrating (*).
b Scheme of the organelles tested in photoreceptor neurons with the markers used.
c, d Images of photoreceptor neurons expressing BIN1iso1 and EYFP-tagged endogenous Rab5 and GFP:2xFYVE, as early endosome markers (c), or EYFP-tagged endogenous Rab7 and evi:GFP, as late endosome/multivesicular body markers (d).
Rh1 and actin staining, respectively yellow and magenta in the merge image, are used to label retina structure of 15-day-old flies.
The photoreceptor neurons expressed Luciferase as a control or BIN1iso1.
In the BIN1iso1 conditions, many vesicles were positive for the tested organelle markers (arrows, green staining in merge images).
The extracellular inter-rhabdomeric staining for the evi:GFP marker (arrowhead) corresponds to exosomes.
