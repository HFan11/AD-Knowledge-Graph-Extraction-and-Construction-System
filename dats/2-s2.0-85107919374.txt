Reversible GABAergic dysfunction involved in hippocampal hyperactivity predicts early-stage Alzheimer disease in a mouse model
Background: Neuronal hyperactivity related to β-amyloid (Aβ) is considered an early warning sign of Alzheimer disease (AD).
Although increasing evidence supports this opinion, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown.
Methods: Here, we recorded whole-cell synaptic currents and membrane potentials using patch clamping of acute hippocampal slices from human amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 transgenic (5XFAD) mice and their wild-type littermates.
Biochemical methods, electron microscopic imaging, behavioral tests, and intraventricular drug delivery applied with osmotic pumps were used in this study.
Results: We confirmed hyperactivity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in 5XFAD mice using whole-cell electrophysiological recording at 2.5 months old, when local Aβ-positive plaques had not developed and only mild cognitive dysfunction occurred.
We further discovered attenuated inhibitory postsynaptic currents and unchanged excitatory postsynaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons, in which the intrinsic excitability was unchanged.
Moreover, the density of both γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A ) receptor subunits, α1 and γ2, was reduced in synapses of the hippocampus in transgenic mice.
Intriguingly, early intervention with the GABA A receptor agonist gaboxadol reversed the hippocampal hyperactivity and modestly ameliorated cognitive performance in 5XFAD mice under our experimental conditions.
Conclusions: Inhibitory postsynaptic disruption critically contributes to abnormalities in the hippocampal network and cognition in 5XFAD mice and possibly in AD.
Therefore, strengthening the GABAergic system could be a promising therapy for AD in the early stages.

Background
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia that features extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles
Although overproduction or accumulation of Aβ, which is generated from its precursor protein (APP), is considered to have a leading role in AD pathophysiology
The optimal function of a neural circuit is dependent on the effective information processing of individual synapses.
The ensemble of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to postsynaptic action potential (AP) conversion determines specialized circuit functions during cognitive processes.
The hippocampus is responsible for computing contextual and spatiotemporal information and is an indispensable brain region for learning and memory processes.
An imbalance of the inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in the hippocampus results in disrupted AP outputs, mainly from pyramidal neurons
Derangement of the neural circuitry and subsequent epileptiform activity in the hippocampus is considered a critical event involved in AD
Although functional synaptic failure and related neural circuit aberrance in some regions of the brain in AD are widely accepted as critical events in the whole process of AD
It has been assumed that hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity associated with epileptic seizures is a very early functional impairment, is even a surrogate marker in patients with AD and animal models, and occurs before extracellular Aβ deposition
Yet, how presynaptic or postsynaptic components contribute to neuronal hyperactivity and ultimate neural network disintegration and cognitive disorder in AD is poorly understood.
Our previous observations and other studies have revealed attenuated excitatory synaptic transmission
However, the early phenotypes related to AD pathology and the mechanism involved in brain region-specific neuronal hyperactivity in AD remain to be clarified.
In the present study, we sought to explore the mechanism involved in hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity that is correlated with cognitive deficits in early disease stages in an AD mouse model.
First, we confirmed that hyperactivity of pyramidal neurons in CA1 preceded Aβ-related pathology and was accompanied by mild cognitive impairments in 5XFAD transgenic mice.
Further investigation revealed that the aberrant AP output from CA1 pyramidal neurons was driven by γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A ) receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic decline.
Most importantly, GABA A receptor agonist could reverse the decline in cognitive performance in the mouse model.
Thus, we propose that functional decline in inhibitory synaptic transmission critically contributes to hippocampus hyperactivity and cognitive deficits in the early stages of AD-like conditions.
Therefore, activating GABA A receptors could be a promising path to early intervention of AD.

Methods
Animal model and brain slices recordings APP/PS1 (5XFAD) double transgenic mice (006554, Jackson Laboratory) carrying human APP and PS1 transgenes containing five FAD mutations (APPSwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V) under the transcriptional control of the neuron-specific mouse Thy-1 promoter were bred in strict accordance with Chinese regulations involving animal protection.
The animal experiment was approved by the animal ethics committee of Capital Medical University.
Mice were maintained by crossing heterozygous transgenic mice with C57BL/6 wild-type breeders.
We used female heterozygous mice in electrophysiological recordings and male heterozygous in behavioral tests, aged between 2.5 and 3.5 months, and non-transgenic wild-type age-matched littermates served as the control group.
Under chloral hydrate (I.P. 300 mg/kg) anesthesia, mice were transcardially perfused with cutting solution, and the brains were immediately removed and cut with a vibratome (Leica, VT1200S).
For cell recordings, the slices were placed in a recording chamber constantly perfused with ACSF (Supplementary Information).

Subcellular fractionation
Shared with the above electrophysiological experiment when needed.
Fractions were prepared as described previously with a few modifications (Supplementary Information).

Western blotting
Equal amounts of proteins, which were quantified with BCA protein assay kit (23225, Pierce TM) from WT and FAD fractions were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
Then, the membranes were incubated with various primary antibodies (Supplementary Information).

ELISA
The mouse brain tissues were homogenized in cold RIPA buffer.
The supernatant and the pellet were separated for soluble and insoluble Aβ detections, respectively, with kits (KHB3441, KHB3481, Invitrogen) (Supplementary Information).

Biocytin labeling and immunostaining
Neuronal morphology and spine density of CA1 neurons were determined by adding biocytin (0.04%) in the pipette solution during whole-cell recording.
Specific antibodies recognizing subunits of GABA A receptors or AMPA receptors were used in immunofluorescent detection.
Avidin-biotin complex (ABC) staining was used to determine Aβ-positive signals (Supplementary Information).

Electron microscopic imaging
Brain tissues were punched and subjected to sequential preparation for imaging of transmission electron microscope (HITACHI, JAPAN, HT7700) (Supplementary Information).

Behavior and drug treatment
Paradigms of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and episodic-like memory were utilized to estimate hippocampus-dependent cognition of mice.
For drug treatment in vivo, intraventricular delivery was performed to mimic local perfusion as applied in slice recording (Supplementary Information).

Statistical analysis
All data were first tested for normality.
Datasets that passed the normality test were subjected to parametric tests with unpaired t-test for two groups comparison or one/two-way ANOVA for more than two groups comparison.
The data which did not pass the normality test were analyzed by non-parametric tests.
The analysis software was GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 (detailed statistical reports can be found in Supplementary Table

Results

CA1 neuronal hyperactivity preceded local Aβ deposition and was accompanied by mild cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice
We first examined the phenotypical characteristics of WT and 5XFAD mice.
The CFC was applied to differentiate hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory, showing significant attenuated performance in 5XFAD mice at the age of 4.5 months compared with their WT littermates.
At 2.5 months old, although the 5XFAD mice had no significant change in freezing percentage on average, these mice varied individually (Fig.
Interestingly, in episodic-like memory tests (Fig.
This result may reflect mild symptoms of AD in which recent memory reflects early memory impairment in the AD process
Furthermore, we used an index of displaced familiar objects vs. stationary familiar objects to evaluate cognition with contextual information.
The 5XFAD mice at 5.5 months old showed an impaired ability to discriminate stationary object A, which carried "old" information in association with episodiclike memory (Fig.
Intriguingly, despite showing non-significance compared with WT control mice, all transgenic mice at 2.5 months old had no ability to recognize the stationary object A (Fig.
These results imply that hippocampal functions would have been damaged at 2.5 months of age in the 5XFAD mice.
In addition, the 5XFAD mice at 2.5-3.5 months old exhibited a dramatic increase in insoluble Aβ (Supplementary Figure
At ages 2.5-3 months, male 5XFAD mice showed a pathological phenotype that was comparable with that of female 5XFAD mice.
We therefore performed physiological experiments using female mice and tested behaviors using male mice to avoid possible effects of the menstrual cycle in the present study.
To evaluate the firing state of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the mice, we prepared acute hippocampal slices and recorded the spontaneous action potential (sAP) with a whole-cell current clamp.
The frequency of sAP in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of 5XFAD mice at 2.5 months old was moderately enhanced compared with WT mice (p = 0.038; Fig.
Considering that the resting membrane potential (Fig.
In a neuron, a higher input resistance may result in the depolarization threshold in the AP being easily reached.
Therefore, we measured input resistance by applying subthreshold step-current injections with a duration of 500 ms, and rheobase with brief step-current injections with a duration of 3 ms sequentially.
Consistently, both the input resistance and the rheobase of CA1 pyramidal neurons in 5XFAD mice were comparable with that of WT mice (Fig.
These results confirmed that neuronal hyperactivity in the hippocampal CA1 precedes local extracellular Aβ accumulation in the AD mouse model.
In addition, the intrinsic neuronal excitability was unchanged by the APP/PS1 transgenic background at this age, suggesting synaptic dysfunction underlying CA1 neuronal hyperactivity in the early stage of AD pathophysiology.

Activity-dependent excitatory synaptic transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons of 5XFAD mice was unchanged
As the intrinsic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons were not altered, we determined whether inhibitory or excitatory synaptic transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons contributed to the hyperactivity in the transgenic hippocampus.
We first measured mEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal whole-cell recordings.
The slight increases in amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs of CA1 pyramidal neurons in 5XFAD slices (Fig.
As the miniature synaptic events were recorded in the presence of TTX, which blocked activity-dependent synaptic transmission, we further recorded evoked AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs (AMPAR-EPSCs) at the holding potential of -60 mV, responding to incremental stimulus intensities applied at Schaffer collateral.
In contrast to the changes in miniature events, as stimulus intensity increased, CA1 pyramidal neurons in the 5XFAD brain slices showed a decreasing trend, but with no statistical change in AMPAR EPSC amplitude (Fig.
The paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) at multiple interstimulus intervals (Fig.
The result of the activity-dependent synaptic responses suggested that the basic excitatory synaptic transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons can be assumed to be compensatory in early stages of the AD-like process.
To determine whether the dendritic morphology of CA1 pyramidal neurons was changed, we included biocytin in the intracellular recording pipette during whole-cell recording and performed observations with confocal microscopy (Fig.
The 5XFAD neurons showed dendrite spine density and surface area comparable to those of WT neurons (Fig.
Observations by electron microscopy revealed supportive evidence that the number of asymmetric synapses, the cleft width of synapses, and the length and width of postsynaptic density were all intact in the transgenic mouse hippocampus (Fig.

Inhibitory synaptic transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons was attenuated in the brain of 5XFAD mice
In contrast to mEPSCs, the mIPSCs of FAD CA1 pyramidal neurons displayed a decrease in amplitude and a slight increase in frequency as compared with WT neurons (Fig.
The cumulative distribution of mIPSCs in 5XFAD neurons consistently displayed a shift to lower amplitude or higher frequency (Fig.
This result suggested that inhibitory synaptic transmission is probably damaged in early stages of the AD-like process.
To further determine activity-dependent inhibitory synaptic transmission, we recorded evoked GABA A receptor-mediated IPSC (eIPSC) current using electrostimulation at Schaffer collateral in the absence of TTX, with QX314 in a pipette to block the voltage-gated sodium channel in the recorded cell.
As expected, we observed a suppressed response to higher stimulus intensities (80-100 μA) and a pronounced reduction in (See figure on previous page.)

In J and K, unpaired t-test with Welch's correction was applied.
Except for H, all values are presented as mean ± SEM.
L Subthreshold stimulation was constituted of current injections from -30 to + 30 pA in a duration of 500 ms, and the input resistance of CA1 pyramidal neurons in WT and 5XFAD mice was determined by Ohm's law. the input/output slope of eIPSCs in 5XFAD slice neurons compared with WT neurons (Fig.
Given that the response of the postsynaptic membrane can be attributed to either a presynaptic release probability or function of postsynaptic receptors, we checked the PPRs of eIPSCs in these neurons.
Notably, the 5XFAD neurons had higher PPRs than those of WT neurons (Fig.
As GABA A receptors mediate IPSCs, we also conducted immunofluorescent imaging of GABA A receptor subunit α1.
Intriguingly, α1 expression displayed a regional selective decrease in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of CA1, with a normal level of MAP2 expression in the 5XFAD brain (Fig.
Given that the SLM is a subfield, the apical dendrites of the CA1 pyramidal neurons are located in and accept direct inputs from the entorhinal cortex
Our result implies that the integration of inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 would most likely be damaged by the early ADrelated microenvironment.
GABA A receptors can mediate either phasic synaptic transmission or tonic inhibition via activation of extrasynaptic GABA A receptors caused by GABA release from reactive astrocytes owing to AD pathology
Therefore, we recorded tonic current induced by the GABA A blocker bicuculline in the presence of GABA and GABA uptake inhibitor.
We found that the AD transgenic background neither increased the degree of the tonic response of CA1 pyramidal neuron nor affected the astrocytic immunoreactivity (Supplementary Figure
GABA A receptor sensitivity to agonist was reduced, accompanied by decreased subunit density in the synapses in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice
We next asked whether the decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission was due to a decrease in the total level of these receptors or only their altered distribution in the synapses.
To answer this question, we separated the synapses from total hippocampal extracts of 2.5-monthold 5XFAD and WT mice.
The distribution of GABA A R α1 in both cytosolic fractions (P1) and membraneassociated fractions (P2) in 5XFAD hippocampal synapses was significantly reduced, with normal total protein levels, as compared with WT mice (Fig.
Because α1/β/γ2 containing heteropentameric GABA A receptors are predominantly located in brain synapses
In the same experimental system, AMPA Rs subunits, GluA1 and GluA2, exhibited normal levels of cytosolic and membrane fractions, except for a lower membrane fraction level in GluA1 than that of WT mice (Fig.
However, we found no obvious change in GluA1 immunostaining in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice (Supplementary Figure
These findings indicated that the GABA A receptors displayed a decline in synaptic distribution, with a normal reserve pool, and probably maintained repairable synaptic function.
Therefore, we added a GABA A receptor agonist, GBX in ACSF, to treat current-clamped neurons and observed a retarded response of 5XFAD neurons in discharging change (after 4 min of perfusion with ACSF-containing GBX); WT neuron displayed a fast drop in firing frequency after 2 min of GBX treatment (Fig.
Despite the delayed (See figure on previous page.)
Fig.
A Representative traces show miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons from WT or 5XFAD mice.
B, C Amplitude (B) and frequency (C) of mEPSCs were analyzed, n (WT) = 14 neurons/7 mice, n (FAD) = 14 neurons/9 mice.
For amplitude, the data were subjected to a two-tailed unpaired t-test, *p = 0.0153 for FAD (15.47 ± 0.46 pA) vs. WT (13.72 ± 0.49 pA); for frequency, the data did not pass normality tests and were subjected to a Mann-Whitney test, *p = 0.0301 for FAD vs. WT.
D, E Cumulative probability plots show the distribution of amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs in WT and 5XFAD neurons.
response to GBX, 5XFAD abnormal firing was eventually repressed by the GABA A agonist, suggesting on the one hand that the functional decline in GABA A receptors may play a key role in CA1 neuronal hyperactivity and, on the other hand, that AD-like phenotypes in the early stages could be intervened using GABA A receptor agonists.

Activating GABA A receptors modestly ameliorated cognitive performance in 5XFAD mice
We further asked if the functional decline in inhibitory synaptic transmission was specifically a critical causative event in AD progression and whether activating the GABA A receptors could rescue cognitive behaviors in the AD model in the early stages.
Thus, we treated 5XFAD mice at 3.5 months old with GBX, which is a metabolically stable GABA A receptor agonist that has been used in the treatment of sleep order
We used osmotic pumps to deliver the drug in local concentrations of 5 μM, which is equal to that used in slice perfusion, at a speed of 0.25 μL/h to provide continuous unilateral intraventricular drug treatment; the treatment lasted for 28 days (Fig.
Under these conditions, the hippocampus should be the main area receiving the drug effect.
In the CFC test, there was no significant difference in the percent of freezing time in the context trial between GBX-Fig.

Discussion
Neuronal hyperactivity is considered an early warning sign of AD
Aβ-related excitotoxicity
Here, we confirmed that CA1 pyramidal neuronal hyperactivity preceded local extracellular Aβ deposition in the 5XFAD mouse hippocampus, with early AD-like behavioral deficits.
Furthermore, the decline in the inhibitory synaptic transmission, rather than the excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic properties of the CA1 pyramidal neurons, contributed to aberrant neuronal activation in the early stages of the AD model.
The decrease in GABA A receptor localization in hippocampal synapses and the related diminished synaptic response mainly contributed to Aβ-associated hyperactivity (Supplementary Figure
Most importantly, memory impairment in the 5XFAD mouse model was partially reversed by GABA A strengthening in vivo.
Thus, we propose a novel opinion that functional decline in inhibitory synaptic transmission due to reduced postsynaptic localization of GABA A receptors plays a causative role in We previously found that hippocampus-dependent cognitive ability in the 5XFAD mouse model declined at 4 months of age with the commonly used protocol of the Morris water maze
However, the ability of reversal learning and memory, as well as LTP expression in the hippocampus, declined in the 5XFAD mice compared with their WT littermates as early as 2-3 months old
Accumulating evidence shows that the dendritic structure is altered in the hippocampal neurons of patients with AD and in animal models
Neuronal hyperexcitability in the 5XFAD mouse hippocampus has been attributed to dendritic structural degeneration
Although CA1 neuronal hyperactivity was confirmed in our study (Fig.
In consideration of our discovery of unaltered intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig.
Although we cannot exclude the possibility that CA1 neuronal hyperactivity was initiated by suppression of glutamate reuptake
Clinical evidence has shown that tissues isolated from the temporal cortices in the brain of patients with AD display a loss of GABA receptor subunits, α1 and γ2
In agreement with that study, a decrease in amplitude of IPSCs was observed in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of the 5XFAD model (Fig.
This finding strengthens our proposal that inhibitory inputs to CA1 neurons could be an early dysfunctional event in the AD pathological context.
Interestingly, the PPRs revealed an activity-dependent reduction in the inhibitory presynaptic release probability (Fig.
The data support an opinion of compensatory remodeling of inhibitory hippocampal circuits, as proposed by Palop et al., although those authors observed an increase in the amplitude of mIPSCs in the dentate gyrus of another AD mouse model
Presynaptic GABA B receptor 1a can bind to sAPPα, which is generated by α-secretase proteolysis of APP, to regulate presynaptic transmitter release
Therefore, the decreased activity-dependent presynaptic release probability may be attributed to AD-related mechanisms, e.g., amyloidogenic APP processing, although the mechanism needs further study.
Intriguingly, the GABA A α1 distributed in the SLM of the hippocampus was selectively reduced (Fig.
Given that the SLM receives projections from the entorhinal cortex
Nevertheless, how the trisynaptic circuit entorhinal cortex-CA3-CA1 integrates with the direct circuit entorhinal cortex-CA1 should be carefully investigated in future work.
Considering the presynaptic mechanisms, inhibitory interneurons in CA1 local circuits may contribute to network dysfunction under AD conditions, as dysfunction of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons
Importantly, Schmid et al.
Nevertheless, how inhibitory interneurons interact with pyramidal neurons to regulate CA1 local circuits requires further study using a double-patch recording system.
Another interesting study demonstrated that Aβ treatment can specifically reduce inhibitory transmission at the dendritic synapses
Although loss of GABA A receptors and inhibitory synaptic dysfunction associated with AD has been previously discussed
The α1 subunit-containing GABA A receptors are mainly located on the postsynaptic membrane and mediate phasic inhibition in the brain
Our finding of a loss of function of GABA A receptors in the 5XFAD hippocampus was consistent with clinical evidence that AD patient-derived cell membranes displayed a reduction in GABA-mediated currents
In addition, we found decreased localization of the GABA A α1 subunit in the synaptic membrane but with a normal reserve pool in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.
Hence, an early therapeutic window during which neuronal activity would be remodeled is proposed.
As expected, the GABA A agonist GBX eventually suppressed the neuronal hyperactivity (Fig.
GBX is a hypnotic drug that has been reported to act on extrasynaptic GABA A receptors to drive tonic inhibition in the neocortex
Here, we suggest that inhibitory synaptic transmission is strengthened by GBX, although we cannot rule out the possible contribution of extrasynaptic GABA A receptor-mediated conductance in this process.
Nevertheless, we found no changes in the tonic inhibitory current of CA1 neurons nor in reactive astrocytes (Supplementary Fig.
Notably, a recent study reported that systemic administration of GBX rescued the tau-induced adult hippocampal neurogenesis deficits and improved contextual cognition in AD mice
Together, this evidence suggests that strengthening the GABAergic system would be effective in both the Aβ-related and tau-related courses of AD.

Limitations
Here, we did not apply systemic treatment in the AD mouse model because we sought to first confirm the direct effect of strengthening GABA A receptors on the abnormal hippocampal network in vivo.
Therefore, further studies should be performed to explore a method of AD treatment targeting the GABAergic system that is safe, less toxic, and highly effective.

Conclusions
In recent years, the fact that many preclinical studies focusing on Aβ have been ineffective has pushed researchers in this field to seek more effective and promising strategies to cure or even prevent AD.
Our study suggests that GABAergic remodeling may be a useful path to re-orchestration of the hippocampal network in the early stage of AD, although the following open questions remain to be answered.
How does GABA A agonist regulate postsynaptic receptor redistribution?
How is the possible interaction of intracellular Aβ and GABA A receptors involved in the AD process?
Can activation of GABA A receptors restore functions of the cognitive network in the early stage of human AD?
